radical feminism
Bell and Klein have put together a powerful, dense, and interesting collection of essays about radical feminism, a political philosophy that "makes visible male control as it is exercised in every sphere of women's lives, both public and private." Writers include the familiar names in feminist philosophy-Robin Morgan, Catherine MacKinnon, Marcia Gillespie, and Andrea Dworkin-as well as those newer to the scene. Especially noteworthy here is the great effort of the editors to include writers from several countries and cultures. The selections demonstrate the editors' assertion that "radical feminism has always welcomed and acknowledged the diversity of women, while stressing commonality." Particularly interesting are the selections on "therapy and how it undermines the practice of radical feminism" and the group editing efforts of seven Generation X representatives who respond to the ongoing debate about MacKinnon's stand against pornography. At a time when Camille Paglia and others are denouncing the "second wave of feminism," these are important voices for feminists to read, and the book is full of the kind of discussion that is most exciting for feminists today.
