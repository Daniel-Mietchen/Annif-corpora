Introducing the reader to ancient scriptures, this work provides a systematic and accesible overview of Daoism (c. 2nd-6th centuries). Representative works from each of the principle Daoist traditions comprise the basic structure of the book, with each chapter accompanied by an introduction that places the material within an historical context. Included are translations from the earliest Daoist commentary to Laozi's "Daode jing" (Tao Te Ching); historical documents relating the history of the early Daoist church; a petitioning ritual used to free believers from complaints brought against them by the dead; and two complete scriptures, one on individual meditation practice and another designed to rescue humanity from the terrors of hell through recitation of its powerful charms. In addition, Bokenkamp elucidates the connections Daoism holds with other schools of thought, particularly Confucianism and Buddhism. Review: "A diligent search of previous scholarship would turn up much of this information, but it heretofore has not been gathered together in a single volume and never with the immediacy of the Daoists' own words. This book will surely lead to a greater understanding of Daoism among Sinologists and scholars of religion."--Terry Kleeman, "Journal of Asian Studies

The turning of the tide : religion in China today
Many Heavens, One Earth is a collection of first-person voices from nine of the world religions. In fifteen articles, devotees and scholars reveal the contributions these traditions make to informing and motivating an ecological response to the environmental issues that beset planet earth. The spiritual messages of world religions have an indispensable and decisive role to play in addressing these environmental problems, for, at their root, these ecological issues are spiritual problems: Unless greed is replaced by moderation and sharing, materialism by spiritual insights and values, consumerism by restraint and simpler living, exploitation by respect and service, and pollution by caring and protection, nature's hospitality will be foolishly rebuffed, and therefore our descendants will inherit a polluted and depleted earth. Religion can be, and must be, a part of this replacement. Since at least 90% of the world's people claim allegiance to various major world religious traditions, religion can exert a crucial and transforming influence.
