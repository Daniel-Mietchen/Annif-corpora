The aim of this book is not to provide yet another critique of capitalism but rather to contribute to the ongoing dialogue for post-capitalist construction, and to discuss how another world could be possible. It builds on the idea that peer-to-peer infrastructures are gradually becoming the general conditions of work, economy, and society, considering peer production as a social advancement within capitalism but with various post-capitalistic aspects in need of protection, enforcement, stimulation and connection with progressive social movements. Using a four-scenario approach, the authors seek to simplify possible outcomes and to explore relevant trajectories of the current techno-economic paradigm within and beyond capitalism. They postulate that the mature peer production communities pose a sustainable alternative to capital accumulation, that of the circulation of the Commons. They make some tentative transition proposals towards a Commons-based economy and society for the state, the market and the civic domain.--Provided by publisher.
Harvard University physicist Eric Mazur demonstrates the use of Peer Instruction (PI) and Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT), serving as an interactive workshop that can be used by individual teachers or in group training sessions to learn about these techniques, and implement them in the classroom. The documentary, From questions to concepts, provides an introduction to interactive teaching.

Childrens moral lives : an ethnographic and psychological approach
Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity explores the origins of prejudice and the emergence of morality to explain why children include some and exclude others. Formulates an original theory about children's experiences with exclusion and how they understand the world of discrimination based on group membership brings together social domain theory and social identity theory to explain how children view exclusion that often results in prejudice, and inclusion that reflects social justice and morality presents new research data consisting of in-depth interviews from childhood to late adolescence, observational findings with peer groups, and experimental paradigms that test how children understand group dynamics and social norms, and show either group bias or morality. Illustrates data with direct quotes from children along with diagrams depicting their social understanding presents new insights about the origins of prejudice and group bias, as well as morality and fairness, drawn from extensive original data. Social inclusion and exclusion are pervasive aspects of social life. Understanding when exclusion is legitimate or wrong reflects an understanding of morality. While there are times when exclusion is legitimate and fosters group functioning, there are also times when it reflects prejudicial biases and stereotypic expectations. How children weigh fairness and stereotypic expectations when making exclusion decisions is determined by their understanding of group norms, social identity, and friendships with children from other backgrounds. In our contemporary global society, few topics are as timely or pressing as exclusion. Children and Social Exclusion: Morality, Prejudice, and Group Identity delves deeply into the origins of prejudice and the emergence of morality to explain why children include some and exclude others and sheds light on the origins of stereotyping, prejudice, and social justice. By tackling these important issues from a global perspective, Children and Social Exclusion: Morality, Prejudice, and Group Identity illustrates how the concept of exclusion might be better understood in multiple cultures and reveals its implications in regions of conflict in the world.
