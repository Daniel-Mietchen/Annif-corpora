The calligrapher's bible : 100 complete alphabets and how to draw them
This collection of thirteen essays examines sixteenth-century type design in France. Typefaces developed during this period were to influence decisively the typography of the centuries which followed, and they continue to influence a great many contemporary typefaces. The papers' common goal is to establish the paternity of the typefaces described and critically to appraise their attributions, many of which have previously been inadequately ascribed. Such an approach will be of interest to type historians and type designers seeking better-documented attributions, and to historians, philologists, and bibliographers, whose study of historical imprints will benefit from more accurate type descriptions. The papers and illustrations focus on the most important letter-cutters of the French Renaissance, including Simon de Colines, Robert Estienne, Claude Garamont, Robert Granjon, Pierre Haultin, and also include a number of minor masters of the period.

Chosen to represent the key elements of form used by the punch cutters, calligraphers and designers of their day, and presented in chronological order by release date, each typeface is discussed in terms of its origins and its impact on the design and print industries, and considerations for screen use.00Versions released in metal type for hand-setting and for the Monotype and Linotype machines, as phototype, and as digital revivals or originals, are covered in detail alongside information about the people responsible for the design and development of each adaptation.00Key glyphs are annotated to indicate features that mark out how typeface design has evolved over the last 500 or so years. Visual comparisons illustrate how typefaces created years ago have influenced contemporary designs.00For the general reader, this book offers a thorough history of the typefaces we have been reading for decades; for typographers and designers, it is a valuable resource that will help to inform their choice of the most appropriate typeface for any project.
