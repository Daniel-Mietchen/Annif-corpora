The book presents the modern state of the art in the mathematical theory of compressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a particular emphasis on the applications to aerodynamics. The topics covered include: modeling of compressible viscous flows; modern mathematical theory of nonhomogeneous boundary value problems for viscous gas dynamics equations; applications to optimal shape design in aerodynamics; kinetic theory for equations with oscillating data; new approach to the boundary value problems for transport equations. The monograph offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to recent mathematical tools designed to handle the problems arising in the theory.

"What is Europe? Where does it begin and end? Who is a European? These questions have long been debated but never more so than in the early 21st century. Anna Triandafyllidou and Ruby Gropas show that there can be no single definition of Europe but that a lot can be learned from addressing its diverse meanings"--
