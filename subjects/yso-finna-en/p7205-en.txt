Trauma and Orthopaedics at a Glance is an easy-to-read, highly visual guide to orthopaedics. It comprehensively covers relevant basic science and clinically-oriented anatomy of the musculoskeletal system, and the diagnosis and management of trauma, sports injuries, paediatric orthopaedics, degenerative disease, and musculoskeletal tumours. Although primarily aimed at junior doctors and senior medical students, it is also useful for physiotherapists and nurse practitioners.

"Entry-level occupational therapists are expected to have fundamental skills in splinting theory, design, and fabrication. As occupational therapy students, they gain these skills through didactic courses, fieldwork, or observations. Orthotic Intervention of the Hand and Upper Extremity: Splinting Principles and Process, Second Edition, delivers just that. Instructors need materials to teach students how to apply theory to practice in the area of splinting. This book provides instructors with the pedagogical framework necessary to help students, inexperienced therapists, and expert hand therapists make the right decision whether to fabricate a thermoplastic or neoprene splint, cast, tape, or choose an over-the-counter splint for their patient. This detailed and easy-to-use reference demonstrates splint fabrication techniques and related interventions for the upper extremity and highlights anatomical and biomechanical principles specifically related to splints"--Provided by publisher.

"Evaluation and Management of Common Upper Extremity Disorders: A Practical Handbook answers the need for a comprehensive, yet concise reference that addresses practical solutions to everyday conditions that general orthopedic surgeons, and specialists alike, as well those involved with general musculoskeletal surgical and nonsurgical care, may encounter. This book provides information on how to diagnose, treat, and manage the most commonly encountered conditions of the upper extremity. Written in a bullet format, and including photos for quick, easy reference, the book contains valuable information for all levels of training and experience"--Provided by publisher.
