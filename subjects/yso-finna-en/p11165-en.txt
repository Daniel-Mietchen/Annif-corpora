This work concerns intelligence analysis of adversaries by six countries, the role of intelligence analysis during the Cold War, and its role in other important regional conflicts after 1945. It seeks to use Cold War and contemporary examples to determine how well intelligence has been analyzed and handled by different intelligence services and policymakers. The book reaches conclusions about past cases in intelligence analysis and how best to analyze intelligence and present it to policymakers today. The book also examines how well policymakers have received and understood intelligence. In sum, the volume analyzes how effective intelligence has been in the policymaking process. It will be a leading text on the analyst/policymaker relationship. The historical cases examined are the Soviet Union's analysis of the United States (and vice versa), East Germany's analysis of West Germany (and vice versa), British intelligence on the early years of the "Troubles" in Northern Ireland, Israeli intelligence on the Palestinians, Pakistani intelligence on India, and US intelligence about Islamist terrorists.
