Planning for play
Outdoor education offers children special contexts for play and exploration, real experiences and contact with the natural world and the community. To help ensure young children thrive and develop in your care, this book provides essential information on how to make learning outdoors a rich and valuable part of their daily life. Written by a team of experts in the field, this book focuses on the core values of effective outdoor provision, and is packed with ideas to try out in practice. Topics covered include: the role of play in learning outdoors; meaningful experiences for children outdoors; the role of the adult outdoors; creating a dynamic and flexible outdoor environment; dealing with challenge, risk and safety; and, including every child in outdoor learning. There are case studies of successful strategies in action, covering the Birth to 5 age range. Outdoor provision needs to be thoughtfully planned, well organised and appropriately supported by adults, and this book will help practitioners and students to lead good practice with confidence, so that they respond to the needs and interests of young children.
Nowhere is creativity of function so prevalent as in the world of children, and Play Indoor & Outdoor is a look at the burgeoning field of design and architecture that is being tailored to the scale, tastes, and necessities of a child s life. Contemporary, colorful, and often eco-friendly options are used in the schools and play centers from all over the world that are featured in this book, with projects from designers such as MAD, BP Architects, AIR Architecture, 70oN Arkitektur, Gonzalez Goodale Architects, Geneto, Lev-Gargir Architects, Matali Crasset, Kadawittfeldarchitektur, Baupiloten, and Haugen/Zohar Arkitekter.

"This timely and accessible text successfully introduces, theorises and practically applies emerging ideas which now increasingly underpin early years practice, that of 'playful learning' and 'playful pedagogies'. By drawing upon observation, interviews and filmed material in their study of play environments, Pat Broadhead and Andy Burt offer accessible insights into key theories as well bringing together their wealth of skills and knowledge to provide numerous ideas for practical application in classroom or early years settings. In both indoor and outdoor environments, the text explores 'open-ended role play', (or 'the whatever you want it to be place') and illustrates how themes in children's play reflect their interests, experiences, knowledge gained at home and cultural heritage. By showing how children become familiar and skilful within open-ended play environments, the authors have seen the children's co-operative skills develop over time as they become connected communities of learners. This book also demonstrates how interested parents can become when involved in playful learning. Parents' knowledge and understanding, alongside that of the educators', helps to build a bridge between home and school that makes playful learning a universally understood experience by all adults involved with the child. This insightful text will be of interest to students of early years education, early years practitioners, and researchers"-- Provided by publisher.
