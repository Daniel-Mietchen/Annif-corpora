This edited collection is intended as a primer for core concepts and principles in research ethics and as an in-depth exploration of the contextualization of these principles in practice across key disciplines. The material is nested so that readers can engage with it at different levels and depths. It is unique in that it combines an analysis of complex ethical debates about the nature of research and its governance with the best of case-based and discipline-specific approaches. It deals with the following topics in depth: in the natural sciences, it explores the scientific integrity of the researcher and the research process, human cloning as a test case for the limits to research, and the emerging ethical issues in nanotechnology; in the health sciences, it takes up the question of consent, assent and proxies, research with vulnerable groups and the ethics of clinical trials; in the social sciences, it explores the issues that arise in qualitative research, interviews and ethnography; and in the humanities, it examines contested archaeologies and research in divided societies. Overview of Research Ethics Principles Full text papers from experienced researchers across many disciplines Dialogue with ethicists.
Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis's own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about a collaboration between two men who became heroes in the university and on the battlefield -- both had important careers in the Israeli military -- and whose research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self-confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They worked together so closely that they couldn't remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter. This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind's view of its own mind.

Characteristics of Finnish medical and engineering research group work
Since the touchdown of the Opportunity Rover in 2004, we’ve become used to seeing photographs of Mars’s harsh, rocky landscape. Looking at these pictures, it feels as though for the first time we have a direct conduit to the surface of an alien planet, a photographic link to the eyes of a friendly robot (it even Tweets!) exploring a new world. Janet Vertesi reminds us that the real story is more complicated—but also more interesting. Behind each photograph the Opportunity sends back is a team of scientists, women and men who work to process, manipulate, and interpret each picture to render it legible to the public. Seeing like a Rover is the story of the team behind the phenomenally successful Rover mission, who work to bring Mars to Earthlings in beautiful pictures (many reproduced here) so vivid that we feel as though we have visited the Red Planet ourselves.

"The entire range of facilitation techniques is covered in this handbook, from pre-session tips in participant recruitment to post-session reporting. Moderating Focus Groups covers all the fundamentals of successful group facilitation, and also includes advanced techniques, such as managing group dynamics, energizing a tired group, and digging deeper into the minds of participants. Greenbaum also goes beyond the basics with chapters on how to build a business moderating focus groups, and how to price moderating services." "While this book is particularly aimed at the needs of focus group practitioners, there is plenty of advice that will benefit anyone who conducts in-depth interviews or group facilitation. Additionally, the many people who hire moderators to facilitate their sessions will benefit from this book because it will provide them with insights on how to evaluate their moderators' work."--BOOK JACKET.
