"Every paper was examined by at least two reviewers, and acceptance was based on their recommendations. Papers covered a wide variety of topics, including systematics, anatomy biogeography, and paleoecology. There were two new fossil taxa described in the volume to honor Dave Webb and his contributions to vertebrate paleontology. Most papers centered on Florida and the southeastern United States, although several were based on faunas from the western United States, Central America and South America" -- Pref.
