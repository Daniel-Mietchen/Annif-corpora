Cultivating diversity : agrobiodiversity and food security
Debunking the notion that our current food crisis must be addressed through industrial agriculture and genetic modification, author and activist Vandana Shiva argues that those forces are in fact the ones responsible for the hunger problem in the first place. Who Really Feeds the World? is a powerful manifesto calling for agricultural justice and genuine sustainability, drawing upon Shiva's thirty years of research and accomplishments in the field. She proposes that instead of relying on genetic modification and large-scale monocropping to solve the world's food crisis, we should look to agroecology —the knowledge of the interconnectedness that creates food— as a truly life-giving alternative to the industrial paradigm. Shiva succinctly and eloquently lays out the networks of people and processes that feed the world, exploring issues of diversity, the needs of small famers, the importance of seed saving, the movement toward localization, and the role of women in producing the world's food.

Volume 2: Focuses on the tensions that arise between people and wildlife on agricultural land, and explores how to mitigate them. It investigates the common sources of conflict and the consequential threats to conservation, discussing a variety of solutions and demonstrating the benefits of an evidence-based, interdisciplinary strategy.

Agroecology : the scientific basis of alternative agriculture
"Food security and environmental conservation are two of the greatest challenges facing the world today. It is predicted that food production must increase by at least 70% before 2050 to support continued population growth, though the size of the world's agricultural area will remain essentially unchanged. This updated and thoroughly revised second edition provides in-depth coverage of the impact of environmental conditions and management on crops, resource requirements for productivity and effects on soil resources. The approach is explanatory and integrative, with a firm basis in environmental physics, soils, physiology and morphology. System concepts are explored in detail throughout the book, giving emphasis to quantitative approaches, management strategies and tactics employed by farmers, and associated environmental issues. Drawing on key examples and highlighting the role of science, technology and economic conditions in determining management strategies, this book is suitable for agriculturalists, ecologists and environmental scientists"--

Volume 1: Integrates more than 30 years of research by the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford to reveal how agricultural systems and wildlife interact, presenting examples from scales varying from microcosm to landscape, individuals to populations, and covering plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, with the purpose of fortifying the evidence base for managing outcomes. It considers the implications of agricultural development for natural habitats, biodiversity, and the provision of essential ecosystem services.

Creating a Nordic regional research network in agroecology : links to MSc education
Provides a combination of selected case studies, combined with authoritative and thought-provoking editorial syntheses, to demonstrate how ecological study (often long term), combined with a flexible, interdisciplinary approach, is a consistently effective strategy to tackle the most pressing challenges facing farmers, conservationists, and policy makers today. It is aimed at student and professional academics as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers, both government and non-government.
