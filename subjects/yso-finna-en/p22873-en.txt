Priciples of performance engineering : for telecommunication and information systems
Communication networks are experiencing a significant growth of data traffic posing new challenges to the overall systems that should become more reactive and adaptive towards dynamically changing traffic, connections and network conditions. This thesis examines adaptive traffic management solutions within heterogeneous communication networks, which can be utilized to improve network performance, provide Quality of Service (QoS) for traffic paths and share resources in a fair way. The developed adaptive methods include solutions for fuzzy flow scheduling (AWFQ, FWQ) and regressive admission control (REAC) to provide stable network performance and efficient resource control. Such techniques for adaptive traffic management continuously balance and control traffic usage and recover from network faults and attacks. The results utilize traffic monitoring for estimating the overall network conditions, applying cognition to learn from previous actions, and adapting to the current traffic conditions for resource optimization. The thesis researches how to distribute these computing mechanisms towards network edges closer to the actual application users for more efficient resource usage, and to provide better performance for delay-sensitive applications. The methods developed have been applied to vehicular communications to assess and improve the messaging between vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs). These mechanisms are able to react faster to data traffic changes and guarantee better quality for prioritized traffic and users while at the same time they preserve fairness to other flows compared to traditional control and scheduling methods without adaptive characteristics. The overall system reacts to changes in the network QoS by determining decision-making procedures on possible flow rejection, marking, or allowed bandwidth weight assignment, thus bringing cognition to the network path.

"The primary purpose of this book is to capture the state-of-the-art in Cloud Computing technologies and applications. The book will also aim to identify potential research directions and technologies that will facilitate creation a global market-place of cloud computing services supporting scientific, industrial, business, and consumer applications. We expect the book to serve as a reference for larger audience such as systems architects, practitioners, developers, new researchers and graduate level students. This area of research is relatively recent, and as such has no existing reference book that addresses it. This book will be a timely contribution to a field that is gaining considerable research interest, momentum, and is expected to be of increasing interest to commercial developers. The book is targeted for professional computer science developers and graduate students especially at Masters level. As Cloud Computing is recognized as one of the top five emerging technologies that will have a major impact on the quality of science and society over the next 20 years, its knowledge will help position our readers at the forefront of the field"--Provided by publisher.
