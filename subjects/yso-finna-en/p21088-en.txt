Abstract.
Abstract: This report is a study into the possible application of social media within the communication strategy of Gassan Diamonds, a diamond wholesaler and retailer located in Amsterdam in The Netherlands. Gassan Diamonds has yet to implement a social media strategy so a knowledge gap was identified as to how this could be done. The research consisted of studying the current uses and trends in social media and combining it with tourism trends related to Amsterdam to develop a social media strategy targeted at tourists in Amsterdam travelling outside of a tour group.

International Public Relations: Perspectives from deeply divided societies is positioned at the intersection of public relations (PR) practice with socio-political environments in divided, conflict and post-conflict societies. While most studies of PR focus on the activity as it is practiced within stable democratic societies, this book explores perspectives from contexts that have tended to be marginalized or uncharted. Presenting research from a diverse range of societies still deeply divided along racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic lines, this collection engages with a variety of questions including how PR practice in these societies may contribute to our understanding of PR theory building. Importantly, it highlights the role of communication strategies for actors that still deploy political violence to achieve their goals, as well as those that use it in building peace, resolving conflict, and assisting in the development of civil society. Featuring a uniquely wide range of original empirical research, including studies from Israel/Palestine, Mozambique, Northern Ireland, former Yugoslavia, former Czechoslovakia, Spain, Malaysia and Turkey, this groundbreaking book will be of interest not only to scholars of public relations, but also political communication, international relations, and peace and conflict studies.

Information systems role in strategic agility : a supply chain context
Effective internal communications is one of the essential factors in an organization's strong performance. Internal communication involves negotiating, commanding, reporting, informing, coordinating, cooperating and motivating through various communication channels. This thesis was conducted for StyroChem Finland Oy, the leading Northern European supplier of expandable polystyrene (EPS). The sales network of StyroChem covers all of Europe, with offices in Denmark, Russia, Poland, Germany and the U.K. StyroChem is a privately owned organization currently employing about 90 people in six countries. The study focuses on selected key aspects of internal communication and communication channels at StyroChem Finland Oy. The aim of the research was to find out whether its employees are satisfied with internal communication. The purpose of this thesis is to enhance internal communication and the communication culture within the target organization. This thesis provides a general overview about the importance of efficient internal communication in an organization. The theoretical framework concentrates on analyzing the basic elements of both organizational and internal communication, such as communication strategy, communication channels and multicultural aspects. The empirical part of the study was carried out through a questionnaire comprised of structured and open questions. The results were analyses utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of this study indicate that in general internal communication at StyroChem can be said to have an open and positive character. However, the present working environment appears to be too demanding for some employees, who feel some level of dissatisfaction. This situation clearly has an overall negative effect on personnel's productivity and motivation. The result of this research should help in promoting further investigations and projects in this area at StyroChem.    Recommendations for improving internal communication in the target company include having more organized, relevant and open communication in order to influence employee engagement in organizational goals.
