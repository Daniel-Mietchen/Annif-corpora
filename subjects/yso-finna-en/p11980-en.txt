As well as introducing the reader to individual Greek tyrants, Greek Tyranny situates the phenomenon of tyranny within Mediterranean society as a whole, rather than treating it as an isolated episode. The title 'tyrant' became gradually less acceptable in Greek politics and the book aims to trace the changing attitudes of the Greeks towards autocratic rule, and the place that it occupied in the political life of Greece. The book covers the whole period between 750 and 250, treating tyrants from Cypselos and Phalaris to Agathocles and Hieron II. Its horizons are also broad; instead of concentrating on mainland Greece, the discussion draws examples and comparisons from Rome and Italy, Sicily, Asia Minor, Thessaly and the Black Sea. The book offers powerful new arguments on the subject of tyranny and Greek political life and redresses the usual overemphasis on fifth-century Athens and democracy by presenting some of the alternative forms of government prevalent in classical Greece. The inclusion of a very wide range of rulers (and the colourful traditions which surround them) make both a lively book and a well-contextualised study.
