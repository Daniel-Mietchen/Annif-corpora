The topic of this thesis was the development of a PLM system (Product Lifecycle Management) for the needs of a company. The PLM system used in this work was ENOVIA and an open source web application framework, Spring Framework, was used for the customization. This work is about customization possibilities and best practises of development that can be applied in similar projects. The goal was to produce a compilation of customizations so that someone who is starting out with similar development could perceive and realize the aspects under the big picture and to understand why tasks are carried out in certain way in certain environments. This thesis examines the use of the API (Application Programming Interface) of ENOVIA in customizations and the tools that the Spring Framework provides to make the customization simpler. This thesis also deals with useful action models relating to services, integrations and application architecture. With the guidance of this thesis, people working with similar tasks can get around the same mistakes, save time and learn about the use of a web application framework.

Abstract: Currently UPM plywood production has a tailor made reporting platform that handles all production related data. This reporting platform is called PlyNET and it is based on Mi-crosoft SQL Reporting Services (SSRS) technology. PlyNET platform is fully developed by the UPM IT-department and in the long run that could cause problems concerning product support and future development. During 2011-2012 UPM has implemented a standard MES solution for plywood production based on GE Intelligent Platforms' Proficy product family. This system is called PlyMES. the Proficy platform includes standard out-of-the-box reports, but these reports were found to be insufficient and needed to be extended or replaced. To be able to extend PlyMES reports and merge these with existing PlyNET reports, Novotek Report Plus (NRP) reporting tool was chosen as a candidate. Like PlyNET, the NRP platform is also based on standard SQL Server Reporting Services (SRSS) technology. Using NRP, UPM specific reports based on data in the PlyMES system can be designed and existing PlyNET reports can be merged together with PlyMES reports into single reporting portal. The goal of this thesis is to explore the possibility to use Novotek Report Plus as a single reporting portal for PlyMES and PlyNET reports. Alongside of this project WIP inventory balance, plywood average thickness and produced plywood quantity reports will be de-signed and created.

A modern approach to operations management
This thesis was done for Valmet Automotive, and especially for their projects. The purpose was to create supplier coaching material for Valmet Automotives logistics, as well any other potential materials needed for coaching. These materials can ensure that logistic coaching is done containing all prerequisite logistical areas. In addition, these materials enable functional and effective cooperation along with unproblematic supplier chain functions. The implementation of the coaching is also discussed in this thesis. The theoretical section consists of research into the new and global logistical environment. Changes resulting from moving operations mainly within Europe to global environment also introduce many new aspects to the supply chain, including communication, business cultures and wider supply chain management. In the empirical section the actual supplier coaching material for logistics is created, including all the different logistical areas in which suppliers need to receive instruction. Coaching materials also exist for current customers / suppliers, but this material can only be used as a checklist. In this new material the changes which the global logistical environment has brought to different logistical areas are examined.
