"Engage your employees with a mentoring program that spans across the generations. With a workforce full of varying degrees of experience, the focus is often on the challenges of balancing a multigenerational staff. But what can be overlooked is what these generations can learn from each other. Senior members in organizations have expressed that they continually want to learn--and not only teach. These findings lead Reitman and Benatti to create the Mentoring Partnership Model, which is a way for new and seasoned employees to partner and learn from each other. This book is a two-part presentation of how to implement this model into your organization: a facilitator's handbook outlining the process and a participant's workbook complete with worksheets and templates. Use the Mentoring Partnership Model to pass on knowledge and retain and engage employees. Covers the characteristics of an effective mentor and why mentoring works. Offers step-by-step instructions of each stage of the program. Includes the worksheets, evaluation forms, and checklists to use in your program." --
Training That Delivers Results offers a far better way to educate employees, one that connects learning solutions with strategic business goals. Rather than being told what to teach, proactive designers collect data to define problems and develop training interventions. Written by one of the originators of computer-based training, Handshaw's results-oriented model is systematic, yet flexible, and works for both instructor-led training and e-learning.

How do you tailor education to the learning needs of adults? Do they learn differently from children? How does their life experience inform their learning processes? These were the questions at the heart of Malcolm Knowles' pioneering theory of andragogy which transformed education theory in the 1970s. The resulting principles of a self-directed, experiential, problem-centred approach to learning have been hugely influential and are still the basis of the learning practices we use today. Understanding these principles is the cornerstone of increasing motivation and enabling adult learners to achieve. This update of a pioneering classic contains all Knowles' original chapters alongside a newer second part by Elwood Ed Holton and Richard A Swanson charting the advancements on these core principles. A third section includes selected readings from previous editions to illustrate the theory's evolution, as well as important articles from other key experts around the world for a comprehensive view. This new edition includes: * New chapter outlines, learning objectives and careful edits of Malcolm Knowles' work to simplify the original theory * Updates to the second part to reflect the very latest advancements in the field * Revisions throughout to make it more readable and relevant to your practices.

The objective of this article is to consider e-mentoring models applicable for SME staff development. The article examines a study conducted collaboratively between a university of applied sciences and entrepreneurial organisation, ascertaining organisation members' interest in e-mentoring for professional development. In this Finnish case, entrepreneurs' skill deficits and e-mentoring's possibilities as a learning support are identified, and the practicality and meaningfulness of different e-mentoring forms examined. The results indicate e-mentoring is expected to facilitate support from experienced entrepreneurs in practical professional development. Peer mentoring online was slightly preferred over one-on-one expert e-mentoring.
