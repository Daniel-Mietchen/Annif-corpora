Continuous deliveries, the topic of this thesis, cover the supply chain model of the case company Atea Finland Oy. The scope of the research is limited to the order-delivery chain, thus omitting supply chain processes after the point of delivery. There are two reasons for this delimitation. The scope of the whole project is too vast for the topic to be analyzed carefully in a Bachelor's thesis. The process of re-examining the supply chain model is ongoing and the areas that are analyzed in this thesis highlight this at this stage of the project. The objectives consist of describing the current state analysis of continuous deliveries, finding real life challenges from within the basic model, finding out whether the de-scription of the supply chain process model needs to be redesigned and, finally, reflect-ing on the findings against customer satisfaction. Conclusions consist of a list of challenges in the scope of the continuous deliveries that emerged from six interviews with the company personnel in key positions of the supply chain. In addition, the results are analyzed from research question perspectives. The list of challenges are gathered from sub-topic areas consisting of availability and requirements of mandatory information, responsibilities, internal information flow, information flow to customers and continuous development of the processes. As a result the challenges contribute to the development of the processes.

The aim of this Bachelor thesis was to prove the concept and the main solution for the electronic equipment 'wheel of fortune ' by applying an embedded system, an electric circuit design and a micro controller technology. The work was commissioned by firm Huvireppu Ay and started in January 2014. To achieve this aim it needed fully to understand how to build the basic electric circuit inside the equipment. The key feature of the project was to design a clockwise rotating wheel which was used in the project 'wheel of fortune ' as the most important part of this designing scheme. The design was implemented by using the embedded system technology. Using a microchip connected to the electric circuit controlling the running speed of the ‘wheel,’ and also can randomly stop the 'wheel' while doing the clockwise rotate. In the project work, two schemes were being used, and they have different principles and use different component, but they all achieve the same goal: The wheel does a clockwise rotate and randomly stops. Option one will use LEDs for the running of the wheel and using the 555 timer IC as a time delay chip, randomly slowing and lighting a group of LED lights that are used as the pointer of the wheel. Option two is using the mechanical solution; connecting the device to a stepper motor and using it as the pointer of the wheel and using the timer delay chip randomly stopping it as the pointer stop during the game time. Although the solution of this project was made, and the basic electric circuit diagram is complete, this practical design still carries a significant potential for future upgrading .It is still useful to those programmer adjusting and re coding the inner program of the microchip and applying to other similar electric device. To this 'wheel of fortune' electric equipment, more components can be added to perfect the additional function of the device.
