"The European Commission Recommendation on Collective Redress (2013/396/EU) establishes a framework to ensure a coherent horizontal approach to collective litigation in the EU context without harmonising national systems. The Commission clearly aims at distinguishing collective redress in Europe from the North American class action approach. This book explores the need for mass litigation mechanisms in Europe from a series of interdisciplinary perspectives. ... [It includes] commentary on various specific areas of collective redress including competition law, product liability and consumer protection; and the options for and relevance of collective ADR mechanisms."--Back cover.
