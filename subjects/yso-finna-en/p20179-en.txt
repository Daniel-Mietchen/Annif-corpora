This final thesis has been commissioned by Rautaruukki Oyj and the aim of the thesis is to study and estimate the potential market and clientele of Ruukki micropiles in Central European alpine countries, especially in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Additionally the purpose of this thesis is to collect relevant up to date information that can be possibly used later by Ruukki for the research and development of steel piles. The previously mentioned countries were chosen on the basis of the geological similarity of their alpine areas with Fenno-Nordic countries and the usage of ductile cast iron piles in these areas, which are similar to Ruukki's micropiles in structure and application. This thesis required the acquisition of information about, among other things, the geology, the design standards and the market situation of the aforementioned countries of interest. Additionally, information about the currently used pile systems in alpine countries was gathered, with special attention given to the previously mentioned ductile iron piles. The material presented in this thesis has been mostly gathered from the internet, such as the internet pages and brochures of various companies. Furthermore, some material was gathered by e-mail correspondence and by studying relevant literature. By utilizing the information collected for this thesis, a comprehensive comparison of the ductile cast iron piles and Ruukki micropiles was made and, based on this comparison and the gathered information, an estimation of Ruukki micropiles' market potential was able to be made. The market potential estimations and the appendices include price sensitive information and are thus classified.
