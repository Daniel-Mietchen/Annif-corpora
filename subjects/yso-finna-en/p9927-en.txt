"In this booklet ... the focus is on creating awareness and promoting rabbits, rodents and reptiles (the "3 Rs") as viable enterprises for small-scale farmers in rural, peri-urban and urban areas ... This booklet highlights the most important issues in the best use of small animals (rabbits, rodents and reptiles) in the expectation that development workers and policy-makers will recognize and act upon the numerous opportunities such small animals offer. This would not only result in improved livelihoods for producers but also assist in expanding employment and income opportunities in general. The booklet focus on important aspect of this business"--Introduction.

In 2005, some 1.4 billion people lived in absolute poverty and nearly 1 billion were affected by chronic mal- or undernutrition. An estimated 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas, and at least 600 million of these keep livestock that enable them to produce food, generate cash income, manage risks and build up assets. With the valuable contribution that livestock makes to sustaining livelihoods, especially in rural areas, the development of small-scale livestock enterprises could be a key element of efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Milk production is an important livestock-sector activity and it is estimated that nearly 150 million farm households throughout the world are engaged in milk production. Small-scale milk production not only improves food security of milk producing households but also creates significant amounts of employment in the entire dairy chain, which comprises many small-scale rural processors and intermediaries. The aim of this book is to provide a holistic picture on the trends and drivers in the dairy sector as well as the implications these may have for the future of dairy farming, in particular among the smaller-scale, rural producers.--Publisher's description.

Living on a few acres
The driving forces of income growth, demographic shifts, globalization and technical change have led to a reorganization of food systems from farm to plate. The characteristics of supply chains - particularly the role of supermarkets - linking farmers have changed, from consumption and retail to wholesale, processing, procurement and production. This book presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the impacts of changing agri-food systems on smallholder farmers, recognizing the importance of heterogeneity between developing countries as well as within them. The book includes a number of case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, which are used to illustrate differences in food systems' characteristics and trends. The country case studies explore impacts on the small farm sector across different countries, local contexts and farm types.--Publisher's description
The North Atlantic in the west and the Asian continent in the east regulate the general features of the climate in northern Finland. Especially in the low areas in the west, the smaller amounts of precipitation are largely due to the Scandic föhn effect. The weather conditions and microclimate in the fells differ from those in the lower areas. Temperature inversion is a common phenomenon on the slopes. Heavy snow loads in the crowns of the trees are a prominent feature of the southern fells and the eastern highlands.

"This paper reviews case studies on smallholder seed enterprises in Brazil, Côte d'Ivoire and India, as well as relevant world literature in order to identify key issues that facilitate or constrain the development of the seed factor. The final section provides some guidelines on policy design and implementation to promote the development of sustainable seed enterprises at different stages in the evolution of national seed factors. It provides examples of good practices and hence seeks to assist governments in identifying ways in which they can support the development of smallholder seed enterprises that will provide the most appropriate varieties to smallholder farmers in their efforts to boost food production."--Provided by publisher
