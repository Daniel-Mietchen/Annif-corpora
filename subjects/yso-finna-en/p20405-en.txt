Computers have changed not just the way we work but the way we love. Falling in and out of love, flirting, cheating, even having sex online have all become part of the modern way of living and loving. Yet we know very little about these new types of relationship. How is an online affair where the two people involved may never see or meet each other different from an affair in the real world? Is online sex still cheating on your partner? Why do people tell complete strangers their most intimate secrets? What are the rules of engagement? Will online affairs change the monogamous nature of romantic relationships? These are just some of the questions Professor Aaron Ben Ze'ev, distinguished writer and academic, addresses in this book, a full-length study of love online. Accessible, shocking, entertaining, enlightening, this book will change the way you look at cyberspace and love forever.

Kinsey goes online : an exploratory study on the variation of online sexual activity
Abstract: The main objective of this project was to evaluate EMI Finland's web site systematically by using best practices of the industry and also, by comparing the site to the most central competitors' and their subsidiaries' web sites. The first half of this study consists of three parts. The first part introduces web design and the purpose of web sites. The second part is the main section dealing with theory covered in this project. This main section explains best practices used in web design. The third part summarizes the established best practices via a web design evaluation tool that is used to analyze the music industry web sites chosen for this project. The second half of this study is the practical part. In this section the evaluation tool is used to systematically evaluate ten music industry web sites including EMI Finland's web site. Each web site is first evaluated individually and then brought together in a large comparison matrix. Conclusions are made by analyzing this comparison matrix and the  individual evaluations. These conclusions are then used to make a proposition for EMI Music Finland on what should be developed on their web site. The key findings of this project were that EMI Finland web site is a little above average when compared to other web sites in the industry. Three major issues found on the EMI web site are poor social media integration, lack of quality management regarding content, and lack of captivating features. These issues are carefully considered in the practical part. Guidance on how to how to tackle these issues is given in the propositions section. This project was conducted with support provided by Thomas Rohweder from Metropolia, and Nora Norrlin, the marketing manager for EMI.

This case was based on a PhD project carried out at Sao Paulo University, Brazil. The central idea was to identify the opinions of several stakeholders in clinical research about a hot topic in bioethics, namely, post-trial access to medication used in studies of pharmaceuticals. In order to include different groups as well as representatives from throughout Brazilian territory, we decided to perform the survey through the Internet. Despite limitations inherent to an Internet survey, this study shows that e-surveys can be a reliable and useful tool, compared with the classical ways of doing academic research (by phone, mail, or face-to-face interviews).

Maria Bakardjieva investigates Internet use and its implications for society through insights into the daily experiences of ordinary users. She also examines how people interpret domesticate and creatively appropriate the Internet.
Through either direct exposure or media coverage of the online world, consumers have built certain expectations around interactivity. Activities like email, chat, and web browsing reinforce popular understanding how people use electronic devices to 'talk', 'find' and 'see' what's happening in the world around them. Reaching The Interactive Customer describes how these consumer expectations of interactivity impact and shape the new generations of 'connected' personal electronics. Reaching the Interactive Customer provides critical information for business professionals who want to understand a 'connected world', linking businesses, customers, and service providers. It describes how the audience for interactive services has evolved and what that audience is looking for in consumer devices. This book also appeals to anyone who works on or is interested in Web-based technology because it paints a clear picture of how interactivity is evolving from the Internet to the next generation of interactivity with phones and televisions.

The ICT sector is crucial as a driver of economic and social growth. Not only is it an important industry in its own right, but it also provides the communication and infrastructure without which modern economies could not function. How does this sector work? Why is it stronger in some countries than in others? What should companies, governments and regulators be doing to enhance its contribution? In The New ICT Ecosystem, Martin Fransman answers these and other questions by developing the idea of the ICT sector as an evolving ecosystem. He shows that some components of the ICT ecosystem, particularly the innovation process, work better in some countries and regions than in others. For example, the Internet content and applications layer of the ecosystem tends to work better in the US than in Europe or Asia. The analysis in this book enables policy makers and regulators to understand why some parts of the ICT ecosystem are underperforming and what can be done to enhance their performance. The previous edition of The New ICT Ecosystem won the 2008â10 Joseph Schumpeter Prize.

The field of educational research lacks a methodology for the study of learning that does not begin with humans, their aims, and their interests. The Materiality of Learning seeks to overcome this human-centered mentality by developing a novel spatial approach to the materiality of learning. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), Estrid SÃ¸rensen compares an Internet-based 3D virtual environment project in a fourth-grade class with the class's work with traditional learning materials, including blackboards, textbooks, notebooks, pencils, and rulers. Taking into account pupils' and teachers' physical bodies, Professor SÃ¸rensen analyzes the multiple forms of technology, knowledge, and presence that are enacted with the materials. Featuring detailed ethnographic descriptions and useful end-of-chapter summaries, this book is an important reference for professionals and graduate or postgraduate students interested in a variety of fields, including educational studies, educational psychology, social anthropology, and STS.

Love Online : Emotions on the Internet
The Internet 1997 unleashed
In recent years, the Internet has come to dominate our lives. E-mail, instant messaging and chat are rapidly replacing conventional forms of correspondence, and the Web has become the first port of call for both information enquiry and leisure activity. How is this affecting language? There is a widespread view that as 'technospeak' comes to rule, standards will be lost. In this book, David Crystal argues the reverse: that the Internet has encouraged a dramatic expansion in the variety and creativity of language. Covering a range of Internet genres, including e-mail, chat, and the Web, this is a revealing account of how the Internet is radically changing the way we use language. This second edition has been thoroughly updated to account for more recent phenomena, with a brand new chapter on blogging and instant messaging. Engaging and accessible, it will continue to fascinate anyone who has ever used the Internet.
