In "Design for Services", Anna Meroni and Daniela Sangiorgi articulate what Design is doing and can do for services, and how this connects to existing fields of knowledge and practice. Designers previously saw their task as the conceptualisation, development and production of tangible objects. In the twenty-first century, a designer rarely 'designs something' but rather 'designs for something': in the case of this publication, for change, better experiences and better services. The authors reflect on this recent transformation in the practice, role and skills of designers, by organising their book into three main sections. The first section links "Design for Services" to existing models and studies on services and service innovation. Section two presents multiple service design projects to illustrate and clarify the issues, practices and theories that characterise the discipline today; using these case studies the authors propose a conceptual framework that maps and describes the role of designers in the service economy. The final section projects the discipline into the emerging paradigms of a new economy to initiate a reflection on its future development.

Services are key activities in a globalized economy and they also underlie the quality of life of local residents. The advanced work presented in this book was selected from the proceedings of the Third International Conference on Serviceology (ICServ2015), held July 7-9, 2015, in San Jose, CA, USA. The conference was supported by the Society for Serviceology. The society was established in 2012 in Japan to explore the scientific systematization of services and to promote technological developments for solutions to industrial issues. This book provides a useful general guide to the state of the art in the theory and practice of services. It can also serve as a valuable reference book for researchers in a wide range of fields from engineering to marketing and economics.
