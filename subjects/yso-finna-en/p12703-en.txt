Since its launch in 1998 by the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program has become the standard measure of sustainability for buildings worldwide. Successfully reaching one of four LEED certification levels- Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum- requires specific point totals, which differ among building types. Getting certified, in addition to altruistic benefits, allows building owners to take advantage of a growing number of state and local government incentives. The menu of potential points available for various practices ranges from installing bike racks on-site to documenting the source of the iron ore used in any construction steel. An architect's knowledge of materials can make or break a building's rating. With a little insider knowledge, you can also use one material to get credit in two, three, or even more areas. LEED Materials is packed with critical information on nearly two hundred materials, products, and services. Organized in the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat, this highly visual guide makes sure your material choices and uses will maximize your LEED credits. Includes a foreword by Steven Winter, former chairman of the U.S. Green Building Council.
