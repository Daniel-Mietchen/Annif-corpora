"Evidence-based education is an attempt to find, critique and implement the highest quality research evidence that underpins the education provided to students. This comprehensive book presents concepts key to evidence-based education, learning and teaching, analysing a wide range of allied health professions in depth. It introduces unique, inspirational practice models, ideal for practical application, and highlights ways in which healthcare educators can make use of existing education-related research to improve their teaching and also generate learning environments to promote optimal student experiences. Whilst fostering knowledge and understanding between various health professions, it also improves student outcomes and increases student satisfaction. This edited text is an invaluable resource for healthcare professionals along with experienced clinical and university-based educators such as practice education supervisors, academic educators, educational researchers and doctoral students in a range of areas including nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, radiography, occupational therapy, speech therapy, audiology, paramedics, nutrition and dietetics, and pharmacy who want to ensure their teaching and learning strategies are underpinned by sound empirical evidence." --

Reflective practice in nursing
The convergence of two complementary agendas motivated collaboration between two universities (in Zambia and Finland) to establish the Centre for the Promotion of Literacy in Sub-Saharan Africa (CAPOLSA), focused on initial literacy learning in indigenous languages. The project's mandate and activities are closely related to Zambia's national context of literacy and educational provision, emerging trends in information and communication technology, and the University of Zambia's institutional context of research and development on literacy, child development, and education. CAPOLSA has afforded opportunities for enhancing the working relations between the national university and government and for contributing to the development of institutional linkages and consultative forums. Collaboration between various disciplines, institutions, and economic sectors characterizes CAPOLSA's activities. Important areas of progress envisaged include institutional development, growth of a sustainable community of researchers whose collective efforts will increase the scale of Africa's contribution to international knowledge, and evidence-based planning at the interface between humans and technology.
This book is a collection of papers presented in the Finnish Educational Research Association Conference on Education FERA 2013, which was held in University of Jyväskylä in November 21-22, 2013. The title of the book, Enabling Education, encompasses the conference theme − Education for future well-being and teaching excellence. The word Education has purposefully been written with a capital letter in the book title. Education with a big E is something which initiates us into the kinds of practices that foster the good life for each person and the good for humankind. The capital letter implies that Education with a big E is something more than schooling which has transformed education into standardized, factory-like practices. As the keynote speaker of the conference Stephen Kemmis puts it: ”Schooling is to produce people with skills for production and the means for consumption, and people who are willing providers and grateful clients of services. (…) Education, by contrast, is a process of individual and collective self-formation, a simultaneous process of growing good selves and good societies.” Education with a big E is not limited to conventional school-based settings. It happens in everyday life, and it is a life-long journey. It may take place outdoors and through adventures as well as in peoples��� homes, on trains and streets via portable electronic devices. It may be about cultural education − music, arts, and crafts as well as literature, video clips, and digital stories. Education requires inter-professional collaboration and presupposes the strong agency of the educators. Education is something very practical and simultaneously deeply philosophical and ethical. The eleven chapters of this book shed light on all these aspects of Education with a big E.
