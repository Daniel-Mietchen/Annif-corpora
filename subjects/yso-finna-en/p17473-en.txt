"Between 1947 and 1959 a post-war generation of modern architects laid a series of challenges and critiques of the methods of modern architecture and town planning to the founding members of CIAM (Congress of International Modern Architecture). The proposals by the newer members for an alternate approach brought about the end of this prominent institution and resulted in the loose association of international architects known as Team 10.This book tells the story underlying the tale of Team 10 as it was told by CIAM and Team 10 members, and historians. Offered here is a theoretical framework for understanding the diverse practices of post-war architecture and town planning, but also a critical and historical framework for understanding contemporary practice.
