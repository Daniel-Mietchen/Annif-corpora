Concurrent Programming in ML focuses on the practical use of concurrency to implement naturally concurrent applications. In addition to a tutorial introduction to programming in Concurrent ML (CML), the book presents three extended examples using CML for practical systems programming: a parallel software build system, a simple concurrent window manager, and an implementation of distributed tuple spaces. CML, which is included as part of the SML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) distribution, combines the best features of concurrent programming and functional programming. This book also illustrates advanced SML programming techniques, and includes a chapter on the implementation of concurrency using features provided by the SML/NJ system. It will be of interest to programmers, students, and professional researchers working in computer language development.
