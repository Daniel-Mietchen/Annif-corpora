"This book is the first of its kind to collectively address design-based and mechanical micro-manufacturing topics in one place. It focuses on design and materials selection, as well as the manufacturing of micro-products using mechanical-based micro-manufacturing process technologies. After addressing the fundamentals and non-metallic-based micro-manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry, it goes on to address specific metallic-based micro-manufacturing processes, such as: micro-forming, micro-machining, micro-molding, micro-laser processing, micro-layered manufacturing, micro-joining, micro-assembly and materials handling, and microEDM and ECM"--

Nanotechnology : principles and practices
"β-barrel outer membrane channel proteins (OMP) have great potential as robust and flexible models or components in nanotechnology. Over the last decade biotechnological techniques allowed to expand the natural characteristics of OMPs by modifying their geometry and properties without affecting the overall protein structure and stability. The present book is oriented towards a broad group of readers including graduate students and advanced researchers. The β-barrel structure serviceability for the nano-material design will be its chief topic giving a general introduction to the field of OMP based nano-component development as well as the state of the art of the involved research. On the example of the E. coli FhuA the transformation of an OMP into a tailored nano-channel to be adapted to a non-biological synthetic (i.e. polymer) environment, rendering it competitive with artificial non-biological nano-pores will be outlined specifically the design of a set of protein nano-channels with tailored geometry (diameter, length), conductance and functionality will be reported as a case study. In order to make this book a valuable source of information for both biotechnologists and other scientists interested in bio-nanotechnology an overview of the different steps involved in the nano-channel protein design and production will be reported. The scientific strategy from concept design, theoretical considerations, genetic engineering and large scale production, to system assembly and biophysical characterization with an overview on technological applications including membrane/polymersome technology, will be described." -- (Back Cover)

Polymer-carbon nanotube composites : preparation, properties and applications
The rapidly developing field of nanomaterials has expanded in many commercial areas. More recent studies have begun to provide a foundation for understanding how nanomaterials influence cells and how they also can serve as methodological tools for studies in medicine and cell biology, include research into stem cells. Recent investigations have shown affects of nanomaterials on specific subcellular structures, such as the actin-based brush border network in cells with an increasing emphasis on the barrier function of epithelial tissues. While other studies have shown involvement of nanoparticles in specific cytoplasmic signal transduction events such as the rise in intracellular free calcium, a signaling event known to regulate many changes in cell architecture and function. In parallel, nanomaterials are increasingly used in medicine for drug delivery, treatment of cancer, and an increasing number of new applications. This book investigates these areas and also includes new methods for assessment in cell biology and medicine.

While many books are dedicated to individual aspects of nanofabrication, there is no single source that defines and explains the total vision of the field. Filling this gap, Nanofabrication Handbook presents a unique collection of new and the most important established approaches to nanofabrication. Contributors from leading research facilities and academic institutions around the world define subfields, offer practical instructions and examples, and pave the way for future research. Helping readers to select the proper fabricating technique for their experiments, the book provides a broad vision of the most critical problems and explains how to solve them. It includes basic definitions and introduces the main underlying concepts of nanofabrication. The book also discusses the major advantages and disadvantages of each approach and offers a wide variety of examples of cutting-edge applications. Each chapter focuses on a particular method or aspect of study. For every method, the contributors describe the underlying theoretical basis, resolution, patterns and substrates used, and applications. They show how applications at the nanoscale require a different process and understanding than those at the microscale. For each experiment, they elucidate key solutions to problems relating to materials, methods, and surface considerations. A complete resource for this rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field, this handbook provides practical information for planning the experiments of any project that employs nanofabrication techniques. It gives readers a foundation to enter the complex world of nanofabrication and inspires the scientific community at large to push the limits of nanometer resolution.
