Effect of accelerating admixture on early strength development of concrete
Concrete structures: stresses and deformations
Accelerating admixtures shorten the time of setting and increase the rate of early strength development of concrete. The aim of this thesis was to study the possibilities of using new accelerating admixtures in precast concrete production. A series of tests were performed in a laboratory in order to find out the effect of accelerators on workability, heat generation and strength development of concrete. Tests were done with no-slump concrete and self-compacting concrete. The binders used in the tests were type CEM I Portland cements. One of these is in common use in Finnish production plants. The tests were carried out with an accelerator dosage at around the average of the preferred use range. Based on the results, accelerators are most beneficial in enhancing the production rate of elements that are difficult to heat after casting. Of the five accelerators tested, one improved the early strength development clearly more than the others. It is recommended that this accelerator is used as the reference when accelerating admixtures are evaluated.

One of the ways of keeping the environment clean and safe is by avoiding unnecessary waste and saving the space for small and large scale development practices. Recycled aggregates are one of those recycled construction materials that are used to mitigate the material consuming, money intensive, and environmentally alarming construction market. In this small study recycled aggregate materials were acquired from Top-Mix, recycling plant for construction and demolition waste that recycles this rubble into recycled aggregates. These recycled aggregates are often used in road constructions. To stimulate the use of recycled aggregates in structural applications; it should be proven that these kinds of aggregates are not harmful to the application. In this study the aim was to determine if recycled aggregates contain certain contaminations that can disturb the binding reactions of cement, especially chlorides and sulfates. The investigation consisted of several steps; Visual inspection, determination of the content of concrete, red bricks, woods and other materials. Dividing into different aggregate size groups and determination of; the water absorption, chemical chloride content and water soluble sulfate content were done.  The result on the chemical analysis showed that there is no chemical danger from recycling the construction aggregates, as the concentrations of both chloride and did not go beyond the limit for use in construction applications.

Beton brut or 'Raw concrete' was a term coined by Le Corbusier and appropriated by two young British architects in the 1950s to describe a new kind of building: austere, unadorned, monolithic, confrontational and constructed almost entirely in concrete. Brutalist architecture blossomed in Britain in the second half of the twentieth century, with planners favouring its functionality and low costs for social housing projects, government buildings and shopping centres. But as the school spread, so its reputation foundered, with Brutalism quickly becoming synonymous with crime, economic deprivation and inner-city decay. In the twenty-first century, Brutalist buildings are just as prominent, and just as pilloried - seen by many as 'spiky survivors of the sixties'. But there is another side to Brutalism, one of artistic vision, political idealism and painstaking attention to detail: a school of architecture to celebrate, not destroy. 'Raw concrete' provides a groundbreaking history of the heavy-concrete architecture of post-war Britain, as well as a personal and illuminating guide to eight pivotal Brutalist buildings. Beginning in a tiny concrete hermitage on the remote north Scottish coast, and ending up backstage at the National Theatre, 'Raw concrete' takes us on a wide-ranging journey through Britain over the past sixty years, stopping to examine how these buildings were made - from commission to construction - why they have been so hated, and why they should be loved.

"As an architect, you want to integrate the best building envelope construction methods, materials science, and structural principles in your work, but you need a resource to help you. With more than seventy significant case studies located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia from prehistory to the present, this book illuminates the theory and techniques of assembling exteriors. Six chapters organized by wall types, from hand-set monolithic walls to digitally fabricated curtain walls, each have a material focus section to help you understand their intrinsic properties so that you can decide which will best keep the weather out of your building. Case studies include: Great Wall, China Israeli Supreme Court Building, Jerusalem, Ram Karmi and Ada Karmi-Melamed Fďřation Nationale du Bt́iments, Paris, Jean Prouv Ǐnstitut du Monde Arabe, Paris, Jean Nouvel Morgan Library, New York City, Renzo Piano Katsura Imperial Villa, Kyoto Sainsbury Center for Visual Arts, Norwich, UK, Sir Norman Foster"--

Packed with case studies highlighting construction companies that regularly recycle between 70% and 95% of concrete from their waste streams, this book presents practical, up-to-date information about concrete's history in the green building movement, state of the art methodologies, and current best practices. Using the USGBC LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building assessment standard, the book covers site, energy, water, materials, indoor environmental quality, construction, and demolition waste protocols and provides information on tracking the LEED requirements to assure timely building certification. It also addresses non-LEED issues, such as flo od and fire protection benefits.
