voyeurism
Theatre as Voyeurism (re)defines voyeurism as an 'exchange' between performers and audience members, privileging pleasure (erotic and aesthetic) as a crucial factor in contemporary theatre.
Theatre as voyeurism : the pleasures of watching
From out of the city
Alone with her
Peepholes
Jason : an Anita Blake, vampire hunter novel
Abandon the old in Tokyo
To steal her love
Exposed : voyerism, surveillance, and the camera since 1870
