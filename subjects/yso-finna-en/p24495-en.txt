"The 'Europeanisation' of the fight against crime is a broad and much-contested notion. This in-depth analysis of the role of the EU in fighting crime within the area of freedom, security and justice explores the impact of EU policies in the Member States, the progressive convergence of Member States' criminal law systems, the emergence of mutual recognition as an alternative to harmonization, and the incremental development of the ECJ's jurisdiction. The essays also explore the limitations inherent in EU counter-crime policies and the changes brought about by the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. These changes are discussed both collectively and within individual substantive areas in which the EU has taken an active role in fighting crime, such as corruption, money laundering, terrorism, organised crime and extradition"--

"Since the 1970s, various sociological approaches have tried to understand and conceptualize "the global," yet few of them have systematically addressed the full spectrum of social relationships. Prominent exponents of the global approach - such as world systems analysis - instead have focused on particular domains such as politics or the economy. Under the label of "world society," however, some authors have suggested alternatives to the predominant equivocation of society and the nation-state. The contributions to this volume share that objective and take their point of departure from the two most ambitious projects of a theory of world society: world polity research and systems theory, mapping out the common ground and assessing their potential to inform empirical analyses of globalization"--

The OECD DAC handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) : supporting security and justice
The central proposition of this book is that the United States of America is the dominant pole in the new world order, and that the world is still living in an American Age, which in the author's opinion will likely endure for a long time to come (at least five decades). There are indications to support this proposition, in particular the fact that the power structure in the unipolar world order tilts clearly in favor of the United States of America and its power and influence in the military, economic, cultural, educational, energy and transport fields. For example, the US defense budget exceeds the total combined defense budgets of the six next largest defense spenders.
