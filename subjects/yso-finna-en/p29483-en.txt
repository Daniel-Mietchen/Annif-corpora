This volume gives a survey of the most recent developments and trends in intergroup research. Diverging from classical approaches that looked at diverse needs and motives (positive distinctiveness, belongingness, etc), the present book focuses not only on the question what motivates intergroup behaviour, but especially on how the motivation of intergroup behavior functions. The book focuses on the role of emotion and motivation in the development of intergroup conflict, social exclusion, tolerance and other group related phenomena. The first section demonstrates how classical theories in the field have been further developed, enriched, and more sophisticatedly tested over the years. The second section summarises research on affect and memory and develops a group based self-regulation approach. The third section examines several specific emotions as motivational forces of intergroup behaviour, and the fourth section looks at factors of intergroup relations that lead to social change, and details the implementations and evaluations of intergroup tolerance programs. The chapters are short and easy-to-comprehend summaries referring to a broad range of original work. "Intergroup Relations: The Role of Motivation and Emotion" is therefore a useful resource for advanced students of Social Psychology and researchers in the field of intergroup relations in general.
