JNK signaling and induction of mitosis in wound healing in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster
The Drosophila JNK signaling pathway regulates epithelial cell shape changes during the process of dorsal closure in embryogenesis. Due to mutations in the JNK signaling pathway, the elongation process in the lateral and leading edge cells is disrupted.  Severe morphological defects, including cleft thorax, on the thorax occur in the mutated adult flies. The purpose of this thesis was to study the effect of mitochondrial catalase (mtCAT) on cleft thorax in Drosophila melanogaster. The primary goal was to find out whether the effect of mtCAT can mimic the effect of AOX in terms of rescuing the cleft thorax phenotype. The research method was based on the crossing of flies that carries UAS promoter linked with the GAL4-pnrMD237 with the flies containing RNAi constructs against JNK signaling pathway genes. The results showed that mtCAT can mimic AOX effect on cleft thorax when some of the JNK pathway genes are silenced in the dorsal epithelium. A minor mtCAT rescue effect on the dorsal midline was found after hep knockdown and major rescue after jun knockdown. Similar rescue effect was not observed in kay and msn knockdown. Subsequent research is required to clarify the role of mtCAT in rescue.

Ornamental bananes : notes on the section Rhodochlamys (Musaceae)
This paper examines the vertical price transmission of banana and orange prices in Finland using import and consumer price series from years 1998-2009. Considering the stationary behaviour of the price series, the dynamic relationship between import and consumer price is investigated by Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL) models and Error Correction Models (ECM). The results show that the vertical price transmission is symmetric both with banana and orange. However, the analysis concentrates on the speed of adjustment towards the equilibrium of prices. Due to linearity of the model it does not take into account the magnitude of the price change.
