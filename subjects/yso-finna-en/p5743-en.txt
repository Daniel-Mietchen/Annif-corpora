The objective was to take Anritsu Bluetooth Test Set MT8852A/ MT8850A in use and develop some meaningful exercises for the performance study of Bluetooth devices. This thesis was initially designed by Mr. Veijo Korhonen, Senior Lecturer, School of Engineering and Natural Resources, Oulu University of Applied Sciences, Finland and originally this project was planned for Nokia. To attain the performance measurements, we selected some test devices, from different manufacturers and different packages (EUT) and used Anritsu Bluetooth Test Set MT8852A and MT8850A together with BlueSuite Professional Software, BlueTest, LabView to find the characteristics of the devices in different test scenario and finally to analyze the performance with a graphical representation. The work involved studying the device theory and working out the principle of Bluetooth Test Set (Anritsu MT8852A/ MT8850A) and making it functional, developing a test setup and taking care of measurements using BlueSuite/LabView software analysis, verification of software simulation results and fine tuning of the test setup model according to the measurement results for better representation and finally demonstrating the characteristics found in Bluetooth EUTs and Bluetooth Test Set. The test results can be used for any further research about the characteristics of EUT’s and the performance of Bluetooth (RF performance) in indoor environments. The performance is mainly evaluated with a graphical representation of the EUT’s transmitting power quality, the demodulated received signal quality for different data packets and sizes, frequency deviation of the EUT’s transmitter. It is also possible to extend the analysis with some additional software and hardware tools to make a further study of the packet data flow by making a statistical analysis to find the behavior of the EUT’s with the change of distance, measuring the throughput and efficiency for different packet sizes and explore the security features and behavior of EUT’s in different network environment.
