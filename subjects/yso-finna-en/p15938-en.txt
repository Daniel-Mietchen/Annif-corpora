"The extensively revised and updated 6th edition of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) textbook and accompanying DVD-ROM are designed in accord with the program's curriculum changes and sharpened focus on active, hands-on learning. The text facilitates the newly recommended self-paced learning approach. Self-study is optimized to help students prepare for the mandatory online examination that replaces the traditional written test. It also complements the simulations and case-based sceanarios at the heart of the new NRP. Content updates thoughout the text and DVD-ROM reflect the 2010 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)/American Heart Association Guidelines for Neonatal Resuscitation. Must-know new material includes the latest recommendations across key areas of change including: Revisions in the NRP flow diagram; elimination of evaluation of amniotic fluid in initial rapid assessment; use of supplemental oxygen during neonatal resuscitation; use of pulse oximetry; chest compression procedures. The book includes a companion DVD-ROM (for use on both PC and Mac), bringing a higher level of interactivity to the learning process. Active learning features on the DVD include multi-decision point scenarios and randomly generated clinical problems and outcomes"--P. 4 of cover.

"The improved survival of very preterm and very low birth weight infants in recent decades has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of physical and neurodevelopmental problems. Attention is increasingly being focused on the quality of life of survivors, who are at greater risk of brain damage and consequent neurological disorders, and neuropsychological and behavioural impairments. In this volume, leading experts present a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on research in various aspects of the long-term consequences of very preterm birth. As well as extending existing knowledge of the neurodevelopmental sequelae following very preterm birth, a shared aim of this burgeoning body of research is to identify the mechanisms underlying variations in outcome, and thus recognise subgroups of children who are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems, for whom appropriate intervention strategies can be devised. Pediatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists will all find this to be essential reading"--Provided by publisher.
