The Harakka artist' colony
Since the late thirteenth century, the glass of Murano, manufactured by master artisans on the Venetian archipelago of that name, has been collected voraciously by connoisseurs, royalty and museums worldwide. Murano's glassmakers invented and defined so many of the craft's best-known effects - crystalline, enameled, gold-threaded, multicolored and milk glass - that it is impossible to conceive of it without their labors." "Today's Murano craftsmen still use these ancient techniques, and in this photographic study, photographer Henry Thoreau takes us behind the scenes to offer a peek at their studios, factories and showrooms. Happily, his images are not at all of the gift shop brochure stripe, for they document not only the racks and trays of exquisite glassware, the workshops, furnaces, etc., but also their more lived-in recesses, giving the reader a palpable whiff of a working atmosphere. Thoreau's eye is matter-of-fact, characterized by a strong perspectival detachment and an unwillingness to overplay the obvious appeal of these intriguing studios, which speak for themselves of the wonders that are wrought there / WorldCat.

Work that used be tied to offices, cubicles and desks is undergoing a major transformation in terms of where, when and how it is carried out. Space and materiality of workplaces have long been taken for granted amongst organization studies scholars. But the changing definition of work and workspace has, in recent years, inspired a growing number of scholars to reconsider organizational theories and practices. By combining new research on leadership and workspaces, Leadership in Spaces and Places argues for a radical reconceptualization of leadership. Leadership is not only defined by leaders themselves, but is also affected by the built environment. With contributions from both scholars and practitioners alike, the authors discuss leadership in six different contexts:  workspaces in change,  open office spaces, virtual workspaces,  service spaces,  cultural spaces,  institutional spaces. The book is aimed at two audiences: leadership, organization and management scholars interested in cutting-edge leadership research; and managers, architects and workplace designers who want to update their knowledge on how workplace design contributes to organizational purposes and leadership.

The Finnish economy is returning to growth. Economic data have strengthened, and leading indicators suggest growth continuing through the forecast years. However, this growth is entirely dependent on domestic demand, and net exports remain weak. The Finnish economy is still lagging behind activity in the rest of the euro area, and real GDP will not recover its pre-financial crisis level even by the end of the forecast period. Meanwhile, the increasing role of the service sector in the economy slows productivity growth and the decline in the working-age population also dampens longer-term prospects. The Bank of Finland forecast foresees 1.1% GDP growth in 2016. The economy will continue to grow by 1.1% in 2017 and 1.0% in 2018..
