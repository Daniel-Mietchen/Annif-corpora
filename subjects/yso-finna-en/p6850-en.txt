Introductory functional analysis with applications
This book introduces functional analysis at an elementary level without assuming any background in real analysis, for example on metric spaces or Lebesgue integration. It focuses on concepts and methods relevant in applied contexts such as variational methods on Hilbert spaces, Neumann series, eigenvalue expansions for compact self-adjoint operators, weak differentiation and Sobolev spaces on intervals, and model applications to differential and integral equations. Beyond that, the final chapters on the uniform boundedness theorem, the open mapping theorem and the Hahn-Banach theorem provide a stepping-stone to more advanced texts. Many examples illustrate the new notions and results. Each chapter concludes with a large collection of exercises, some of which are referred to in the margin of the text, tailor-made in order to guide the student digesting the new material. Optional sections and chapters supplement the mandatory parts and allow for modular teaching spanning from basic to honors track level.

The goal of this work is to present the principles of functional analysis in a clear and concise way. The first three chapters of Functional Analysis: Fundamentals and Applications describe the general notions of distance, integral and norm, as well as their relations. The three chapters that follow deal with fundamental examples: Lebesgue spaces, dual spaces and Sobolev spaces. Two subsequent chapters develop applications to capacity theory and elliptic problems. In particular, the isoperimetric inequality and the Pólya-Szegő and Faber-Krahn inequalities are proved by purely functional methods. The epilogue contains a sketch of the history of functional analysis, in relation with integration and differentiation.
