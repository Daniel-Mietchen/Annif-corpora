This thesis is done for Oulu University of Applied Sciences (OUAS) School of Business and Information Management. The main objective of the thesis is to implement a software installation system for OpixManager that supports local and remote server installation. At moment new users may need to do the manual installation before execution. Database creation and configuration have to be done by hand based on the tutorial that is available on OpixProject website. However, the manual installation process is not convenient for end users. Therefore, an automatic system is to be developed to enable simple and quick installation for users. In addition, the personal goal of this thesis is to learn how to implement the installation system for open-source software and new web development technologies. This research covers the knowledge base and development of installation system for Opix-Manager. Primarily, concepts of web application installation procedures and usability are studied before the implementation. Installation process and technology behind the OpixManager needs to be revised in order to develop an installation system. In addition, other installation systems like Wordpress will be studied to get ideas for implementation. The practical part will focus on implementing a tool for OpixManager to perform the installation process with simple and friendly web-based user interface, which can fulfill requirements of the commissioner.

Studying user strategies and characteristics for developing web search interfaces
"How do we design for users? How might users best participate in the design process? How can we evaluate the user's experience of designed products and services? These fundamental questions are addressed in Designers, Users, and Justice, through a series of dialogues between a design scholar and a designer. In a series of conversations, the scholar and the designer address the concepts and practice of user centred design, examining whether a 'just method' necessarily leads to a just design, consider different models for understanding user experience and socially productive design, including the capability approach and utilitarianism, and ponder how an ethical framework for evaluating design might be developed. Throughout, the scholar and the designer draw on their particular experiences in design practice and design education, and propose alternative conceptualisations of the key ideas of user centred design, highlighting and seeking to address the ethical shortcomings of mainstream user centred design practice"--
In this thesis some theory of Usability is first explained to give a context to the readers about the tests that took place afterwards. Far from being a complete study of Usability, the work focus on some general components of Usability for then going to explain the principles of Usability Testing that were used in the test, specifically the Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic Evaluation methods. The readers, now armed with this knowledge of usability, can understand and appreciate better the test plans for the Usability Testing that took place on 16th of December 2010 at Haaga-Helia UAS. Two tests were conducted: a Cognitive Walkthrough and an Heuristic Evaluation of 3 commercial DBMS products and the support web sites linked to them. The tests were quite succesful and produced copious amount of data that was used to generate some reccomendations about the products. The recommendations are too extensive to reproduce here, but each of the products had its strong and weak points, some more than others. Beside a series of recommendations, there is also a series of feedback received during the test and the experiences of the test moderator that are reproduced in the text to help future students in preparing and conducting better tests. Once again, listing all the findings would not fit in this abstract, but the hope here is that they will help quite much any student or researcher going this same route.

Usability testing of Sauraha website
This Master’s thesis concentrates on a particular tool, called Äly Excel, which is used in health care centres in Finland. The Äly Excel is a Microsoft Excel based tool that helps to plan a health care personnel rota. The main goal of this work was to enhance usability of the Äly Excel. The development work was part of the Hyvä Potku project that is managed by Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District. To find out the most important usability problems of the Äly Excel, usability tests were carried out in an early phase of the project work. Also, a questionnaire was sent out to gather user experience and possible suggestions for improvements. Once the feedback and user test observations were analysed and agreed with the Hyvä Potku project members, the development of the Äly Excel began. Since the Äly Excel is a Microsoft Excel based worksheet, it was natural to choose Visual Basic as a programming language as Visual Basic Application is part of the Microsoft Office package. New UI features are designed so that they follow well-known usability studies. In this thesis a usability theory is observed and discussed. The thesis details the software and UI design and why certain decisions were made. The problems faced during the development work are explained. At the end there is a discussion about the future development of the Äly Excel.

This thesis goes through the process of creating a graphic design of a web page which includes determining all the components and how they can affect the visual outcome. The main task is to create a design plan for a website by creating images with an image editing software with the support of theoretical knowledge, end users’ preferences, and creativity. The aim is to create a modern design considering the responsive functions and the users’ needs. The users’ perspectives, needs, and habits are explored by interviewing companies supplied by the commissioner. The theoretical research contributes technical guidance on making choices in the design of a web page. The designs were made with Adobe Photoshop, which was accessible at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences, as was the recorder used in the interviews. The images in the designs were chosen from the commissioner’s existing website. The colours used in the designs were designated with the help of a colour wheel application. This thesis may be used by the commissioner for their webpage as well as anyone who is working with visual designs and looking for some theoretical explanations. The information covers many aspects of design as a webpage is a whole consisting of many components, such as text, layouts, and various types of graphics.

This piece of work is on the comparing the usability of the old and the new websites of our school - Turku University of Applied Science (Sepankatu library). The school uses two different tools to build the sites and each tool has both disadvantages and advantages respectively. These issues as well as others issues are inspected in this work and a conclusion are drawn from there in based on what is observed. A defined guide lines are followed to do the comparisons and they are presented here. There are many ways of doing usability testing of a piece of software product. In this work, the measurement is performed by means of inquiries and a bit of inspection is used. The measurement by testing is not performed at all since it is not feasible for this project. These measurement metrics are carried out with the involvement of many students in the school, through giving their opinions expressed on forms provided to them. These questionnaires are carefully crafted to involve quality attributes of software and at the same time will not take the time of the people filling it up. From the results obtained plus subjective opinion of the author, the conclusion is drawn. This document is divided as follows: chapter two looks at software, aspects of software, quality attributes of software, software quality metrics, and how to measure these metrics. Chapter three discusses one of quality attributes of software that is usability. This topic is picked and elaborated in this chapter since the project is based on this quality attribute of software and it is the fundamental. Chapter four discusses the websites of the school and inspections carried out on the two sites. Chapter five is dedicated to the evaluation of the websites and chapter six gives the conclusion based on the chapters four and five respectively.

The aim of this thesis was to improve the quality of the website, to increase the efficiency, productivity, user friendliness as well as minimize the number of errors encountered by the users while navigating the site. Making the website easier to use benefits the company to know which parts customers would select the most. The owner of the company would be able to redesign their website, add new features to target certain customers, edit an unclear or confusing feature and get information on a lacking content or features from the users. The test was done according to the Thinking Aloud test method and to collect and analyze the results, five different individuals having some technical knowledge were participated in the usability test. The participants were tested in a different time schedule in a well managed testing room. All the tasks done by the participants were recorded by the Morae Software during the test and this software was totally invisible to the test participants. It helped to find out the most lacking areas and whether the test users have the same type of usability problems on the website or not. After the usability test was completed, the results were analysed and compiled into a report, which contains actionable recommendations for fixing the observed issues from the test users with the website. Although the website was easy to use, user friendly and had some problems, the prototype visual version of the redesigned website was made and handed to the client.

Intergration of Information System Models by Using Layers and Elision
Purpose of this master's thesis was to discover and identify key points how underground loader operator environments could be improved. New definition for pleasurable cabin was created during the discovery phase of this study. This new definition introduces main features that are affecting to cabin pleasurability and it was used as a basis when key areas for further research were selected. While selecting the key areas for further research recent and ongoing projects were observed to avoid overlapping. Chosen key areas were ergonomics, ISE (Interior Space Envelope) and visibility from physical features and cognitive features as a whole. Also issues related to operator environment safety and quality together with issues affecting to operator health were studied. Because of the wide scope the underground loader LH517 was chosen to be used as example in this study. Key improvement areas found from this type of machine can be applied to other loader types as well. In this master's thesis ergonomics was noticed in its whole meaning. This means that the whole work system which consists of the human, work task, work tools, operating environment and work process were analyzed. In the work was noticed that it is possible to improve the total productivity by developing the ergonomics and usability of the operator compartment which then improves competitiveness in the market. A new definition about key areas affecting to operator productivity was created in this master's thesis. Literature related to ergonomics, usability and safety were widely studied to create a holistic view to these matters. Also an ergonomics and usability study for LH517 cabin was performed by an external partner as a part of this master's thesis. As for the end of this thesis there are some thoughts about how safety and total productivity could be improved even more in the future. With the help of techniques presented in this master's thesis it is also
