The burden of girlhood : a global inquiry into the status of the girls
Examines the broad fictional reading of middle class pre-teen girls in ethnographic detail, and describes the place of literacy in the construction of gender. The book provides evidence to support its central assumption: gender is a cultural and social construction, not a biological given.

Introducing women's studies : feminist theory and practice
This anthology provides exciting, innovative research focused on the construction of adolescent girls' sexuality in the media. The volume includes a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives from the humanities and the social sciences, addressing how girls and others respond to, work with, and even resist prevailing media representations of girls' sexualities and how they use contemporary media as a form of sexual expression. The authors consider a wide array of sexual attitudes, behaviors, and expressions not commonly seen in the sexualities literature, including the voices of other girls whose voices are often ignored, particularly racial/ethnic minority and indigenous girls, sexual minorities, and girls from non-U.S. settings. The use of ethnographic data, in conjunction with media analysis techniques, provides a unique approach to the media studies genre, which tends to highlight an analysis of media content, as opposed to the ways in which media is used in everyday life. -- Provided by publisher.
Suicide notes from beautiful girls
Girlhood and the politics of place
Exploring the spirituality and faith of girls on the verge of adolescence, this book presents fresh insights into children's spirituality and their transition to adulthood. Phillips has listened to girls' voices speaking in depth on the themes of self, God, church, and world, and reflected on their experiences and understandings in the light of current psychological, philosophical and sociological thinking, all placed into dialogue with a feminist approach to contemporary theology and bible. Phillips offers 'wombing' as a metaphor for their transition to young adulthood, and suggests strategies faith communities might adopt to companion girls more effectively through the fragility of puberty. This book will appeal to all those exploring areas of youth ministry, pastoral care, Christian education, nurture and childhood studies, psychology and theology.
The girl of ink & stars
This book offers a review and a feminist critique of mother-daughter literature. The barriers erected by patriarchal, racist, classist and homophobic knowledge between mothers and daughters are explored. Women's writing is used to explore the existing and potential connection and cooperation between mothers and daughters, emphasising the importance of social context for an understanding of mother-daughter relationships. Motherhood is emphasised as a developmental process.

The decision to emigrate has historically held differing promises and costs for women and for men. Exploring theories of difference in labor market participation, network formation and the immigrant organising process, on belonging and diaspora, and a theory of 'vulnerability', A Global History of Gender and Migration looks critically at two centuries of the migration experience from the perspectives of women and men separately and together. Uniquely investigating the subject globally over time, this book incorporates the history of migration in areas as far-flung as Yemen, Sudan, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Poland, the Soviet Union, the US, and the UK, an approach that allows for patterns to emerge over time. A Global History of Gender and Migration further shows that although there are various points on which migrant men and women differ, and several theories exist to explain these differences, this comprehensive guide offers a unifying thesis on the theories and practice of migration, adding to our insight into the mechanisms underlying the creation of differences between migrant men and women.

How young ladies became girls : the Victorian origins of American girlhood
This book focuses on the girl child, her status in developing countries, the constraints on girls from culture, and the impact of traditional practices on girls' health and survival, nutrition, education, and employment. The book aims to direct academicians, feminists, policy makers, and development policy planners and practitioners toward the creation of a more gender-just childhood for girls worldwide. There is a need for parents to develop equal entitlement and opportunity for girl children. Chapter 1 gives an overview of problems facing girls in developing countries. There is no one common definition of girlhood that is legally, culturally, and religiously consistent. The legal age varies with type of law and gender. Some broad generalizations are possible, despite gaps in the data. 1) Girls are fewer in number than boys worldwide. 2) The median age of women increased from 18-19 years to 22-23 years during 1970-90 in developing countries. 3) Girls married by the age of 15 years accounted for an estimated 18% in Asia, 16% in Africa, and 8% in Latin America. 4) Girls are less educated than boys. 5) Nutritional intake favors adult males and the boy child. 6) Reproductive and productive burdens are shared inequitably by the girl. 7) Girls' work is undervalued and unmeasured. 8) Gender differences of importance are attitudinal, and the damage is immeasurable. Chapter 2 focuses on daughter neglect, the socialization of girls, and son preference. Chapter 3 discusses early marriage and its impact on girls. Chapter 4 concludes that the sex ratio is not linked to the development status of countries. Chapter 5 and 6 focus on health, mortality, and nutrition among girls. Inequalities in girls' education and employment are the focus in chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 9 discusses violence against girls. The last chapter establishes some affirmative action goals.

Feminism and youth culture : from 'Jackie' to 'Just Seventeen'
Through the innovative methodology of asking them to record their experiences on videotape, this book offers an evocative and fascinating cross-cultural exploration into the everyday lives of a number of teenage girls from their own broad social, cultural and ethnic perspectives. The use of the video camera by the girls themselves reveals their exploration and experimentation with possible identities, highlighting their awareness that the self is not ready made but rather constituted in the process of continuous performance. The result is an active self-conscious exploration of the continuous "art" of self-making. Through their play, the teenagers are shown to strategically test out various possibilities, while keeping such explorations within the bounds of what is acceptable and permissible in their own micro-cultural worlds. The resulting material challenges previous findings in those feminist and youth anthropological studies based on too narrow a concept of class, ethnicity or populist approaches to culture.

Some readings would see Barbie as reproducing ethnicity and gender in a particularly coarse and damaging way - a cultural icon of racism and sexism. Rogers develops a broader, more challenging picture. She shows how the cultural meaning of Barbie is more ambiguous than the narrow, appearance-dominated model that is attributed to the doll. For a start, Barbie's sexual identity is not clear-cut. Similarly her class situation is ambiguous. But all interpretations agree that, with her enormous range of lifestyle 'accessories', Barbie exists to consume.
