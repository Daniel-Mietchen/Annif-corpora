In Chicana/o popular culture, nothing signifies the working class, highly-layered, textured, and metaphoric sensibility known as "rasquache aesthetic" more than black velvet art. The essays in this volume examine that aesthetic by looking at icons, heroes, cultural myths, popular rituals, and border issues as they are expressed in a variety of ways. The contributors dialectically engage methods of popular cultural studies with discourses of gender, sexuality, identity politics, representation, and cultural production. In addition to a hagiography of "locas santas," the book includes studies of the sexual politics of early Chicana activists in the Chicano youth movement, the representation of Latina bodies in popular magazines, the stereotypical renderings of recipe books and calendar art, the ritual performance of Mexican femaleness in the quinceañera, and mediums through which Chicano masculinity is measured.

We are the daughters of Chicano working class families, who were able to receive a university education. Our history is the story of working people - their struggles, commitments, and strengths. We document, analyze and interpret the Chicana/Mexicana experience in the United States. We are particularly concerned with the conditions women face at work, in and out of the home. We continue our mother's struggle for social and economic justice. Our research strives to bridge the gap between intellectual work and active commitment to our communities. We welcome Chicanas who share these problems and goals and invite them to join our movement.
