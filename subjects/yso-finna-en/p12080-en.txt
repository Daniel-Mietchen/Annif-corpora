Overview: Learn to produce the most accurate radiographic images on the first try with Radiographic Image Analysis, 4th Edition. This thoroughly updated guide walks you through the steps of how to carefully evaluate an image, how to identify the improper positioning or technique that caused a poor image, and how to correct the problem. For each procedure, there is a diagnostic-quality radiograph along with several examples of unacceptable radiographs, a complete list of radiographic evaluation guidelines, and detailed discussions on how each of the evaluation points is related to positioning and technique. Each unacceptable radiograph is accompanied by a description of the misaligned anatomical structures, how the patient was mis-positioned, and how to adjust technique to obtain an acceptable radiograph. Poorly positioned example images appear at the end of procedures to test your knowledge. Spotlights concepts boxes highlight the most important information as it appears in the chapters and directs readers to more information on these topics. Chapter objectives, key terms, and outlines help in mastering important concepts and information. NEW! Expanded sections on pediatric, obesity, and trauma digital radiography provides the most pertinent and up-to-date information needed for clinical success.
