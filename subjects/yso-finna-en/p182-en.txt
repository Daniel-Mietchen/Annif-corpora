Children as teacher-researcher's research partners : action research in the classroom
The topic of this Bachelo''s Thesis is improving the initiation process at the Finnish Institute  in France. The objective of the research is to enhance the trainee's initiation process into the  organisation, with respect to the cultural differences. The objective was reached by compiling  a Trainee's Manual for the Finnish Institute forthcoming trainees.  The Finnish Institute in France is a cultural centre situated in Paris. The foremost task of the  Finnish Institute is to strengthen knowledge of the Finnish culture, science and economy in  France and to promote the countries cooperation in these areas. The Finnish Institute has six  permanent employees and four or five trainees, who change twice a year. It was difficult, not  impossible, to adapt and to learn the ways to work, because the written instructions and  orientation into the organisation were not available. The Trainee's Manual was made up to  facilitate the initiation period.  The theoretical framework in this research reviews the communication channels, initiation  into an organisation and cultural aspects in an organisation. The research was conducted with  procedural method of action research and the data analysis was based on the collected empiric  data and theoretical findings. The empiric data was collected through surveys, interviews and  observations. The surveys were conducted in two periods; firstly before the implementation of  the Trainee's Manual in autumn 2007 and secondly after the implementation of the Trainee's  Manual in spring 2008.  The analysis of the research results was conducted with quantitative and qualitative research  methods depending on the type of the question. As a result the composition of the Trainee's  Manual was justified and its contents were modified according to the analysis results.  Based on the research results it can be concluded that initiation plays an important role in an  organisation, which can be observed from the fact that the theoretical findings support the  research results. The trainees and permanent employees alike find the Trainee's Manual a  useful document. The future challenge for the organisation is the updating the Trainee's  Manual to maintain its benefits for the new trainees.

Action Research differs dramatically from other works on the subject. In this book, action research is more broadly conceived than it is in previous works. Many works on the subject describe the process simply as one in which a problem is identified by the practitioner, some questions are framed, data are collected from some sources, conclusions are drawn, and some action is then taken. Although these are the basic steps in action research, this approach simplifies the process to the point that it renders the project insignificant or as capable of making only minimal contributions at best. Action research, as described and explained in this book, places more faith in practitioners as professional educators who can be trained and expected to utilize elaborate, thoughtful, and significant approaches to solving problems in school settings. Hence, in Action Research attention is devoted to specific strategies and techniques that have traditionally been reserved only for the more advanced practice of educational research. Action research, then, is not merely a type of research reserved for individuals with little if any formal training in educational research. Rather, action research is a viable tool used by professional and skilled educators who incorporate a wide variety of methodologies, designs, and approaches when conducting research. This underlying assumption makes this book unique. Moreover, as will be explained later, action research is not a separate method of research (along with descriptive, historical, correlational, and evaluation research). Rather, it is a type of research that may utilize and incorporate many different methods of research. Hence, this book is also unique because it considers action research as a process that may include various methods to suit its purpose(s). This book is designed to introduce those research strategies that are likely to be used by practicing supervisors and teachers in their attempt to improve school practices on a daily basis. As such, this book might also be a valuable guidebook for conducting action research at the master's and doctoral levels.

Action research, applied systematically to the issue of poor academic performance, provides a high likelihood of improving student outcomes. The action research processes described in this book are honed by many years of successful application, and provide teachers, educational leaders, families and community members with a set of tools for engaging with significant problems in classrooms and schools. This book is designed to provide the reader with an understanding of the nature of action research and the procedures and applications of action research. In addition, it provides practical resources that add to the fundamentals of knowledge available to action researchers. The text is detailed, providing specific guidance for many of the skills that may be required for the different contexts and problems to which action research can be applied. Conceptual frameworks provide a "compass" or "roadmap" that will enable practitioners to keep track of action research processes applied to their work.

"This book challenges the current thrust of neoliberalism and economic managerialism by unfolding a new vision of participatory action learning and action research (PALAR) as a philosophy, methodology, and theory of learning and the facilitation process. The focus is on professional learning conceived as being participatory, collaborative, holistic and transformative, particularly through critical reflection and an affective-socio-cognitive approach. In a unique new approach, Professional Learning in Higher Education and Communities adopts a novel integration of social science with neuroscience to explain the processes and significance of PALAR. This provides the basis for justifying PALAR as an effective way to collaboratively achieve positive change, sustainable development and social justice, based on human agency and democratic values, for the common good and thus a better world for all. This book itself is testament to the critical reflection and affective-socio-cognitive approach that it advocates".

"Bringing a different world into existence - Action Research as a trigger for innovations" was the overarching theme and vision of the international CARN Conference 2011 in Vienna. The chapters in this book are drawn mainly from conference contributions. The authors share practical knowledge which has arisen from their work, and reflect on development processes in schools, in teacher education and professional development, social work, social pedagogy, health care and community development. This book offers what some critics believe has been missing in recent action research literature, namely first person accounts of action researchers who endeavour to change working conditions and social relations in their environment through the conduct of action research. This book is also distinguished by assembling contributions from people who are linking action research to a broad diversity of differing contexts, and who are exploring topics or issues across various applications of action research.

Third spaces and video-stimulated recall : an exploration of teachers' cultural role in an Indigenous education context
Action-oriented work research in Finland : the development of a multiparadigmatic research programme in the midst of an employment crisis
This paper explores the use of video-stimulated recall as a reflective approach for supporting the development of third spaces in action research. The concept of third spaces is used as a conceptual descriptor of the specific intercultural context and relations between the researcher and participants present within the project. The paper summarizes findings drawn from an action research project conducted in partnership with an Inuit school board from northern Québec, Canada. The research goal was to explore the cultural role of teachers in the classroom during a unique teacher training course delivered as part of the project. Course work was structured using a stimulated recall procedure with teachers recording their own classroom practice with the use of video. Based on a content analysis of data drawn from project documentation, teachers' cultural role can be seen as: agents of cultural development; facilitators of cultural transmission; and translators of traditional knowledge. Findings suggest that the establishment of a self-reflective community of practice and 'third space' point to the use of video-stimulated recall as a promising procedure for facilitating dialogue in third spaces.

Despite the prevalence of government research and development (R&D) support programs, evaluation studies based on explicit differences in support allocation are rare. In this article the identification of the causal effect of government support on private R&D effort is based on regional differences in eligibility for European Union Regional Development Funds (ERDF) determined by the population-density rule. Our data is constructed by linking a broad R&D survey to administrative data on all R&D support applications in Finland over the years 2000-2006. We find evidence that the support program has induced additional private R&D among the participants who entered it as a result of higher funding in their region. Among this group one subsidy euro induced additional R&D worth at least 1.5 euro.
