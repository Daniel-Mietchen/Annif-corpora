This project thesis has been commissioned by our client to focus on the creation of a user-friendly manual, describing the financial support instruments available for SMEs from the Finnish development agencies Finnvera and Tekes. The manual will focus on the SMEs in the field of services, specifically in the Experience industry.     In addition to the manual itself, we have provided an assessment tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the financial instruments  to be used in further research and development. The thesis report contains the key definitions plus an effective introduction to the key development agencies, in order to comprehend conceptually the scope of the project. The role of public agencies in public funding is discussed and the project's framework describes how the thesis question is set and addressed through the production of the manual. Further on, the thesis report reveals the various phases undertaken during the project's development process and the rationale behind these. The conclusions section provides an interesting summary of our key findings during the creation of the manual, which could inspire further research.    The project was completed during the year 2011. It was carried out following a similar path that an SME  would undertake by searching via internet for funding opportunities from Finnvera and Tekes. The information presented in the manual is the result of a massive information search, plus a thorough filtering, reformatting and summarizing visually in order to simplify and accelerate the access to relevant information, and the decision making for the target companies.     The project has been a highly valuable learning process about the role of the development agencies in Finland, the financing instruments available for SMEs, the conversion of massive information into well-structured and highly usable knowledge, and finally, the evaluation of these instruments. Additionally, the process of elaborating the financial manual has revealed several of the key strengths and weaknesses of the agencies' current funding portfolio.

"'Since the 1990s, tourism has become a major driver of economic activity and community development in Brazil. New policies and approaches, growing expertise and investment in tourism have brought significant transformation in tourism products, destination development and community involvement. In addition Brazil will be hosting two major sport events in the years ahead, i.e. the Soccer World Cup, in 2014, and the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, in 2016. Brazil offers many cultural and natural attractions but, similar to many other developing countries, it still struggles with issues such as infrastructure, accessibility, product development, service quality, market access and workforce training. This book provides an in-depth examination of tourism in Brazil, critically reviewing its development and management. The social, economic, political and environmental contexts of this emerging global power provide an intriguing backdrop. The book considers important development issues such as the changing policy context, community benefit tourism and indigenous tourism. It explores the impacts of tourism on the environment, changing community attitudes towards tourism, transport infrastructure and sustainability issues in events. Particular segments are explored including backpacker tourism, sensual tourism, adventure tourism and ecotourism and the implications for tourism research and education are examined. The book draws from theoretical foundations and practical insights, and gives voice to Brazilian researchers who are actively engaged in researching tourism. Drawing from cutting edge cross-cultural research, this original and timely book will be of interest to students, researchers and academics in the areas of Tourism, Geography and related disciplines.'"--
