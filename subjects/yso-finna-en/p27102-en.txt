This handbook is a collection of the subjects handled in Encounter Art group-guide training. In addition to Encounter Art group guides, the handbook is well suited to social-welfare, health-care and educational supervisors when they assess the applicability of Encounter Art to the operations of their own units. Encounter Art constitutes group-form visual-art activities that can offer support for myriad life situations. Encounter Art views the individual as a member of his or her community, and Encounter Art activities emphasize use of all the senses. Encounter Art work is phased in such a way that even inexperienced actors get to enjoy the aesthetic magic of making art and appreciative viewing of their works of art together with the peer group. Encounter Art is based on the Japanese Clinical Art system. Since 2006, Tohoku Fukushi University in Japan and Laurea University of Applied Sciences have cooperated on Encounter Art.
