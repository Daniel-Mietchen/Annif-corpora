This article presents the results of the Finnish multi-source forest inventory corresponding to year 2011. For these products, the method uses satellite images from years 2009-2012, digital map data, and field data. The main purpose of the article is to make multi-source forest inventory results available for the foresters, and all the readers interested in forests and forest environment. The field data originates from the 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory from years 2007 and 2008, and from the 11th Finnish National Forest Inventory from years 2009 to 2011. The field data has been computationally updated to the date 31 July, 2011. The basic features of the employed improved k-NN, ik-NN, method are described. The results are presented by the regions of the Public Service unit (regions) of the Finnish Forest Centre and within the regions by municipalities, the boundaries as on 1.1.2011. The estimates are given, for example, for land areas, areas of tree species dominance, age, and development classes and often separately for forests available for wood supply. The mean volume and total volume estimates are given in many different ways: mean volumes by tree species and by timber assortments for forest land, and combined forest land and poorly productive forest land and also for forests available for wood supply, as well as by age and development classes. The biomass estimates are given, in addition to the total biomass estimates, by tree species groups in young thinning stands in which first commercial thinning was proposed for the first 5-year period, separately for stem and bark and branches and foliage. The biomass estimates of mature forests are presented separately for branches, foliage and stem residuals, and stumps and large roots by tree species groups. These biomass estimates are given separately for land available for wood supply. All presented results can be employed in calculating forest resource estimates also for regions larger than municipalities. The error sources for the estimates as well as the reliability of the estimates are briefly discussed in Section 3.4.4 and Chapter 5.

The supply chain management plays a large role in company operations. It is crucial for any company to have a functional supply chain. The lean supply chain management focuses on reducing all non-value added activities from it and make it more efficient. There has been an increasing awareness in the recent decades how valuable it is to have efficient and functional supply chain and lean supply chain management aims for this purpose solely.  Wurth Oy which is a Finnish subsidiary for the Wurth GmbH which is a global wholesale company that operates in over 80 countries. Their product range which is over 125.000 items varies from technical products to screws and accessories.  In this thesis the focus is in Wurth Oy and their inventory management, delivery networks and information technology. The main purpose is to contemplate the current status of these three mentioned sections and using the lean supply chain management theories to find means to make improvement suggestions for their supply chain consisting of these three parts.

The purpose of this thesis was to conduct a research concerning the stock location opti-mization in the warehouse of tire manufacturing facility for Goodyear EMEA, located in Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg. The main goal for the research was to find out and determine tires in the warehouse stock, which are so called fast movers defined by their volumes and shipping frequency and therefore determine optimal locations for these tires in order to enhance the logistics operations in the warehouse. The research was conducted by limiting the affiliated facilities in EMEA to only those, which manufac-ture truck tires in order to maintain proper scale for the research.  Theoretical framework of the research is divided respectively into two main parts. Part A explains the theory and analysis behind the stock location optimization from the local warehouse perspective and the process leading to stock location optimization research, which involved data analysis of stock movements which were compared to current stock locations. Part A therefore explains the activities and operations in Luxembourg facility and the analysis of the chosen tires, their volumes, shipping frequencies and their current stock location. Part B examines the external environment inside EMEA by focusing to the stock transfers and frequencies between other manufacturing facilities into Goodyear Luxembourg. Part B describes the relation between facilities and importance of analyzing the tire shipping between them and Luxembourg. Part segregation is for a reason to separate external and internal environments and demonstrate their interconnection to stock location optimization.  Quantitative research methods were mainly used to gather data to analyze stock movements, transfers and current stock, in order to determine the fast movers and their current locations. Analyzing was conducted primarily by Excel PIVOT tool and with coordination of Goodyear EMEA supply chain team.  The results from the research lead to implementation of new stock locations for variety of tires, which was the eventual tangible goal set by employing company, Goodyear S.A. The research works also as a template and guidebook for future stock location optimization in the GDTO Luxembourg.

In this paper we examine the feasibility of data from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne aerial imagery in stand-level forest inventory. As airborne sensor platforms, UAVs offer advantages cost and flexibility over traditional manned aircraft in forest remote sensing applications in small areas, but they lack range and endurance in larger areas. On the other hand, advances in the processing of digital stereo photography make it possible to produce three-dimensional (3D) forest canopy data on the basis of images acquired using simple lightweight digital camera sensors. In this study, an aerial image orthomosaic and 3D photogrammetric canopy height data were derived from the images acquired by a UAV-borne camera sensor. Laser-based digital terrain model was applied for estimating ground elevation. Features extracted from orthoimages and 3D canopy height data were used to estimate forest variables of sample plots. K-nearest neighbor method was used in the estimation, and a genetic algorithm was applied for selecting an appropriate set of features for the estimation task. Among the selected features, 3D canopy features were given the greatest weight in the estimation supplemented by textural image features. Spectral aerial photograph features were given very low weight in the selected feature set. The accuracy of the forest estimates based on a combination of photogrammetric 3D data and orthoimagery from UAV-borne aerial imaging was at a similar level to those based on airborne laser scanning data and aerial imagery acquired using purpose-built aerial camera from the same study area..

The aims of this study were to explore the mires (peatlands) in Terceira Island of Azores, invent their vegetation and ecology, and classify the mires to the ecological groups. In the field, totally 300 mires were identified and mapped, of which 58 were selected for the detailed analysis of this study. Physical, chemical, floristic, hydrological and geomorphologic data of the mires were collected in 1997-2004. The data were organized and analysed using ordination methods (CA). A detailed distribution map of the mires in the Island is presented. Three major mire site groups occurring in Azores were identified: (1) Basin mires; (2) Transition and raised mires and (3) Hillside and blanket mires. The profiles and the plant species of these site type groups are presented.

With the changing technology, many companies are changing their systems from manual based systems to automated systems. These provide assistance for people who deal with large volumes of diverse types of rapidly changing information. Relational databases incorporated with sophisticated programs allow the user to perform complex analysis in a way that improves the speed and quality of work .The vision of many companies is to computerize their systems to improve production and efficiency and thus be more profitable. The purpose of the thesis was to create a database that manages both the ICT equipments and the help desk in an organization. The Remedy Inventory and Ticketing System application was developed using Ms Access 2003 for the Ministry of Education in Kenya. The thesis is divided into two parts, the first part of the thesis, the author was able illustrate the steps in designing and developing a relational database. The author compares the current system and the proposed system. The current help desk system is using Ms Excel files to manage its data and there is no ICT equipment database in operation. Where else the later part shows the actual design and development of the RITS application given the entities provided by the client organization, backing up and ensuring security for the database. The result of this study shows that though RITS, the proposed system tries to eliminate the faults in the current system, it does not completely eliminate them. It needs to be improved by the use of better, in-the-market applications like SQL and Oracle.
