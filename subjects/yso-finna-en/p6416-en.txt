Estonian War of Independence
Naval engagements during the Estonian War of Independence (1918-1919) formed a major part in her epic struggle for survival. She had the good fortune to have Britain as her ally with the Royal Navy in support. The Estonian and British fleets succeeded over the course of 13 months in eliminating the threat from the Red navy in the Baltic, thereby ensuring Estonia's independence.
