In the last decades, a fast rise of emerging economies, like the BRICS nations, have propelled the growth of tourism worldwide. Meanwhile, a plethora of nature destinations has been developed to supply the diverse needs of the new wave of demand from emerging economies so as to entice the existing tourists from advanced and rich economies. Nature Tourism augments the current literature on the benefits and pitfalls in recent developments of nature tourism, tracing the history in development, highlighting the ecological impacts and showcasing the current practices in nature tourism along with discussions on specific tourist markets from holistic viewpoints embracing lessons learning from various destination nations and continents across the globe. A host of topics with global significance will be explored such as the effect of climate change on nature tourism, technological innovation in managing nature tourism, visitor management in nature tourism and market positioning in a highly competitive environment. These are reviewed in a wide range of countries from USA/Canada, South America, Scandinavian countries, Swiss Alp, Middle-East countries, Africa, China, and Australia/New Zealand. This book will offer significant insight into the nature based tourism and its future development. It will be of interest to upper level students, researchers and academics in tourism, environmental studies, development and sustainability.

Out of the Woods Crisis Management in Finnish National Parks
The objective of this thesis was to study the crisis management of Finnish national parks. In practice this involves assessing the possible crises that could actually occur in the national parks, how these could be prevented and, finally, what kinds of tools are used for managing these.    The theoretical framework of the study introduces crisis management, life-cycle of crisis and national park management. To get a closer look at the national parks, five case studies of different Finnish national parks were conducted. The chosen national parks include Archipelago National Park, Oulanka National Park, Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, Patvinsuo National Park and Päijänne National Park. These parks were selected since they represent different locations, sizes, environmental features and, therefore, also potential crises.     The approach of the study is qualitative and the semi-structured interview was chosen as the main method of research. A representative of each selected national park was interviewed individually. The interviews resulted in five 29–55 minute recorded conversations which were subsequently transcribed for the purpose of analysis. The interviews were conducted in February 2011 and four of them were executed by Skype due to the long distances.    The key findings of the study reveal that various crises can occur in Finnish national parks if the circumstances are favourable and if no immediate actions are taken. Forest fires and various storms can threat all the parks, however, also animal attacks, avalanches and oil spills are potential risks in some of the parks. Many of the potential natural disasters, such as forest fires, are actually not considered crises without their impact on people or infrastructure. Tourism is also increasing in the national parks, thus it should be more closely considered since its negative impact is already visible in some parks. To avoid crises to happen, the importance of anticipation and communication together with co-operation with authorities as well as companies is highlighted. In conclusion, comprehensive planning is the key factor for being a step ahead vis-à-vis crises.
