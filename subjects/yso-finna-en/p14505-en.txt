Intellectual capital is one of the most important assets of any company and its importance is emphasizes in knowledge intensive organisations. In these organisations, it is essential that the employees are motivated and committed to develop their professional skills, continuously learn and to improve their performance. This thesis examines the motivational effect of a pre described career path model in an IT service company. The goal is to further develop the career path model and to examine how well the employees feel the model responds to its purpose of increasing motivation and commitment in the organisation and guiding people in their individual career decisions. In the theory part of this thesis careers and career development are discussed along with theories on motivation. A section on knowledge intensive organisation is included in the theory part, to understand the specific nature of the case company. The theory is based on a literature review, and the aim is at setting a theoretical framework for the study, that can be used in the empirical part. The empirical part of the thesis was conducted as a survey using questionnaires. The results were analysed using both, quantitative and qualitative approaches. The survey was conducted during one week, from November 11th to November 21st of 2008, as in Internet based form, and a link to the form was submitted to the respondents via email. The results of the survey indicate that the employees of the case company are well motivated in their work, very motivated to further develop their professional skills and that they feel committed to their organisation. The career path models under study in this thesis were well received and no clear criticism towards them arose. At the moment the models are very new, so practical experience of the long term effects of the models' implementation does not exist. At the moment it seems, that the models correspond very well to their task of communicating organisational development needs, increasing commitment and increasing the employees' motivation to further develop their professional skills.
