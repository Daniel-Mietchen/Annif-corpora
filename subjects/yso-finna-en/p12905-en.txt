Modern boat maintenance : the complete fiberglass boat manual
In many areas of the world, finding the type of timber needed to build a good quality wooden boat is becoming a problem. As a result, Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) is beginning to be used by many wooden boat builders. The information provided in this manual relates specifically to production of a 4.5 m open fishing boat called the MDV- 1. The boat is intended for both rowing and power propulsion. Its general-purpose design is suitable for inshore waters around the world. A general basic knowledge in the use of FRP as a boatbuilding material is presented and step by step construction of a 4.5 m open fishing boat using FRP is set out in detail. In addition, the booklet describes how to maintain an FRP boat and how to recognize fatigue problems. Some simple guidelines on how to repair minor damage to FRP are also included. The information is intended for less experienced boatbuilders who already have a plug or mould. This manual will also be a useful aid for maintaining and improving quality control practiced by boatbuilders who already have some experience working with this material.--Publisher's description.
