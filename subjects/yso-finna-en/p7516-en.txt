The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to study the investment and operating expenses of bearing pads on different sized container vessels. The results are intended for Cargotec's in-house purposes. Some of the graphical charts may be used for sales aid in customer meetings. The attempt was to prove the assumptions made about the investment and operating expenses. By verifying one of the pad types to be more profitable than the others, the information could be used for sales aid purposes. The results would support choosing a bearing pad type for a certain sized vessel. The second part of this thesis was to produce a calculation tool to be able to explore the effect of changing specific variables. This calculation tool is intended to be used as a help for sales representatives when preparing their sales material before customer meetings. It is intended to be used quickly and easily. As a result, the expenses for four different sized container vessels were specified. The ideal bearing pad arrangement was found for each vessel size and the results were as expected. Creating and using the calculation tool was successful and is working as expected.
