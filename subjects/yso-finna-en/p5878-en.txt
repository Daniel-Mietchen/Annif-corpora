ROI of social media : how to improve the return on your social marketing investment
Integrated Advertising, Promotion, and Marketing Communications speaks to an evolved definition of integrated marketing and teaches students (of marketing or otherwise) how to effectively communicate in the business world. This text covers advertising and promotions, but also the role of social media, blogs, mobile messaging, and other marketing tactics.

"As the digital landscape has changed buyers' habits it's increasingly difficult to reach them early enough in their decision-making process using traditional sales methods. Developing relationships with decision-makers through social networks has become an increasingly critical skill - enabling sales professionals to engage early on and 'hack' the buying process. Social Selling provides a practical, step-by-step blueprint for harnessing these specific and proven techniques including: - How to use networks purposefully to build social trust and create a high quality community - How to develop real influence and authority in your subject area and connect with change-makers - How to scale the social selling strategy across an organisation including maturity and investment models, risk and governance, and technology platforms"--

Wooden furniture industry is a traditional low-technology based and labor intensive industry (Kaplinsky & Readman, 2000), which is highly recommended for global outsourcing. Besides, the raising of "China plus one" manufacturing strategy made Southeast Asian countries became new investment destinations. In case of Vietnam, the largest exporter of wood products in Southeast Asian, wooden furniture industry is highly export-oriented with a fast growing rate especially since 2008 (MARD, 2012). While the global economic crisis in 2008 has a vital impact on the national economy, it is reported that the foreign subsidiaries in furniture industry in Vietnam have outstripped their local competitors (VNS, 2013). Despite the importance of foreign subsidiaries in Vietnam, there is lack of study regarding their competitive advantage and strategy. Investigating on how foreign subsidiaries respond to the external challenges is essential to support strategic knowledge on managing industry? Under the influence of market turbulence. This empirical study used qualitative data from interviews with eight managers of foreign furniture processing subsidiaries in Vietnam. Results indicated that under the influences of global downturn, managers have become more proactive and flexible in their strategic planning when facing with chaotic turbulence, which brings both opportunities and challenges. The study pointed out that the negative impact of global recession was passed through in later time in low-cost manufacturing countries and business risks could be minimized especially in companies with a strong pool of intangible resources (reputation, technology, innovation capability). Despite its complexity, recession was not completely seen a threat, yet the managers perceived it as external turbulence from which organizations can benefit but only if they choose the right strategic orientation.

"Build a disruptive marketing agency for the modern age. The marketing services industry is on the cusp of a truly transformational period. The old guard, rooted in tradition and resistant to change, will fall and new leaders will emerge. Hybrid marketing agencies that are more nimble, tech savvy, and collaborative will redefine the industry. Digital services will be engrained into the DNA and blended with traditional methods for integrated campaigns. The depth, versatility, and drive of their talent will be the cornerstones of organizations that pursue a higher purpose. The Marketing Agency Blueprint is a practical and candid guide that presents ten rules for building such a hybrid agency.The new marketing agency model will create and nurture diverse recurring revenue streams through a mix of services, consulting, training, education, publishing, and software sales. It will use efficiency and productivity, not billable hours, as the essential drivers of profitability. Its value and success will be measured by outcomes, not outputs. Its strength and stability will depend on a willingness to be in a perpetual state of change, and an ability to execute and adapt faster than competitors. The Marketing Agency Blueprint demonstrates how to: Generate more qualified leads, win clients with set pricing and service packages, and secure more long-term retainers  Develop highly efficient management systems and more effective account teams  Deliver greater results and value to clients  This is the future of the marketing services industry. A future defined and led by underdogs and innovators. You have the opportunity to be at the forefront of the transformation."

This thesis was made as a case study for a Finnish company that operates internationally around the world. The company produces various paper products. The objective of the thesis was to find out successful ways of marketing and branding bulk products. Moreover, the thesis represents four successful cases of bulky product branding strategies and benchmarks to them. Bulk products, or in other words commodities, are products that are often traded in bulk amounts and produced worldwide by several different producers (see specific definitions of the most used words in glossary). This thesis was conducted as a desktop study. To achieve the desired outcome, the theory was structured by finding information from both literally and from Internet sources. The theory has been examined from multiple sources and viewpoints and brought into practice by benchmarking to four successful case studies. The case studies represent four real-life cases of commodity marketing: wine, toilet paper, water and coffee. Afterwards a cross-case analysis represents the main points that lead the companies or brands to success. According to the benchmarked cases, humor in branding, design, exclusiveness and cooperation with partners are the factors that make commodity marketing successful. The results state, that commodity products can be marketed and branded in a relatively similar way, as normal goods. The final part of the thesis represents concrete suggestions on how the case company could proceed in order to reach their goals. The suggestions cover humor usage, cooperation with partners (such as famous designers, bakeries, catering companies), focus on packaging and layout. The main findings of the study show that there is an enormous amount of information available and unfortunately, a clear path cannot be found. Commodity marketing, as marketing itself is a wide topic and every brand needs to find their own way of doing it, in order to differentiate from the others and be successful. The provided results are seen to be practical and give some ideas for the case company.
Abstract: The purpose of the thesis was to find elements in marketing the express companies in the case study could use as a differentiation method within the local Finnish market. Express logistics companies are global logistics providers that have overnight delivery capability. The study was commissioned by one of the companies, DHL Express. The qualitative method was used to conduct this study. Qualitative data was collected by a series of semi-structured interviews of express company customers. Four customers were interviewed so that relevant data could be extracted from all different companies in the market. All answers to the interviews differ from one another, a phenomenon common to semi-structured interviews, there were a few answers in common to all of them that allows the author to draw some general conclusions. Customer interviews revealed that the company local image comes mainly from their local product portfolio and the salesperson activities. Their improvement suggestions from customers mainly concern the products and their versatility, and also the personal touch in both products and customer service. Customer service was seen as part of the product. Improvement suggestions to sales contacts were to invest more in quality of the contacts and not the amount, and also the customers like to be taken seriously, and not for granted. In addition the author recommends that express companies involve the customer to the future advancements in both systems and products, to get the highest amount of customer satisfaction possible. Further improvements need to be made for training of both customer service individuals, sales people and marketing staff, also their actions need constant monitoring. According to this study the future products should possibly include different “building blocks” that customer can use to personalize the products to their needs. Furthermore future training of customer service and sales should include more of basic knowledge of human nature and emotional intelligence than just plain sales tactics. Marketing staff should also be trained to produce material with greater impact and quality.

"Bridging the gap between the marketer who must put text analytics to use and the increasingly rarefied community of data analysis experts, Practical Text Analytics is an accessible guide to the many remarkable advances in text analytics that specialists are discussing among themselves.

Practical Text Analytics provides guidance on the application of text analytics for marketing professionals who must interpret the results and apply them in their campaigns.

"One of the most provocative entrepreneurs of our time, who started Eckō Unltd out of his parents' garage and turned it into a media empire, Marc Eckō reveals his formula for building an authentic brand or business. Marc Eckō began his career by spray-painting t-shirts in the garage of his childhood home in suburban New Jersey. A graffiti artist with no connections and no fashion pedigree, he left the safety net of pharmacy school to start his own company. Armed with only hustle, sweat equity, and creativity, he flipped a $5,000 bag of cash into a global corporation now worth $500 million. Unlabel is a success story, but it's one that shares the bruises, scabs, and gut-wrenching mistakes that every entrepreneur must overcome to succeed. Through his personal prescription for success--the Authenticity Formula--Eckō recounts his many innovations and misadventures in his journey from misfit kid to the CEO. It wasn't a meteoric rise; in fact, it was a rollercoaster that dipped to the edge of bankruptcy and even to national notoriety, but this is an underdog story we can learn from: Ecko's doubling down on the core principles of the brand and his formula for action over talk are all lessons for today's entrepreneurs. Ecko offers a brash message with his inspirational story: embrace pain, take risks, and be yourself. Unlabel demonstrates that, like or not, you are a brand and it's up you to take control of it and create something authentic. Unlabel is a groundbreaking guide to channeling your creativity, finding the courage to defy convention, and summoning the confidence to act and be competitive in any environment"--

The Finnish sawmill industry has been placed in a predicament due to changes in the business environment since the 1990s. Along the predicament, the industry has shifted its focus on customer-oriented products from production-oriented products. This can be a manifestation of a surge of value-adding strategy which aims to add premium value on products and has been emphasized in academia. Studies on the effects of value-adding strategy on financial performances are very few and no studies have taken into account the existence of strategic groups in the industry. This study scrutinizes the effects of value-adding strategy as well as cost levels of Finnish sawmills on their financial performances with information of strategic groups. The study employs multiple linear regression analysis and cluster analysis to analyze financial performance and of 180 Finnish sawmills from 2002 to 2011, although not all the data was utilized due to lack of certain information. The study found that value-adding activity positively impacts the performance, especially in the longer term. In addition, investment in the previous year as a mean to implement value-adding strategy can enhance the performance of a firm. As for the costs side, higher material cost and salary generally hamper the performance in the short term. However, the study found the positive effect of salary that improves the performance when the information of strategic groups is taken into account. Although it is impossible to tell which components of salary contribute performance due to the nature of the data that the study used, the importance of investing in human resource should be acknowledged.

Export is the oldest form of international marketing and is still one of the most popular strategies for a firm to reach foreign markets. For many firms, exporting is an important strategic initiative for growth and a vital part of their business operations. Without success in exporting, many firms may not survive or prosper in the intensely competitive marketplace. Unfortunately, successful export marketing is not easy, and many firms lack a good understanding of the fundamentals of effective export marketing strategies and operations. This handbook of export marketing strategy presents a comprehensive and practical guide for firms interested in participating and succeeding in export marketing. Drawing on their sustained research in export marketing and knowledge of the literature, the authors introduce a systematic process for a firm to assess its readiness to export, identify and select viable export markets, explore suitable forms in which to enter foreign markets, develop an effective export marketing plan, work with export facilitating firms, set an export budget, manage the supply chain and logistics in exporting, analyze foreign cultures, adapt the product and promotion, set export prices, receive payment for exported products, and manage and control export transactions. They cover various aspects of a successful export marketing program, discuss detailed tasks and considerations involved in each aspect, and present a set of practical guidelines for firms to follow when making export marketing decisions. The book balances strategic considerations with operational issues and theoretical rationales with practical applications. By reading this book, managers will master the art and science of successful exporting and learn a strategic approach to helping their firms succeed in export marketing.
