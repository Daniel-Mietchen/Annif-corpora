Following Karl Kapp's earlier book The Gamification of Learning and Instruction, this Fieldbook provides a step-by-step approach to implementing the concepts from the Gamification book with examples, tips, tricks, and worksheets to help a learning professional or faculty member put the ideas into practice. The Online Workbook, designed largely for students using the original book as a textbook, includes quizzes, worksheets and fill-in-the-blank areas that will help a student to better understand the ideas, concepts and elements of incorporating gamification into learning.

The changing academic profession : major findings of a comparative survey
The hospitality industry is continuously looking for ways to improve its service. It is under-standable that the customer experience very often starts with the contact of front line employees. Therefore, basic skills and knowledge should be acquired in order to provide customer service quality, which can be achieved through training, as the thesis will show.    The present thesis is project-based  and was set to plan training on customer service quality by using academic research, the practices of leaders in the industry and the authors' own experience. The theoretical framework started by establishing the format of the training discussing topics such as: learning styles; training; and teaching tools. Customer service quality theory; selling; job satisfaction; and team work were to provide the information on the skills and knowledge to be transmitted in the training. The result can be used as a guideline to build an effective training about customer service quality where the learning experience of the listener would be maximised.    In order to create an understandable setting of factors of customer service quality, the deter-minants of service quality, found in the literature, together with the aspects of selling, job satisfaction and teamwork have been redefined. This process is elucidated in the “Easy Customer Service Quality” model, which is the skeleton design of the training.    The attachments include a general curriculum, PowerPoint presentation and handout as a result of the thesis project. Those are intended to be used as tools to plan the training about customer service quality. The general curriculum gets hold of key principles that should be taken into account. The PowerPoint presentation shows a simple layout with note pages of what should be discussed. Finally, the handout is a model that follows the theories put across earlier in the paper.

Human Resource Management in Education debates the fundamental question of how far effective human resource management policies can enable schools and colleges to transcend the paradoxes of the global reform agenda. It analyzes the relationship between leadership, the classroom and results, and uses case studies to explore the extent to which performance is enhanced by distributed leadership and constrained by social, political and economic contexts.

How do you tailor education to the learning needs of adults? Do they learn differently from children? How does their life experience inform their learning processes? These were the questions at the heart of Malcolm Knowles' pioneering theory of andragogy which transformed education theory in the 1970s. The resulting principles of a self-directed, experiential, problem-centred approach to learning have been hugely influential and are still the basis of the learning practices we use today. Understanding these principles is the cornerstone of increasing motivation and enabling adult learners to achieve. This update of a pioneering classic contains all Knowles' original chapters alongside a newer second part by Elwood Ed Holton and Richard A Swanson charting the advancements on these core principles. A third section includes selected readings from previous editions to illustrate the theory's evolution, as well as important articles from other key experts around the world for a comprehensive view. This new edition includes: * New chapter outlines, learning objectives and careful edits of Malcolm Knowles' work to simplify the original theory * Updates to the second part to reflect the very latest advancements in the field * Revisions throughout to make it more readable and relevant to your practices.
