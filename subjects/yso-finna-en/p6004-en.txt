Abstract in english.
The main goal of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment is a healthy mother and a healthy child. The most important complication following IVF/ICSI arises from the increased risk of multiple pregnancies. An elective single embryo transfer (eSET) with the freezing of spare embryos and subsequent treatment with frozen embryo transfer (FET) is the only way to avoid this complication. For this reason, the number of children born after FET is steadily rising.The aim of this study was to provide more detailed evidence on the safety of FET, particularly focusing on serum hormone profiles during the first trimester weeks of singleton pregnancies after IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET), after FET during a natural menstrual cycle, and after spontaneous conception. Another part of this study compared the perinatal outcomes, congenital anomalies (CAs), and morbidity of singletons born after FET and IVF/ICSI fresh ET. The reference group was those born after spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies.In the clinical prospective study, the maternal serum estradiol and progesterone levels in pregnancies after fresh ET (n=39) were higher during early pregnancy weeks than in FET (n=30) and SC pregnancies (n=41), while the hormonal profiles after FET did not differ from SC pregnancies. In the large register study, FET children (n=1830) were found to have a reduced risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, a low birthweight, and being small for their gestational age compared with children born after fresh ET (n=2942). However, FET children have an increased risk for being large for their gestational age. The major CAs and morbidity until three years of age did not differ between groups. When compared with SC children (n =31 243), the perinatal outcome was worse and the rates of CAs and morbidity were higher in FET children.The FET cycle seemed to provide a better physiological environment for early fetal development than fresh ET. Further, FET protects against some of the adverse perinatal outcomes of children when compared with fresh ET, but not when it comes to the major CAs and early somatic health.This study provides further evidence of the safety of FET in comparison with fresh ET. This information should further encourage clinicians to implement eSET combined with cryopreservation in their IVF/ICSI program.

Venous malformations (VMs) are localized defects in vascular morphogenesis which can seriously impede or even threaten the patient's life. VMs are characterized by enlarged, torturous vein-like channels lined by unevenly distributed smooth muscle cells. A large number of mutations in the endothelial TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinase have been found from more than half of the lesions screened, thus providing a common genetic cause. TIE2 has a crucial role in vascular development, remodeling and quiescence. However, the molecular and cellular abnormalities caused by TIE2-mutations in endothelial cells and how they relate to VM formation have been unknown.The aim of this study was to examine how VM-specific mutations affect the molecular characteristics of TIE2-receptor downstream signaling and cellular functions. Because no effective treatment has been available for VMs, a better understanding of the molecular basis of their pathology should enable the development of more potent and non-invasive treatments as well as provide a better understanding of vascular morphogenesis in general.The results demonstrate that the TIE2-VM forms have both common and specific effects on TIE2 and the endothelial cells (ECs) expressing them. Mutation-induced TIE2 autoactivation leading to loss of normal EC monolayer organization due to extracellular matrix (ECM) fibronectin deficiency was found to be a common change. This was shown to occur through chronic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which also caused activation of the proteolytic plasminogen system. Also, most mutations altered TIE2 trafficking and angiopoietin ligand regulated TIE2 functions, albeit through different mechanisms. Using RNA-screening we showed that the most common sporadic TIE2-VM mutation dysregulates genes affecting vascular development, cell migration and ECM remodeling. PDGFB, a major attractant of vascular mural cells, was found to be strongly attenuated due to chronic activation of Akt, which also increases EC survival, by the TIE2 mutant receptors.To conclude, the results in this thesis reveal genetic, molecular and cellular alterations which may potentiate VM formation. This data provides new information on the pathological mechanisms behind abnormal vascular morphogenesis and should assist the development of new molecular treatment strategies for VM patients.

Miller argues that one incarnation of monstrosity in the Middle Ages - the female body - exists in special relation to medieval conceptualizations of the monstrous. Because female corporeality is pervasive, proximate, and necessary, it illustrates the supreme allure and danger of the monster, thereby highlighting the powers and problems of teratology.

Frozen embryo transfer : early pregnancy, perinatal outcomes, and health of singleton children
"About one in every thousand babies born each year has clubfoot, a disorder that affects foot and calf muscles. Because treatment usually begins soon after birth and continues for several years, parents play a key role in the treatment of clubfoot and need to be able to communicate effectively with their child's doctor. The Parents' Guide to Clubfoot is the only book about clubfoot that is written for parents so they can learn everything they need to know about their child's condition. It is an all-in-one resource with medical information, advice from parents, comments from clubfoot experts, and even an illustrated story for preschoolers that parents can read aloud to their children. Written in everyday language, the book covers clubfoot in babies and older children from diagnosis through treatment for mild to severe cases. It provides details on clubfoot, its causes, treatment and care, along with an extensive list of resources and clubfoot assessment aids. In keeping with currently preferred treatments in the U.S., it emphasizes the Ponseti method, which minimizes surgery, and includes perspectives from Ponseti-trained clubfoot doctors and parents of children with clubfoot. However, separate chapters discuss all pre-treatment and post-treatment care options and one chapter covers surgery and post-surgery care if it becomes necessary"--

Hereditary "short tail" sperm syndrome disrupts late spermatogenesis in yorkshire boars
The occurrence of articulatory problems of /r/, /s/ and /l/ sounds as well as their relations to oral and pharyngeal morphology were studied in subjects with different cleft types. Altogether 44% of 6-year-old cleft children had studied misarticulations and the number of errors increased with the severity of the cleft. Boys outnumbered girls in the occurrence of misarticulations of all the studied sounds. Problems with the /r/ sound predominated, and one-fourth needed treatment mostly because of severe /r/ distortions. The frequency of /l/ distortions was surprisingly high. By the age of 8 years four-fifths still misarticulated at least one of the studied sounds. There were no differences due to gender according to unchanged or changed articulation by the age of 8 years. Nearly one third of the /l/ and /s/ misarticulations but only one fifth of the /r/ errors were corrected. New misarticulations appeared similarly whether speech therapy was given or not. Shorter and especially narrower maxillary dental arches and shallower palates as well as posterior crossbites were related to misarticulations in all the studied sounds. Mandibular dental arch dimensions, anterior crossbite alone, large maxillary overjet, or deep bite were not related to the studied misarticulations. /R/ distortion was related to low laryngeal resistance, and anteriorly positioned hyoid bone but not to the smallest nasal cross-sectional area, nasal resistance or velopharyngeal orifice area or dentofacial morphology.
