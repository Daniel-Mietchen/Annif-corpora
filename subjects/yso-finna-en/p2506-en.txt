Political mistrust and the discrediting of politicians
This highly unique book takes a fundamental look at when and how a government can fail at its core responsibility of formulating rules. Government, representing society, relates to the economy by formulating the rules within which (market) players should operate. Although market and business failure are much discussed in the economics literature, government failure is often overlooked. This book addresses this gap, exploring in detail what constitutes government failure. Wilfred Dolfsma illustrates that it is not adequate to discuss government failure simply with reference to its level of expenditure, as is usually the case. Defining government failure and analysing it in the domains of health care, innovation and technology, he explores topics such as how market and society relate, consequences of conflicts between government policies, how government should (not) intervene, the vulnerability of institutions and rules (set out by government), and suggests a welfare perspective for evaluative purposes. This stimulating and thought provoking book will prove a fascinating read for academics, researchers and advanced students in economics - particularly public choice and institutional economics - public administration, policy studies, and law and economics.

"Governments around the world can address many of society's biggest challenges such as the current economic crisis by becoming better at innovating. "The public innovator's playbook" report, published by Deloitte Research in the U.S. with the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Institute for the Democratic Governance and Innovation, describes how governments have the opportunity to help improve the economic environment, create jobs, and more efficiently manage costs. According to the book, governments currently innovate. Moreover, some creative approaches in the private sector come from the public sector. However, few governments take an integrated view of the process or treat it as a disciplineâ€”which includes methodic processes, reward systems, and a mission linked to the process and organizational structure." --Publisher's description.

Corporate governance : a framework for implementation
As a vigorous interpretation of political and social developments in Britain since the late-Victorian era, State and Society has rapidly become one of the most respected and widely read introductions to the history of modern Britain. In this new edition, the account is updated to take in the decline of New Labour, the financial crisis and the Coalition Government. Pugh examines not only the changes in the political and social spectrums but also those elements of continuity linking the past with more recent history. He closes with an assessment of the continuing dilemmas of national unity - encompassing both positive and negative aspects, from the Royal Wedding to immigration and the defence cuts.
Political legitimacy has become a scarce resource in Russia and other post-Soviet states in Eurasia. Their capacity to deliver prosperity has suffered from economic crisis, the conflict in Ukraine and the ensuing confrontation with the West. Will nationalism and repression enable political regimes to survive? This book investigates the politics of legitimation in post-Soviet countries, focusing on how political and intellectual elites exploit different modes of legitimation. Combining cross-national comparisons and country case studies, it addresses state-economy relations, pro-presidential parties, courts, ideas of nationhood, historical and literary narratives. Weak economic performance, evidence of electoral fraud, unresponsive governments and the waning authority of presidents continue to jeopardize institutional legitimacy. Whilst incumbent elites have been able to shift between legitimation modes, this collection argues that shifts towards nationalism, artificial charisma and traditionalism will not be sufficient in the long term to keep elites in power.

US government and politics
This is a critical time for the relationship between Britain and Europe, as politicians debate the crisis facing the European Union and Britain's role within it. This second edition consists largely of new material that charts how recent political developments have changed the debate surrounding Britain's membership of the EU. Following the 2015 general election and with the promise of an imminent referendum on Brexit, the book now considers: How has the renegotiation agenda shifted? How are EU partners responding to threats of departure from Britain? What was the impact of the 2015 general election? What are the politics of a referendum on membership in 2017? How can a pro-European case be made? By seeking answers to these questions, Roger Liddle assesses the impact of a series of miscalculated gambles by David Cameron and his forebears that leaves Britain teetering on the edge of an exit from the European Union.
