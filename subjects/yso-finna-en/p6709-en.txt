Cereals in a European context : 1st European conference on food science and technology
Demand for functional foods that offer therapeutic and disease-prevention properties is globally increasing. Barley presents an opportunity in this regard due to its high antioxidants and dietary fiber contents. Barley wholegrain and milling fractions were investigated in terms of phenolic acids composition, scavenging capacity against DPPH and ABTS radicals and inhibition of human LDL oxidation in vitro. Ferulic and p-coumaric were the primary phenolic acids in wholegrain and pearled fractions accounting for 43-97% and 2-55% of total phenolic acids, respectively. This wide range demonstrates significant differences among barley wholegrain or pearled products. Antioxidant capacities also varied significantly among barleys with the hulless cultivars tested exhibiting the greatest. The outer layers fraction showed higher scavenging capacity against ABTS and DPPH radicals and inhibitory effects toward LDL oxidation compared with the endosperm fractions. The results suggest that the outer layer and hull fractions would potentially provide promising sources of natural antioxidants.

"Compact and reader friendly, this book explores methods for improving quality in breeding and the health benefits of food. Written by a distinguished researcher and teacher, the book emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the field. While focusing mainly on the chemistry, the author brings in relevant theory from basic science such as physics and genetics. Exercises are included at the end of most chapters. Suggested solutions are given at the end of the book. The solutions to the exercises require thinking and, in some cases, searches of the literature. Demonstrations are included to illustrate principles."--Publisher's description.

International cuisine has long conquered our cooking and eating habits. However, regional ingredients and some that were out of fashion for a while are gaining importance again. Accordingly, the range of available domestic and international foods is broad - enriching, but also challenging, as many fruits, herbs, seasonings, fish and meat products are unknown to the consumer.
