"Supply chain management is a cross-functional business concept that includes, for example, logistics and operations management. In many organizations purchasing is now part of the supply chain management function. In addition, the age of the "triple bottom line" is upon us: the issue of sustainability seems certain to gain great momentum and a company is no more sustainable than the suppliers it sources from which means that a wealth of research is emerging that connects sustainability and purchasing and supply chain management. The textbook provides a comprehensive student guide to the field of Purchasing and Supply Chain Management and the links with environmental sustainability. Although there are a number of supply chain management textbooks available, those which cover sustainability at all do so with "bolt-on" chapters - an approach which fails to integrate the key issues. Aimed at the advanced undergraduate (i.e. year 2 or 3), Masters/MSc, or MBA student, this book integrates theory with practice while drawing on relevant industry case studies"--

"Supply chain management is a cross-functional business concept that includes, for example, logistics and operations management. For too long business has focused on short-term cost advantages through low-cost country sourcing with little regard for the longer-term implications of global sustainability. In many organizations purchasing is now part of the supply chain management function, however, a company is no more sustainable than the suppliers it sources from, which means that a wealth of research is emerging that connects sustainability, purchasing and supply chain management. Purchasing and Supply Chain Management provides a comprehensive guide to the environmental, social and economic challenges of how companies manage purchasing and supply chain. This text aims to inspire the development of current and future purchasing and supply chain leaders and evaluates how to develop strategic and sustainable purchasing and supply chain management. Although there are a number of supply chain management textbooks available, those which cover sustainability at all do so with "bolt-on" chapters - an approach which fails to integrate the key issues. Aimed at students, educators and practitioners the book integrates sustainability into each chapter as a core element of purchasing and supply chain management, and it does so through integrating theory with practice while drawing on relevant industry case studies"--

Smartsourcing is the next evolution in outsourcing. Traditional outsourcing reduces costs by moving the work to where the least expensive workers are. While that may cut costs, it simply replicates the status quo. This book shows how to partner with service providers to cut costs and increase innovation across the full spectrum of a business.

Software development has been progressively transforming into distributed development during the last decade. Software outsourcing has been using increasingly more suppliers in low cost countries, such as India and China. Projects implemented in these countries have been criticized for higher business cost eventually due to lower productivity and quality than projects in western countries. The question when to make or buy has led to the need for measuring suppliers. However, measuring subcontractors is not a straightforward issue. Both productivity and quality do not have simple reliable indicators and they both affect each other. The main objective in this thesis was to find a set of metrics that could measure the subcontractor and help them to focus on continuous improvement. Other objectives were to find communication, agile ways of working and tools for improving productivity. The final objective was to study how to increase innovation activities. The metrics were first piloted in two projects and then they were taken into wider use in the company. Case study was chosen as the study strategy. Members of four dfferent projects were interviewed using earlier studies and personal experience as the theroretical framework. The interview material was analysed using content analysis. The main result of the study was a set of metrics consisting of three parts: content, quality and Net Promoter Score. The supplier could not be compared with these metrics but these metrics enhanced communication and continuous improvement in projects. Daily scrums were seen as the best agile principle and the findings about tools for productivity were slim: non-working tools have an extensive negative effect. The last finding involves innovations: as long as outsourcing is expected to be cost-effective with tight schedules, innovative ideas are not to be expected.

Business process outsourcing : process, strategies, and contracts
Outsourcing can be defined as transferring an activity from internal to external control. This thesis studies outsourcing in the wood product manufacturing (WPM) sector from both a customer and supplier perspective. The research design is a multiple case study approach, and it is based on six Scandinavian companies in the door, floor and window industries and one larger supplier of raw material. This study provides an understanding of driving forces for outsourcing in a different context than previously studied and has identified cost reduction in combination with reallocating resources from non-core activities as main driving forces. Compared to several other industrial sectors, outsourcing strategies for the WPM firms have little to do with accessing external sources' capabilities. In the literature, there is often a main focus on the strategic level of outsourcing, however, such heavy resource-based focus in terms of a core competence approach in the formulation of outsourcing strategies at the customer side risks forgetting that components can still be vulnerable to supplier failure. Here, more focus needs to be put on the operational level when considering outsourcing. This thesis illustrates customers considering outsourcing where there are not any given outsourcing supplier partners developed. At the same time, for the supplier side, forward integration and specialising by taking over outsourcing is complicated by an initial divergent production flow of sawn timber. When not all contexts have developed supplier markets for directly managing outsourcing, it should not be assumed that general outsourcing models are directly applicable. In general, the question of whether or not to outsource seems too complex to simply be considered as either “in or out”. A company needs safeguards when conducting outsourcing and in a situation where there is a non-developed supplier market, parallel in-house production becomes an alternative.
