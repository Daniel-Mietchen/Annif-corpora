"ECG Interpretation Made Incredibly Easy, Fifth Edition makes learning to read and interpret rhythm strips easy and fun. This practical and entertaining reference uses a unique, light-hearted writing style that makes learning this complex information non-threatening and highly enjoyable. The book reviews fundamental cardiac anatomy and physiology, explains how to obtain and interpret a rhythm strip, and teaches the reader how to recognize and treat sinus, atrial, and ventricular arrhythmias as well as heart blocks. In addition, the book explains how to obtain and interpret 12-lead ECGs. Special elements found throughout the reference make it easy to remember key points. Each chapter features: A summary of key points; clear, simple explanations of problems; definitions of key terms; illustrations that clearly explain key concepts; bullets, ballot boxes, and checklists that make it easy to spot important points at a glance; sidebars that highlights key facts about ECG interpretation; quick quizzes to test knowledge"--Provided by publisher.

"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)
