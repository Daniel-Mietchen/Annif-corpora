The Handbook of Research on E-Portfolios is the single source for comprehensive coverage of the major themes of e-portfolios, addressing all of the major issues, from concept to technology to implementation. It is the first reference publication to provide a complete investigation on a variety of e-portfolio uses through case studies and supporting technologies, and also explains the conceptual thinking behind current uses and potential uses not yet implemented. Over 70 international experts with countless years of experience lend this handbook the credibility that assures its readers of its extensive, recent, and reliable content. The Handbook of Research on E-Portfolios is the first handbook to investigate commercial and academic e-portfolio systems-home-grown, off the shelf, and open source-and to supply proof-of-concept evidence of successful systems.

Higher education institutions of all kinds - across the United States and around the world - have rapidly expanded the use of electronic portfolios in a broad range of applications including general education, the major, personal planning, freshman learning communities, advising, assessing, and career planning.Widespread use creates an urgent need to evaluate the implementation and impact of e-portfolios. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, the contributors to this book - all of whom have been engaged with the Inter/National Coalition for Electronic Portfolio Research - have undertaken research on how e-portfolios influence learning and the learning environment for students, faculty members, and institutions.This book features emergent results of studies from 20 institutions that have examined effects on student reflection, integrative learning, establishing identity, organizational learning, and designs for learning supported by technology. It also describes how institutions have responded to multiple challenges in e-portfolio development, from engaging faculty to going to scale.These studies exemplify how e-portfolios can spark disciplinary identity, increase retention, address accountability, improve writing, and contribute to accreditation. The chapters demonstrate the applications of e-portfolios at community colleges, small private colleges, comprehensive universities, research universities, and a state system.

Markstrat 2 : A Marketing Strategy Simulation
Frontier markets account for 15 percent of global GDP, yet global investors largely ignore them. Fueled by access to technology and information, these markets are emerging even faster than their predecessors, making them an essential component of a globally diversified portfolio. In Frontier Investor, Marko Dimitrijevic makes the case for their inclusion, arguing&#x0097;through a diverse set of case studies&#x0097;that it is possible if not wise to make informed investing decisions about these unfamiliar and undervalued markets. Markets that were considered exotic two decades ago&#x0097;China, India, South Africa, and Russia&#x0097;are today's mainstream. Dimitrijevic begins with an analysis of how this came to be and looks at the markets that are poised to follow a similar path. He then details a strategy for how and where to invest directly or indirectly for those with limited access but who still wish to profit from emerging market growth. Dimitrijevic covers the political and other risks of taking advantage of these opportunities and the megatrends that may provide new options and open up new countries, such as Cuba and Iran, to exponential growth.

"A comprehensive assessment system for working with underperforming students This book describes a comprehensive assessment system especially appropriate for multilingual and "differentiated" classrooms with large numbers of underperforming students. Drawing from Multiple Intelligences theory, the approach is specifically aimed at helping teachers understand how each student learns and how best to tailor instruction to serve individual students' needs. Although the program makes use of conventional standardized tests and disability screenings, it places special importance on two approaches in particular: Student Portfolio Assessments and Personalized Learning Profiles. Provides detailed guidance and practical tools (including a DVD) for implementing successful portfolio and "profile" practices in the classroom. Includes real-world examples of model assessment programs from five schools. Explains how to integrate assessment into the instructional process as well as how the portfolio program can be used. Formal profiles provide vital information about each student's cultural background, interests, strengths, and capabilities as well as their individual learning and language needs."--
