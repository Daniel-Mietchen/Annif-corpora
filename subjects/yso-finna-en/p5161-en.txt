This is a project based thesis describing the process of writing a wine service handbook for sommeliers. Though the name implies that the guidebook is aimed only for sommeliers, it is written in a fashion that makes it useful for all wait staff who want to better there knowledge on the proper processes of wine service. Yet the guidebook is also designed to give sommeliers and restaurant mangers theoretical background to give a better understanding of the critical phases in wine service processes, which in turn can help in planning and designing wine service processes for restaurants. The need for such a guidebook becomes evident when studying both wine and service literature. Wine literature is often written with the wine connoisseur in mind, and whilst such literature does often touch on the subject of serving wine, it is often not applicable to the restaurant environment. Much of the service literature available is rather outdated, and often serving wine is discussed in a very brief manner, with very little emphasis on detailed process description and often no information on the theoretical background behind service processes. The guidebook itself attempts to approach the subject of serving wine in a very detailed and pedantic fashion, giving both the reader both practical advice and the theories behind the practice. The basic service processes such as opening and presenting a wine bottle are discussed in much detail, with the aim of giving the reader a clear view on how these processes should proceed. The guidebook also explains the specifics of the processes involved in serving; red-, white- and sparkling wines, and the special features of serving wines by the glass; furthermore it describes special service processes such as decanting and sabrage. The guidebook also covers important external factors effecting wine quality such as; service temperatures, wine glasses and wine faults. Finally the guidebook discusses storage of wine, specifically from the view of a restaurant.
