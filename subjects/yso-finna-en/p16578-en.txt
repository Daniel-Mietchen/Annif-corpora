Khadi - textile of India
Today's world textile and garment trade is valued at a staggering $425 billion. We are told that under the pressure of increasing globalisation, it is India and China that are the new world manufacturing powerhouses. However, this is not a new phenomenon: until the industrial revolution, Asia manufactured great quantities of colourful printed cottons that were sold to places as far afield as Japan, West Africa and Europe. Cotton explores this earlier globalised economy and its transformation after 1750 as cotton led the way in the industrialisation of Europe. By the early nineteenth century, India, China and the Ottoman Empire switched from world producers to buyers of European cotton textiles, a position that they retained for over two hundred years. This is a fascinating and insightful story which ranges from Asian and European technologies and African slavery to cotton plantations in the Americas and consumer desires across the globe.
Offers the global and comparative history of textile workers over the course of 350 years, the period that covers the major changes in wool and cotton production (from artisan, via putting-out to factory production), and the global picture from pre-industrial times through to the twentieth century.

"This book explores the fascinating history and present-day practices associated with cotton. This is a story of commercial and cultural enterprise, of war between East and West, of technological and industrial revolution, social modernisation, colonialism and slavery. And yet cotton remains one of the most significant mass commodities today. Cotton's history and track record on labour conditions and the environment have tarnished its history and reputation, even as cotton clothes have become the mark of modern industrialised society. Yet cottons also take other cultural forms and cotton textiles and artifacts are part of a vibrant craft tradition in many parts of the world. This book explores the history, impact and ongoing life of this hugely influential textile"--
