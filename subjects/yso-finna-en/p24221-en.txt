Today, industries and consumer markets are increasingly using services exposed from wireless sensor and actuator networks. Such systems are here referred to as cyber-physical machine-to-machine systems. These systems rely on the capability to communicate, compute, monitor and control by using information. The motivation for the present research arises from problems detected in the remote interaction with embedded devices over dynamic wireless networks in such systems. The problems are caused by the heterogeneity of devices, networks and operating environments, mobility, dynamic presence, security demands of the owners and of use, multiple radios, unreliability, dynamic topologies, and changes happening in the system.The approach selected in this research to address these problems is based on the application of the small-world paradigm to cyber-physical systems. The small-world paradigm is based on the observation that people are often linked in a successful social communication chain by, on average, six intermediate steps. In the present study, it is assumed that the concept of small world can be expanded to also cover communication with wireless embedded devices in cyber-physical systems context. In addition, it is expected that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world paradigm, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking.The main contributions of this research are the technical enablers referred to as dynamic communication spaces, dynamic M2M service spaces, configuration and remote use of services, communication overlay, access systems selection, integrated mobility, secure ad hoc networking, situated opportunistic communication, hierarchical networking for small-world networks, and short-cuts for network optimization. Each of the provided technical enablers contributes towards making remote interaction withembedded devices over dynamic wireless networks possible. The enablers have been evaluated as separate technical methods and means by means of experiments and/or simulations. On the basis of the analysis and synthesis, it was established that they work well as separate building blocks and that they can be combined to expand the concept of small world to also cover communication with embedded devices. Furthermore, it was established that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world concept, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking. In addition, weak links were observed to be essential in the small-world neighbour discovery process. In sum, the evaluation results indicate that the provided enablers help the remote interaction with embedded devices and promote the application of the smallworld concept to dynamic wireless cyber-physical systems.

easy decisions about the trustworthiness of IoT related systems. User will have a general view of the "things" in their environment, and they will be aware of their personal information which they are sending to different devices in the system. The system will provide trust feedback to the users while they are making actions with the system. This will help enable better user experience in future with new smart and intelligent systems. We aim to quantify the user's perception about security in IoT applications as it will give an idea about how people react to smart interactive system and what are their reservations about the IoT related system. These results will benefit the Internet of Things community in developing future applications and provide better experience to the user.

The research problem for this thesis was provided by Rautaruukki Oyj. The purpose of this thesis was to study how modern intelligent wireless local area network monitoring methods and tools could be used to improve WLAN monitoring and functionality at Ruukki Metals steel factory. The research for this thesis was mainly done by studying research papers and articles but also by interviewing specialists and by participating in meetings and presentations. The research was concentrating on different monitoring methods for wireless local area networks and also on the features and characteristics of the selected monitoring software and Ruukki Metals steel factory network environment. The demonstration project was carried out to demonstrate and test the intelligent network monitoring in realistic conditions. The project environment was constructed for Ruukki Metals steel factory site in Raahe, it enabled the possibility to test the capabilities of the intelligent WLAN monitoring tool in an actual factory environment. As well as the existing WLAN network at Ruukki Metals factory, the demonstration project environment was assembled by using Cisco WLAN products. Cisco Prime Infrastructure software was selected as the monitoring tool for the project.The results of the research show that intelligent network monitoring tools are beneficial in monitoring wireless local area networks at a steel factory environment. By using intelligent network monitoring tools, network monitoring and managing becomes more efficient and the function of the network can be improved. Future research possibilities related to this research could relate to improving network monitoring and network reliability. For example effects of using directional antennas and dedicated spectrum analyzators as part of a network monitoring environment. Testing different antenna types and installation positions would provide useful information about what kind of impact they would have on interference tolerance and the range of access points.

number of nodes, versus quadratic for common techniques. SBS algorithm is analyzed through simulations, showing equal performance compared to the state of the art at significantly lower complexity in communication. After estimating pairwise distances, a localization algorithm, based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), is applied on range data in order to find node positions. Localization algorithm estimates the relative locations of network nodes with respect to some other nodes or their absolute locations in a global coordinate system. Different centralized and distributed localization algorithms are studied and their performances are compared in simulation examples.

This thesis is devoted to studying two wireless relay network models, namely wireless tandem multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks and wireless two-hop multicast relay networks.Regarding wireless tandem MIMO relay networks, we develop a systematic approach to analyze their fundamental diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) under the assumption that the relays implement a class of practical full-duplex techniques that enable them to opt for either full-duplex or half-duplex mode. Based on the analysis, we make contribution from the following aspects: First of all, we thoroughly compare the performance of full-duplex and half-duplex mode operations in the framework of wireless tandem relay networks. We find that both full-duplex and half-duplex modes have opportunity to outperform each other.Specifically, for many tandem relay networks, in the low multiplexing gain region, the best relay-mode configuration is to let all the relays operate in half-duplex mode since this relay-mode configuration achieves the best diversity gain in the low multiplexing gain region. However, in the high multiplexing gain region, the best diversity gain is usually achieved by switching some relays to full-duplex mode. Furthermore, we study how residual interference at relays working in full-duplex mode affects the DMT of a tandem network. We find that residual interference not only derogates the performance of full-duplex mode, but also affects the optimal power allocation of the network. Specifically, if residual interference is zero or has a sufficiently low power level, a linear power allocation scheme can achieve the optimal DMT of the network. Otherwise, the optimal DMT is achieved by a nonlinear power allocation scheme.Finally, the DMT analysis illustrates an effective principle to deal with general multi-hop wireless networks, which is to break them down into small sc ale subnetworks with certain key structures. Then, studying the general multi-hop wireless networks essentially becomes studying those small scale subnetworks and the relationship among them.Regarding wireless two-hop multicast relay networks, we focus on a case study where a single source multicasts to two destinations through the assistance of two relays. We propose and analyze the performance of a partial decode-and-forward protocol for the network, which includes the full decode-and-forward protocol as a special case and achieves a better performance in general. Specifically, we prove that the achievable rate of the partial decode-and-forward protocol can either reach arbitrarily close to the cut-set upper bound of the network or reach within 1 bit/s/Hz to that, asymptotically with respect to the transmit power.We also show that the partial decode-and-forward protocol can achieve the optimal DMT of the network. Then, we discuss the perspective of implementing the partial decode-and-forward strategy to more general multicast relay networks.
