"Whales: large, mysterious, intelligent -- and endangered. In 1986, a global moratorium on whaling was issued by the International Whaling Commission. However, that decision was not without controversy. Some countries, such as Norway, continue to whale in defiance of the ban. In this fascinating book, Peter Stoett combines ecological sensitivity with a hard assessment of the political realities of the international regime to examine this important issue. The International Politics of Whaling examines contemporary whaling issues with an emphasis on three factors: our knowledge of whales and current whale populations and the impact of whaling; the actors and institutions involved in the debate over whaling; and the ethical dimension. Reluctantly, he concludes that the current global moratorium on whaling is problematic and that we must focus instead on habitat preservation in order to protect whales more effectively." --Publisher's description.

"This book sets forth a new approach to twenty-first-century criminal justice and punishment, an approach that fully involves the community and provides a better way to make our criminal process more transparent and inclusive. Using the prism of the Sixth Amendment community jury trial, this book offers fresh and much-needed ways to incorporate the citizenry into the procedures of criminal justice, thereby resulting in greater investment and satisfaction in the system. It exposes the various challenges the American criminal justice system faces because of its ongoing failure to integrate the community's voice.Ultimately, the people's right to participate in the criminal justice system through the criminal law -- a right that is all too often overlooked -- is essential to truly legitimizing the criminal process and ensuring its democratic nature"--
