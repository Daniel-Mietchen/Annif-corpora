The politics of coalition lies at the very heart of the political process in most European countries. Coalition can be analysed either theoretically or empirically; the aim of "Multiparty Government" is to reconcile these approaches. Students of European politics are given access to the insights of contemporary coalition theory while this theory is put in the context of the real world of coalition politics. The authors examine five basic themes: the identity and motivation of the actors in the coalition game; the eventual membership of the coalitions they form; their durability; the payoffs that are shared out by coalition members; and the impact of constitutional, behavioural and historical constraints on the process of coalition bargaining. They illustrate their discussion of theory with a range of detailed case studies. "Multiparty Government" offers an accessible approach that bridges the gap between the "European politics" and "game theory" traditions of political science and puts the systematic study of the politics of coalition on the broader political science map.

Parties and democracy : coalition formation and government functioning in twenty states
The British general election of May 2010 delivered the first coalition government since the Second World War. David Cameron and Nick Clegg pledged a 'new politics' with the government taking office in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Five years on, a team of leading experts drawn from academia, the media, Parliament, Whitehall and think tanks assesses this 'coalition effect' across a broad range of policy areas. Adopting the contemporary history approach, this pioneering book addresses academic and policy debates across this whole range of issues. Did the coalition represent the natural 'next step' in party dealignment and the evolution of multi-party politics? Was coalition in practice a historic innovation in itself, or did the essential principles of Britain's uncodified constitution remain untroubled? Fundamentally, was the coalition able to deliver on its promises made in the coalition agreement, and what were the consequences - for the country and the parties - of this union?
