Performance, fashion and the modern interior" examines the interior as a 'stage' upon which modern life and lifestyles are consciously fashioned and 'performed', and from which modern identities are projected by and through design. Scholars from Europe, Canada, America and Australia present a range of interior environments - domestic interiors, sets for stage and film, exhibition spaces, art galleries, hotel lobbies, cafes and retail spaces - to explore each as an intersection of fashion, lifestyle and performance. Sharing the thesis that the fashionably dressed body and the interior can be seen as part of the same creative and expressive continuum, the essays highlight the ways in which interiors can give shape to and dramatise modern life.
"Designing Liners: A History of Interior Design Afloat covers the interior design of these floating palaces from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. The book offers the first history and analysis of this highly significant aspect of the design of interiors, which mirrors and reinforces cultural assumptions about national identity, gender, class and race. The interiors of ocean liners reflect the changing hierarchies of society and shifting patterns in globalization. The trajectory of the professionalization of interior design is the connecting narrative of the book, from the local decorating firm to the internationally renowned architect." "This book provides the first survey of the transient history of interior design in relation to the development of passenger shipping. The history of these great ship interiors is tracked, from their commissioning by the line owners; the materials, methods and sources for the initial creation; their construction; their use and reception. Drawing on a broad range of original research, Anne Wealleans' approach combines design history, architectural history, and material and visual culture."--BOOK JACKET.

This study aimed to assess the ecological status of three urban ponds in the Tampere region by analysing their present condition in reference to previously conducted research as well as other reference criteria.  The main pond of interest was Sorsalampi, as it is presently in the focus of city development plans. The ecological condition of Hautalammi and Vaakkolammi was of interest as reference conditions and was determined simultaneously. The ponds were analysed during autumn/winter of 2009/10. The studied parameters include physiochemical elements, the nutrient level, as well as biological elements and sediment properties. The results of this study are in accordance with previously obtained results indicating that all three ponds are affected by urban and/or industrial pollution and are to a certain extent eutrophicated. According to the criteria of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union, the ecological status of Sorsalampi was estimated between “poor” and “bad”, whereas the status of Vaakkolammi was classified as “poor”. Hautalammi could not be classified.
