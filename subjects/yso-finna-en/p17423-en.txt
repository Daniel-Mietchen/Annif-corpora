"This study of the design, manufacture and use of medieval floor tiles shows the long-lasting influence achieved in the north of England by the monasteries of the reformed movement, particularly the Cistercians. It serves to demonstrate how these monastic houses made use of the resources and contacts available to them." "Over 500 different designs and 60 mosaic arrangements that had been in use in the medieval period were identified from the extant tiles and from searches of published literature and antiquarian records. The study examines changes in the design, production and use of a particular artefact type, in a large region, over a long period of time."--BOOK JACKET.
