At a time of change and review within social care, it is relevant to explore traditional skills, knowledge and values associated with assessment in the context of changing practice. This book introduces and explores assessment in social work in a user-friendly, yet comprehensive way. The author reviews the interpersonal skills necessary for social work practice, applying them particularly to assessment and outlines fundamental knowledge and theoretical models that can inform assessment. The professional social work value base underpinning assessment and the power balance between assessor and the person being assessed is also taken into consideration.
