This paper summarizes a case study within which the concept of design thinking (Brown 2009) has been used to  construct a practical user-centered process to support rapid product concept creation in an entrepreneurship education  program. This process has been established within the DevLAB program at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Finland  which acts as a permanent pre-incubator program for university level students and professionals accessing re-training.  Design thinking was chosen as the basis of the program to support interdisciplinary teams that need to work together  effectively. Design thinking is useful in this scenario since it is a suitable methodology for projects in any field. It is especially  well suited to ill-defined problems. This paper will summarize the context, curriculum and preliminary outcomes associated  with this design thinking process. It will also outline how design thinking has become an integral aspect of the development  phases that interdisciplinary teams of students go through to build prototypes and create start-ups as part of their studies.  While this program is still relatively new, preliminary feedback from participants suggests that the design thinking is an  effective model for supporting the development of project work within entrepreneurship education at the higher education  level. Ultimately, this case aims to educate people who can apply the tools of design thinking into their careers.

In this thesis work there is described the CE-process and product̕s Maturity steps in development process. It was noticed that the early phase of the CE-process design work should be developed towards more functional and modern phase. Reason for this development work was a huge person investment to product̕s plans and the expansion of the first steps of the CE-process. The base for the process renewal was new concepting process proposal. The target was to create more detailed concepting process, which defines working phases before the start of the CE-process. This concepting process was tested in new product̕s concept creation work. Result of this thesis was a description of the Pre E-1 concepting process. By this concepting process work also two new mechanics Maturity Steps were developed: MM-2 and MM-1. The result of these steps is to get more exact opinion for the functionality of the concept results.

A theatrical designer must address two questions when designing a production: What is the play about and what is the play like? To find the metaphor within a play is to unlock inspired and unique design concepts. Theatrical Design: An Introduction is about how to find the design idea for a production and what to do with that idea once identified. This book emphasizes script analysis and interpretation specifically for designers: how to release meaning and design inspiration from lines and characterization in a script. It then explains the artistic elements and principles of design—the skills necessary to create the design visualized. Concepts are illustrated with examples from theatre, film, art, architecture, and fashion that explore professional and historic use of conceptualization and metaphor. Theatrical Design: An Introduction imparts the tools designers need to innovate off the page.
Russians are an important customer segment in Finnish tourism. They make over two thirds of the whole amount of foreign tourists coming to Finland per year. Tourism infrastructure in Tampere region is versatile and potential. The problem is that no large scale efforts are made to attract Russian travelers to Tampere. This research was made to construct an operative model for strategic cooperation network which would act as a tourism development organization concentrating on Russian customers. The network model represents a strategic cooperation between research and development operators and tourism companies in the Tampere region. This collaboration aims to utilize the knowledge resources of both parties in strategically planned processes. The objective of these processes is allocating and conceptualizing the tourism supply for Russian customers through product development. The prospects of making the Tampere region a more attractive travelling destination to Russian customers is feasible. It does not require extensive operations, but it can be done with developing products/services and service readiness/competency. The main objectives are to satisfy current needs of Russian customers, to create more demand and to productize the tourism supply considering Russian travelers.
