Executive coach and psychologist Marshall Goldsmith discusses the emotional triggers that set off a reaction or a behavior in us that often works to our detriment. Do you find that at times you suddenly become defensive or enraged by an idle comment from a colleague? Or that your temper rises when another car cuts you off in traffic? Your reactions don't occur in a vacuum. They are the result of emotional and psychological triggers that often happen only in specific settings -- at meetings, or in competitive situations, or with a specific person who rubs you the wrong way, or when you feel under particular pressure. Being able to recognize those triggers and understand how the environment affects our behavior is key to controlling our responses and managing others at work and in life. Make no mistake -- change is hard. And the starting point is the willingness to accept help, and the desire to change. Over the course of this book, Marshall explores the power of active questions to get us to take responsibility for our actions -- and our failure to act. Questions such as "Did I do my best to make progress toward my goal?" "Did I work hard at being fully engaged?" He discusses the importance of structure in effecting permanent change. Because, he points out, change is hard, and without a structure to keep us on track, we inevitably relapse and fall back. Filled with stories from Marshall's work with executives and leaders, Triggers shows readers how to achieve meaningful and sustained change that will allow us to open our imaginations and escape the rigidity of binary thinking.

Handbook of motivational counseling : goal-based approaches to assessment and intervention with addiction and other problems
Richly illustrated, and with an eye to both proximate and ultimate inquiry, Animal Behavior covers the broad sweep of the subject from its neurological underpinnings to the importance of behavior in conservation. The authors bring nearly 60 years of combined experience as university professors to this textbook, much of that teaching this subject. Animal Behavior includes an entire chapter devoted to the vibrant new field of behavior and conservation; topics such as social behavior and the relationship between parasites, pathogens, and behavior receive thoughtful coverage, along with areas that are routinely found in animal behavior textbooks, such as foraging behavior, mating and parenting behavior, anti-predator behavior, learning, and more. --
