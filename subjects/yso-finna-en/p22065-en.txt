The objective of the study was to analyze how farmers' managerial thinking and management process effectiveness contribute to profitability of farming. A structural equation model of these two elements of management capacity and financial performance was applied on survey data and bookkeeping results from 117 dairy farms. The model explained one-fourth of the varying profitability of sample farms. The results show that farmers' managerial thinking is connected to farm profitability, but management process effectiveness is not. It was concluded that it is essential for good performance that the farmer has a clear vision of developing farming with business and investment plans. Successful farmers also have a firm confidence in their managerial skills, a strong emphasis on instrumental and intrinsic values, and a high appreciation of farming as occupation. They also see the farm as an entrepreneurial business unit and intend to follow the corresponding principles of management.

Food and meals at cultural crossroads : proceedings of the 17th conference of the International Commission for Ethnological Food Research, Oslo, Norway, 15-19 September, 2008
The last two centuries have seen unprecedented change in the everyday lives of Europeans. From the Napoleonic Wars to the end of the Cold War, from the Industrial Revolution to the Computer Revolution, many of these changes were greatly influenced by the scientific and technological advances that took place during that period. This volume in the Daily Life Through History series examines how science and technology impacted the everyday life of modern Europeans in all aspects from of their lives. Science and Technology in Modern European Life shows how science and technology influenced every aspect of daily life: - Transportation: From horse and carriage to the iron horse (the locomotive) and the horseless carriage - Communication: The expansion of mass culture from the advent of the newspaper and the picture postcard to the development of the internet - War and Imperialism: How European technology enabled the colonization of much of the rest of the world, and how the changes in war technology forever altered how war is carried out - The Home: The great changes of household technology, and how these changes altered the relationship between men and women.
