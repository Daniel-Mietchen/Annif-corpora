A boy with extraordinary powers. An army of deadly monsters. An epic battle for the future of peculiardom. The adventure that began with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and continued in Hollow City comes to a thrilling conclusion with Library of Souls. As the story opens, sixteen-year-old Jacob discovers a powerful new ability, and soon he's diving through history to rescue his peculiar companions from a heavily guarded fortress. Accompanying Jacob on his journey are Emma Bloom, a girl with fire at her fingertips, and Addison MacHenry, a dog with a nose for sniffing out lost children. They'll travel from modern-day London to the labyrinthine alleys of Devil's Acre, the most wretched slum in all of Victorian England. It's a place where the fate of peculiar children everywhere will be decided once and for all. Like its predecessors, Library of Souls blends thrilling fantasy with never-before-published vintage photography to create a one-of-a-kind reading experience / WorldCat.

Abstract: Sanitation and hygiene in Kibera slums, Nairobi : women's concerns and nurse's promotional tools. The purpose of the study was to review the relevant literature of sanitation and hygiene regarding women in poor urban centres and explore ways on empowering women on sanitation and hygiene. The aim of the study was to describe the typical concerns for women regarding sanitation and hygiene in Kibera as well as providing women with practical suggestions to improve Hygiene and Sanitation in slums. The data collection method involved reviewing relevant literature which consisted research materials from poor urban centres and developing countries. In addition, United Nations publications and educational books for research were referred to. The findings suggest that there are seven sanitation and hygiene concerns that women experience: Toileting, water, poverty, problems caused by poor sanitation, communicable diseases, insecurity and gender inequality. Nurses need to promote hygiene and sanitation practices by advocating, educating, campaigning and participating in designing community projects that affect sanitation and hygiene. Furthermore, nurses need to work within communities, churches, and schools. As a conclusion, the findings of this study give idea on designing a poster for the community health care nurses who are working with women living in under privileged environments.
