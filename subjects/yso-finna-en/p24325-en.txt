The extracts of Aspergillus niger, Lactobacillus lactis and Nigella sativa seeds as aflatoxin and growth inhibitors of Aspergillus flavus were screened. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal fungicidal (MFC) concentrations of the extracts were determined. N. sativa seeds extract showed a higher inhibitory effect than the other two bioagents extracts. The results show that N. sativa extract inhibits growth and aflatoxin production, which may be due to a reduction in lipid biosynthesis in the toxin producing cultures. The correlation between versicolorin A accumulation and aflatoxin biosynthesis by A. flavus Link was also discussed. It could be of significant importance as bio-preservatives in the prevention and control of aflatoxin production.
