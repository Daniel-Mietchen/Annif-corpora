The rapidly expanding field of food safety includes many new developments in the understanding of the entire range of toxic compounds found in foods - whether naturally occurring or having been introduced by industry or food processing methods. This second edition of "Introduction to Food Toxicology" explores these developments while continuing to provide a core understanding of the basic principles of food toxicology. "Introduction to Food Toxicology, Second Edition" includes new and updated coverage of key topics including the circulatory systems and their influence on toxicity, molecular mechanisms of absorption and excretion, the multiplicity and specificity of phase I and II reactions, toxins from marine food sources including the growing number of toxins from symbiotic bacteria, algae and plankton, focus on the occurrence and modes of action of the central mycotoxins and information on emerging problems, including fumonisins, regulations, including the Food Quality Control Act, solid-pfase extraction, immuno assay, and LC/MS, mechanisms of regulation of xenobiotic activation and deactivation. It also includes developments in the modes of action and impact of natural toxins in food plants, a comprehensive review of the issues surrounding dioxins, the function of antioxidants and their toxicological aspects, acrylamide, its occurrence, toxicity and regulation on its use, phytochemicals, their beneficial effects and the modes of action of this growing group of nutraceuticals from food plants and diet and drug interactions.

This Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) series publication addresses dermal exposure to chemicals. It describes sources and pathways of dermal exposure, models and tools to estimate dermal exposure and methods for dermal exposure prevention and reduction. Furthermore, the EHC introduces skin diseases associated with dermal exposure. This EHC aims to provide information to national regulatory authorities to assist in conducting health risk assessments and managing the risk involving dermal exposure to chemicals.
