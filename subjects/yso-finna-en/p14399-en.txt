Nowadays dealing with data is a daily routine for both individuals and organizations, where this data is stored in all kind of formats. By the increase of the data size day after day, it is more and more complicated for IT staff to deal with the reporting challenges that appear when people want to create reports based on the data, All this causes the increase of time consuming and costs. Reports are used mainly for getting useful information from a stored data, and to do so there are a wide variety of reporting tools provided by many IT companies. Oracle stays the leader on the world market, because it provides the most complete, open, and integrated business software and hardware systems for its customers. One of the well-known reporting tools provided by Oracle is Oracle Reports, which enables businesses to provide instant access to information to all levels in a scalable and secure environment, yet facing new reporting challenges such as diverse requirements, complex infrastructure, maintenance's, more and more Oracle reports users are moving to a new reporting tool namely Oracle BI Publisher.  The purpose of this thesis is to convert several Oracle Reports to BI publisher for Dianti Oy as a first part of the task, starting with the conversion of the reports from RDF format to XML format. Here two converting methods were used, to create a data template based on the XML report. The third stage was creating an RTF template for the converted report by using Oracle Template Builder. The second part of the thesis deal in creating BI Publisher reports based on the converted RDF reports and the different report formats' output that can be published by extracting data just one time. Working on this task was a major challenge during its process, but as a result the objectives of the project were achieved by converting Oracle report to the new environment. This is added value for the client where the results will be used as a base to do further report converting.
