With the rapid development of China and India as new economic powers in global competition, an obvious question is whether these emerging economies are great opportunities or threats. Whilst answers are bound to differ depending on one’s perspective, it is increasingly clear that more local firms, especially local entrepreneurs, from these emerging economies will play a more critical role in global competition by becoming challengers to global incumbents. Indeed, the fact that the majority of their populations are at the bottom of the pyramid, and thus cannot afford products designed for the developed markets, has made these emerging economies fertile ground for developing and applying disruptive innovations. A novel mix of key attributes distinctive from those of established technologies or business models, disruptive innovations are typically inferior, yet affordable and "good-enough" products or services, which originate in lower-end market segments, but later move up to compete with those provided by incumbent firms. This book sheds new light on disruptive innovations both from and for the bottom of the pyramid in China and India, from the point of view of local entrepreneurs and international firms seeking to operate their businesses there. It covers both the theoretical and practical implications of disruptive innovation using conceptual frameworks alongside detailed case studies, whilst also providing a comparison of conditions and strategic options in India and China. Further, unlike existing studies, this book focuses on the neglected perspective of local challengers as the primary players, and in doing so reveals the extent to which the future landscape of global competition may be shaped by disruptive innovation, as well as its capacity to make the world "flatter" and more sustainable.

"Preface Invasion is not a novel phenomenon; however, it is one that has increased tremendously during the past few years due to rapidly expanding trade and transport among countries. It is one of the most important impact humans have ever produced on the earth's ecosystems. In fact, it has led to globalization of world biota, further resulting in biotic homogenization. While some argue that invasion biologists should adopt a more objective and dispassionate stance towards invasive species, everyone agrees that it is a problem that needs attention and action. Recognizing that a deeper understanding of biological characteristics of invasive species and the ecological principles that underpin the invasion process is critical in formulating management decisions, the scientific community has dome an exemplary job in publishing original research as well as synthesis articles on the subject in recent years. Unfortunately, the science is still lagging behind, necessitating a reactive rather than a proactive response to the problem. The body of knowledge is growing so fast, including our ability to predict invasions. This will accelerate the science-based decision making, whether it is for reactive or proactive management or for developing effective public policies. The idea for this book began back in 2009 when the editors organized a regional IUFRO conference on invasive plants in Chandigarh, India. They met again in 2010 at the XXIII IUFOR World Congress in Seoul and finalized the plan for a book that would focus on invasive plant ecology. In addition to selected presentations from the IUFRO conference and the Congress, several prominent authors were invited to contribute chapters on specific topics. In the end, we accepted 18 chapters in the current volume"--

Assessment and management of plant invasions
"Of the 7,000 estimated non-native species present in North America, approximately 1,000 are invasive. Clearly, invasive species are in the minority, but their small numbers don't keep them from causing billions of dollars in economic and ecological harm each year. Policymakers and ecologists continue to try to figure out which species might be harmful, which invasive species are doing the most damage, and which of these might respond best to eradication efforts. Invasive species reports and case studies are prevalent in political, environmental, and scientific news cycles, and a significant portion of the public is concerned about the issue. In this book, Simberloff will first cover basic topics such as how non-native species are introduced, which areas have incurred the most biological invasions, and how the rates of biological invasions have shifted in recent years. He then moves on to the direct and indirect impacts of the impacts of invasive species on various ecosystems, such as habitat and resource competition, how invasive species transmit pathogens, and how introduced plants and animals can modify a habitat to favor other non-native species. Simberloff's final chapters will discuss the evolution of invasive species, the policies we currently have in place to manage them, and future prospects for controlling their spread. The book will also contain a section dedicated to the more controversial topics surrounding invasive species: invasive natives, useful non-native species, animal rights versus species rights, and non-native species' impacts on the biodiversity of an ecosystem"--

"In a work of splendid scholarship that reflects both a firm mastery of difficult sources and a keen intuition, one of Britain's foremost medievalists tells the story of the Christianization of Europe. It is a very large story, for conversion encompassed much more than religious belief. With it came enormous cultural change: Latin literacy and books, Roman notions of law and property, and the concept of town life, as well as new tastes in food, drink, and dress. Whether from faith or by force, from self-interest or by revelation, conversion had an immense impact that is with us even today. It is Richard Fletcher's achievement in this superb work that he makes that impact both felt and understood." -- Book cover.
