"Conflict of interest occurs at all levels of governance, ranging from local to global, both in the public and the corporate and financial spheres. There is increasing awareness that conflicts of interest may distort decision-making processes and generate inappropriate outcomes, thereby undermining the functioning of public institutions and markets. However, the current worldwide trend towards regulation, which seeks to forestall, prevent and manage conflicts of interest, has its price. Drawbacks may include the stifling of decision-making processes, the loss of expertise among decision-makers and a vicious circle of distrust. This interdisciplinary and international book addresses specific situations of conflict of interest in different spheres of governance, particularly in global, public and corporate governance"--

This handbook is a collection of the subjects handled in Encounter Art group-guide training. In addition to Encounter Art group guides, the handbook is well suited to social-welfare, health-care and educational supervisors when they assess the applicability of Encounter Art to the operations of their own units. Encounter Art constitutes group-form visual-art activities that can offer support for myriad life situations. Encounter Art views the individual as a member of his or her community, and Encounter Art activities emphasize use of all the senses. Encounter Art work is phased in such a way that even inexperienced actors get to enjoy the aesthetic magic of making art and appreciative viewing of their works of art together with the peer group. Encounter Art is based on the Japanese Clinical Art system. Since 2006, Tohoku Fukushi University in Japan and Laurea University of Applied Sciences have cooperated on Encounter Art.
