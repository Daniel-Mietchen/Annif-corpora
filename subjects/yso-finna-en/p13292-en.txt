"Entry-level occupational therapists are expected to have fundamental skills in splinting theory, design, and fabrication. As occupational therapy students, they gain these skills through didactic courses, fieldwork, or observations. Orthotic Intervention of the Hand and Upper Extremity: Splinting Principles and Process, Second Edition, delivers just that. Instructors need materials to teach students how to apply theory to practice in the area of splinting. This book provides instructors with the pedagogical framework necessary to help students, inexperienced therapists, and expert hand therapists make the right decision whether to fabricate a thermoplastic or neoprene splint, cast, tape, or choose an over-the-counter splint for their patient. This detailed and easy-to-use reference demonstrates splint fabrication techniques and related interventions for the upper extremity and highlights anatomical and biomechanical principles specifically related to splints"--Provided by publisher.
