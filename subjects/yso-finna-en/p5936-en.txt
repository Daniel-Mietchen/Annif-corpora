Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Western industrialized countries. Approximately 60% of prostate cancer patients receive radiotherapy at some phase of the disease, a treatment based on the use of ionizing radiation to kill or control malignant cells. Unfortunately, adjoining healthy tissues are also affected by exposure to ionization, potentially leading to the emergence of adverse side effects, even several years later. The main radiation treatment modalities are external radiotherapy and low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Different techniques and methods are used to decrease the dose to healthy tissues, thus limiting the possibility of adverse effects. In this thesis a novel technique and associated equipment were developed whereby brachytherapy can be performed by inserting all needles simultaneously. This reduces the implantation time, thus minimizing the impairing effect on seed positioning accuracy resulting from prostate swelling. A phantom model was also constructed for testing and training purposes. DuraSeal® was investigated as a spacer material between the prostate and rectum, and its effect on rectal dose was evaluated during brachytherapy and external radiotherapy. DuraSeal® is resorbed over one to six months, thus altering rectal doses compared with the original dose plan. In brachytherapy, the resorption effect on rectal doses was calculated along with an evaluation of the potential of using different isotopes. In external radiotherapy, the resorption effect on rectal dose-volume histograms (DVHs) was calculated and the need for adaptive planning considered. DuraSeal®, as a spacer gel, clearly has favorable effects on rectal and anterior rectal wall DVHs in brachytherapy and external radiotherapy, and has the potential to decrease adverse effects. It is especially beneficial in hypofractionated treatments and external radiotherapy and brachytherapy combination treatment. In LDR brachytherapy using permanent seeds, dose planning is recommended prior to gel injection to prevent excessive rectal tolerance doses in situations where gel is rapidly resorbed. In external radiotherapy, the use of adaptive planning with a spacer gel improves rectal DVH, but is not necessary according to this thesis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common cancers in Finland. Prognostic factors are important for predicting disease outcome and adjusting optimal treatment. The currently used prognostic methods for CRC have their limitations and consequently several biomarkers have been studied to find potential prognostic markers, but none have been adapted for routine use so far. In the present study, the relationships between the components of the immune system and other factors modulating tumor growth were assessed and their suitability to be used for use as prognostic tools in CRC were studied. The study material consisted of blood samples and surgical specimens collected from 148 CRC patients operated on in Oulu University Hospital and blood samples of 86 healthy controls. Concentrations of endostatin and 27 cytokines were measured from preoperative serum samples and control samples. Immunohistochemical methods were used for collagen XVIII and inflammatory cell analyses. The levels of several cytokines were altered in CRC patients compared to the controls. The serum cytokine profile achieved an excellent accuracy in discriminating CRC patients from healthy controls. Advanced CRCs were associated with elevated cytokine levels and a metastasized disease was linked to an orientation towards Th2 cytokine milieu. The presence of systemic inflammation, depicted by a modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), correlated to CRC progression. The serum endostatin levels were elevated in CRC and correlated with invasion through muscular layer and systemic inflammation, but not with densities of local inflammatory cells. Collagen XVIII was expressed in tumor stroma and in the muscle layer of bowel wall.The serum cytokines and tumor infiltrating immune cells showed relatively weak associations.In conclusion, CRC is associated with significant alterations in serum cytokine milieu, wh ich underlines the relevance of studying several cytokines and their relative alterations. The serum cytokine profile is a promising tool for discriminating CRC patients from healthy controls, but its clinical value needs to be validated. The elevated endostatin levels may result from invasion-related cleavage of collagen XVIII in the bowel wall, but further studies are needed to determine the value of endostatin in CRC prognosis.
