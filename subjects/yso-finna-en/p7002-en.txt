Systematically revised and updated throughout, the new second edition is even more international in scope and includes substantial coverage of the mediatization of politics; of E-politics and governance; of current debates on media effects and framing; of the impact of reality TV and of issues raised by the reporting of war in Iraq"--

In Press Freedom and Pluralism in Europe , researchers from twelve countries examine media systems regarding conditions for independence and pluralism in the current European media system. They discuss a European approach to press freedom and diversity and include case studies of a broad spectrum of media systems including Bulgaria, the Baltics, Poland, Romania, Germany, Austria, Italy and the UK.The volume examines how economic, historic, cultural and social factors have a substantial impact on media independence. With a need for new media policies facing a changing media world, this is an essential resource for media studies and journalism scholars.
