A girl in exile : requiem for Linda B.
The traitor's niche
The successor : a novel
Stefa, a playwright, is called in for questioning by the Party committee after an unknown girl, Linda B., is found dead with a signed copy of his latest book in her possession. Stefa remembers dedicating the copy to Linda's friend, who has since become his mistress. He soon learns that Linda's family, considered suspect, were banished from Albania and that the girl committed suicide. Gradually Linda's story unfolds: how she loved Stefa, and pretended to have cancer so she would be allowed back into the country to be near him, before succumbing to despair. Told through Stefa's eyes, Kadare keeps us guessing, making us share Stefa's concern without knowing what really happened after Linda's death.
