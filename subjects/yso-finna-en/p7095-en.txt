The Action Plan is intended to significantly reduce the burden of preventable diet-related noncommunicable diseases, obesity and all other forms of malnutrition still prevalent in the WHO European Region. It calls for countries to act, using a whole-of-government, health-in-all-policies approach. Its priority actions will contribute to improving food-system governance and the overall quality of the European population's diet and nutritional status.
While exposing quack doctors and nutritionists, bogus credentialing programs, and biased scientific studies, the author takes the media to task for its willingness to throw facts and proof out the window in its quest to sell more copies. He also teaches you how to evaluate placebo effects, double-blind studies, and sample size, so that you can recognize bad science when you see it.

Chapters 1 and 2 define the field of sport and exercise nutrition, the kinds of jobs available, and the education necessary for those jobs. Chapters 3 to 8 cover the essential nutrients of sport and exercise nutrition (carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and balance of water, electrolytes, and fluid) as well as energy balance and imbalance. The remaining chapters cover body weight and body composition, unhealthy eating practices, and the future of sport and exercise nutrition. Each chapter of the text summarizes the latest scientific literature and then translates that information into practices that can be used by athletes, coaches, trainers, physicians, and other professionals.
