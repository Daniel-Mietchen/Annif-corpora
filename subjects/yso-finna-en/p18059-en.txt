The phonetic transcription of disordered speech
The occurrence of articulatory problems of /r/, /s/ and /l/ sounds as well as their relations to oral and pharyngeal morphology were studied in subjects with different cleft types. Altogether 44% of 6-year-old cleft children had studied misarticulations and the number of errors increased with the severity of the cleft. Boys outnumbered girls in the occurrence of misarticulations of all the studied sounds. Problems with the /r/ sound predominated, and one-fourth needed treatment mostly because of severe /r/ distortions. The frequency of /l/ distortions was surprisingly high. By the age of 8 years four-fifths still misarticulated at least one of the studied sounds. There were no differences due to gender according to unchanged or changed articulation by the age of 8 years. Nearly one third of the /l/ and /s/ misarticulations but only one fifth of the /r/ errors were corrected. New misarticulations appeared similarly whether speech therapy was given or not. Shorter and especially narrower maxillary dental arches and shallower palates as well as posterior crossbites were related to misarticulations in all the studied sounds. Mandibular dental arch dimensions, anterior crossbite alone, large maxillary overjet, or deep bite were not related to the studied misarticulations. /R/ distortion was related to low laryngeal resistance, and anteriorly positioned hyoid bone but not to the smallest nasal cross-sectional area, nasal resistance or velopharyngeal orifice area or dentofacial morphology.
