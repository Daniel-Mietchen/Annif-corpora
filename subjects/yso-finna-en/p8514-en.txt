Bold, beautiful and damned : the world of 1980s fashion illustrator Tony Viramontes
"The global interest in menswear has exploded in recent years as the discerning man, whatever his style, looks to express himself through fashion. As a result the industry has seen the rise of a new breed of menswear illustrators who are redefining the industry and its visuals through works commissioned for the pages of GQ, Dazed & Confused, and Vogue Hommes, as well as for the campaigns of Carhartt, Thom Browne, Alexander McQueen, Prada, and Christian Dior, among others. This inspiring survey of contemporary men's fashion drawing introduces a generation of illustrators who approach fashion image-making with sophisticated artistry. From the exuberant street sketches of Richard Haines, made rapidly on the streets of New York, to the delicate drawings of C©♭dric Rivrain or the bold graphic approach of Donald Urquhart, these groundbreaking talents are expanding our perceptions of the modern man. Richard Kilroy, a top menswear illustrator in his own right, introduces and contextualizes the movement before bringing together designers' sketches, street-style reportage, editorial coverage, and commissions for leading brands. Whether drawn in pencil, splashed across a sketchbook, or digitally rendered, the illustrations are as varied in style as menswear itself."--Publisher's website.
