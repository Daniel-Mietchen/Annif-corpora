The big book of the dolls' house
Rozsika Parker's now classic re-evaluation of the reciprocal relationship between women and embroidery has brought stitchery out from the private world of female domesticity into the fine arts, created a major breakthrough in art history and criticism, and fostered the emergence of today's dynamic and expanding crafts movements. The Subversive Stitch is now available again with a new Introduction that brings the book up to date with exploration of the stitched art of Louise Bourgeois and Tracey Emin, as well as the work of new young female and male embroiderers. Rozsika Parker uses household accounts, women's magazines, letters, novels and the works of art themselves to trace through history how the separation of the craft of embroidery from the fine arts came to be a major force in the marginalisation of women's work. Beautifully illustrated, her book also discusses the contradictory nature of women's experience of embroidery: how it has inculcated female subservience while providing an immensely pleasurable source of creativity, forging links between women.

Thinking through craft
"Originating in Finland in eighteen-sixty-five, Educational Sloyd used handicrafts practised in schools to promote educational completeness through the interdependence of the mind and body. These radical ideas spread throughout Europe and America and had a significant impact on the early development of manual training, manual arts, industrial education and technical education. Today it is generally acknowledged that Educational Sloyd laid the foundations of modern technological education. This book traces the development of Sloyd from its conception by Uno Cygnaeus and the first Sloyd school founded by Otto Salomon, to its enthusiastic take up in Scandinavia and beyond. It examines the debates and controversy which surround the Sloyd system, and considers the transition from 'hands-on' craft work to concepts of educational technology. Finally, the investigation reveals the lasting legacy of the ideas and practice of Sloyd education, and how it continues to influence educational technology. Included in the book: - the foundations of Educational Sloyd - debates, controversy and rival factions - key case studies in Finland and Iceland - the lasting legacy of Sloyd education. This fascinating and comprehensive historical exploration will be of interest to scholars and researchers in the areas of educational technology, comparative education and the history of education"--
