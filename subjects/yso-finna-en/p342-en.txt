"Biometeorology has long been concerned with describing and understanding the impacts of weather and climate on humans and their activities and the natural (biosphere) system. Applied biometeorologists have focused on how best to prepare for and cope with weather and climate abnormalities. However they have tended to pursue their research in relative isolation from each other. There is now a need to better understand the commonalities as well as the differences within the broad field of applied biometeorology. The driving force is that biometeorologists are faced with a common problem - how best to provide advice on how to adapt to or cope with climate change. Adaptation is a cross cutting theme. It is an issue which biometeorologists are increasingly engaging with and learning about from each other. Biometeorology because of its focus on the sensitivity of human and biophysical systems to atmospheric variations and change clearly has something to contribute to the wider agenda of managing the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this collection of papers on biometeorology and adaptation is therefore to: Communicate some of the basic ideas and concepts of the sub-fields of biometeorology as they relate to climate change. Explore ideas, concepts, and practice within the field of biometeorology that may be developed in common. Provide a basis for a new vision for biometeorology that will help to communicate its understanding and expertise, as well as enhance its utility."--Back cover.

Special diets; food allergies and intolerances, have been increasing for the past decades in Finland. Many people follow special diets due to serious allergies, but some also due to their own preference. At the same time, Finnish people are used to public dining in their schools and work places and expect that these restaurants offer also dishes according to their individual diet.     Due to the high amount of existing allergies and intolerances, this manual concentrates only on the most important special diets in Finland. These special diets include: milk allergy and lactose intolerance, grain allergy and celiac disease as well as seafood, egg and nut allergy.     Owned by city of Helsinki, Palmia is the biggest provider of catering and facility services in Helsinkia area, operating approximately in 500 service facilities. Palmia offers currently training and information on special diets in Finnish, but they have no material available in English. Their Catering Services sector currently employs 10% of foreign employees and their customer base is continuously getting more foreign.  An English language manual on special diets was formed, in order to satisfy their employees and customers needs and go beyond the customers' expectations. Customer service and customer satisfaction is the most crucial part of any business. Customers, who feel that their needs have been met and have received better service that they've expected, will return and bring their money to the business.     The main goal of this project was to create a manual that would be easy to use, easy to read and would serve its purpose as a general guide on special diets for Palmia's foreign customers and its employees.

"This book is a concise review of the medically important aspects of microbiology and immunology. It covers both the basic and clinical aspects of bacteriology, virology, mycology, parasitology, and immunology. Its two major aims are (1) to assist those who are preparing for the USMLE (National Boards) and (2) to provide students who are currently taking medical microbiology courses with a brief and up-to-date source of information. My goal is to provide the reader with an accurate source of clinically relevant information at a level appropriate for those beginning their medical education"--Provided by publisher.
