Aphasia and related cognitive-communicative disorders
This textbook offers a cutting edge introduction to psycholinguistics, exploring the cognitive processes underlying language acquisition and use. Provides a step-by-step tour through language acquisition, production, and comprehension, from the word level to sentences and dialogue. Incorporates both theory and data, including in-depth descriptions of the experimental evidence behind theories. Incorporates a comprehensive review of research in bilingual language processing, sign language, reading, and the neurological basis of language production and comprehension. Approaches the subject from a range of perspectives, including psychology, linguistics, philosophy, computer science, neurology, and neurophysiology.

This comprehensive text presents both theory and practice in a balanced treatment of impairment-based and communication-based disorders. In a relaxed writing style aimed at students, author Albyn Davis uses a single, coherent voice across the chapters to establish a consistent way of thinking about the material, while noting inter-chapter relationships. Explanatory “walk-throughs” help to make challenging topics clear. Special topics cover therapeutic software and other technologies, levels of evidence, neuroplasticity, new medical treatments, quality of life, and primary progressive aphasia.

Foundations of aphasia rehabilitation
The Handbook of Adult Language Disorders is the essential guide to the scientific and clinical tenets of aphasia study and treatment. It focuses on how language breaks down after focal brain damage, what patterns of impairment reveal about normal language, and how recovery can be optimally facilitated. It is unique in that it reviews studies from the major disciplines in which aphasia research is conducted―cognitive neuropsychology, linguistics, neurology, neuroimaging, and speech-language pathology―as they apply to each topic of language. For each language domain, there are chapters devoted to theory and models of the language task, the neural basis of the language task (focusing on recent neuroimaging studies) and clinical diagnosis and treatment of impairments in that domain. In addition, there is broad coverage of approaches to investigation and treatment from leading experts, with several authors specializing in two or more disciplines. This second edition focuses on characterizing the cognitive and neural processes that account for each variant of aphasia as a first step toward developing effective rehabilitation, given that aphasia is one of the most common and disabling consequences of stroke.
