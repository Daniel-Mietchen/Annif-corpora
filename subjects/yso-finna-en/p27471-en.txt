The Johannine community as Jewish Christians? : some problems in current scholarly consensus
In Community Building in the Shepherd of Hermas, Mark Grundeken investigates key aspects of Christian community life as reflected upon in the early Christian writing the Shepherd of Hermas (2nd century C.E.). Grundeken's thematic study deals with various topics: the community's identity, including its (alleged) 'Jewish Christianness', (lack of) resurrection belief, sectarian tendencies and its relation to the authorities and to the emperor cult; social features, encompassing gender roles and charity; and rituals such as baptism, metanoia, Eucharistic meals, the Sunday collection, dancing (and singing), the 'holy kiss' and reading of Scripture. The many fruitful entries prove Hermas to be one of the main texts for studying the development of community building in the early church.

Alongside his long-awaited systematic introduction to the Pseudo-Clementines, F. Stanley Jones collects into one volume over thirty new and previously published essays on the Pseudo-Clementines, Elchasai, and Jewish Christianity. This corpus spans three decades of concerted research into manuscripts, ancient witnesses, editions, translations, reconstructions, and historical analysis. A chorus of Jewish Christian voices from second/third-century Syria emerges and reveals distinctive beliefs and literary productions in their interface with contemporary Judaism, gentile Christianity, and the pagan world. "The book of Elchasai", for example, is reconstructed and translated as an eye-opening church order from 116-117 C.E. This volume provides vistas for new appreciations of ancient Jewish Christianity as well as of the sparkling diversity in early Christianity generally.
