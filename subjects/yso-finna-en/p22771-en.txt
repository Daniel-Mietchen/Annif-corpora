The studies in "Language Change in Contact Languages" showcase the contributions that the study of contact language varieties make to the understanding of phenomena such as relexification, transfer, reanalysis, grammaticalization, prosodic variation and the development of prosodic systems. Four of the studies deal with morphosyntactic issues while the other three address questions of prosody. The studies include data from the Atlantic creoles (Saramaccan, Sranan, Haitian Creole, Jamaican Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Papiamentu), as well as Singapore English. This volume, originally published as special issue of "Studies in Language 33:2" (2009), aims to make the work of several language contact experts available to a wider audience. The studies will be of use to any student or scholar interested in different approaches to contact-induced language processes, particularly as they relate to morphosyntax and prosody.

Grammaticalization : current views and issues
This book contains the first in-depth corpus-based description of structural nativization at the lexis-grammar interface in Indian English, the largest institutionalized second-language variety of English world-wide. For a set of three ditransitive verbs give, send and offer - collocational patterns, verb-complementational preferences and correlations between collocational and verb-complementational routines are described. The present study is based on the comparison of the Indian and the British components of the International Corpus of English as well as a 100-million-word web-derived corpus of acrolectal Indian newspaper language and corresponding parts of the British National Corpus. The present corpus-based 'thick description' of lexicogrammatical routines provides new perspectives on the emergence of new routines and patternings in Indian English and is conceptually and methodologically relevant for research into varieties of English worldwide.

Rethinking grammaticalization : new perspectives
This book presents the state of the art in research on grammaticalization, the process by which lexical items acquire grammatical function, grammatical items get additional functions, and grammars are created. Leading scholars from around the world introduce and discuss the core theoretical and methodological bases of grammaticalization, report on work in the field, and point to promising directions for new research. They represent every relevant theoretical perspective and approach. Research on grammaticalization and its role in linguistic change encompasses work on languages from every major linguistic family. Its results offer valuable insights for all theoretical frameworks, including generative, construction, and cognitive grammar, and relates to work in fields such as phonology, sociolinguistics, and language acquisition. The handbook provides a full, critical assessment of every aspect of this research. It is divided into five parts, of which the first two are devoted to theory and method, the third and fourth to work in linguistic domains, classes, and cateogories, and the fifth to case studies of grammaticalization in a range of languages. It will be an indispensable source of information and inspiration for all those who wish to know more about this fascinating and important field. -- Book jacket.
