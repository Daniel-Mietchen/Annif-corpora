This paper is an overview on the Open Government Data (OGD) environment in the EU. It aims to point out the relevant legal issues together with the economic aspects arising from the disclosure and exploitation of OGD. Therefore, the paper highlights the noteworthy technological aspects related with the opening of OGD datasets. This survey is based on an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinarity in the digital environment means that OGD should be considered as an integrated, interoperable and collaborative ecosystem. The main legislative source taken into account for the survey is the Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information as recently amended by the Directive 37/2013/EU..

When adapting the End-to-end thinking practices inside an organization, it is important to understand what type of a model it is. What type of a change is required in the organization? For this research, it was important to understand the history of the ITIL, and that is why ITIL is the de facto framework and best practice used in worldwide. It was important to identify the ITILv3 relation and similarity related to the End-to-end thinking. This research was closely linked to the real life problems in the IT process improvement. The episode of the Service Desk and its quality development told the story of continual improvement linked with the theory for literature research. Firstly, based on the principles of the grounded theory, a mind map was used as one aspect for the research method in order to get the big picture of the aspects of the IT Service Management and not limit the scope of the research too much. Secondly, after the mind map phase, the researcher was searched more information of the mapped interest areas. Thirdly, the research was based on the literature part of the Quality and IT Service Management areas.

The results of this research explain the current significant trends, standards, frameworks and tools related to the IT Service Management connected with the needed change drives of the End-to-end thinking. This research result answers the question how to use quality tools efficiently with the use methods supported by the ITILv3 continual service improvement. The requirements of the organization change to the End-to-end thinking Service Management were identified. For the new process, a continual service improvement of the IT service was built up and the process enabled the Service Desk quality improvement.
