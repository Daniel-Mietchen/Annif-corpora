This thesis was requested by the HAAGA-HELIA thesis group on databases and the DBTech EXT project for a workshop where one of the topics is database replication. Its purpose was to test and document database replication techniques in most common database systems. The thesis was done in two parts. The first part was a literature research. It was constructed from vendor manuals, handbooks, studies and white papers. Additionally, re-grouping by functionality was done to help out differentiate replication features of vendor database systems. The second part, the empirical part consistsed of series of tests, where database replication was tested in practice using gathered information from the first part. Furthermore, a setup of replication environment using SQL server 2008 was documented. The literature review showed that all database vendors have exclusive replication products. All vendors have their own concepts and terms, which made comparison of features challenging. In the recap of the first part, replication systems were compared by type and functionality rather than per vendor basis. Furthermore, groups were re-named. According to the empirical tests, database replication can be done in various ways and it proved to be effective system to distribute data where it's needed. Moreover, the tests showed the im-portance of planning. The study concludes that, due to the subject complexity and differences in vendor concepts, sufficient theoretical and empirical background is required to plan, implement and maintain replication systems.

"NoSQL databases are an efficient and powerful tool for storing and manipulating vast quantities of data. Most NoSQL databases scale well as data grows. In addition, they are often malleable and flexible enough to accommodate semi-structured and sparse data sets. This comprehensive hands-on guide presents fundamental concepts and practical solutions for getting you ready to use NoSQL databases. Expert author Shashank Tiwari begins with a helpful introduction on the subject of NoSQL, explains its characteristics and typical uses, and looks at where it fits in the application stack. Unique insights help you choose which NoSQL solutions are best for solving your specific data storage needs. Professional NoSQL: Demystifies the concepts that relate to NoSQL databases, including column-family oriented stores, key/value databases, and document databases. Delves into installing and configuring a number of NoSQL products and the Hadoop family of products. Explains ways of storing, accessing, and querying data in NoSQL databases through examples that use MongoDB, HBase, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Google App Engine Datastore and more. Looks at architecture and internals. Provides guidelines for optimal usage, performance tuning, and scalable configurations. Presents a number of tools and utilities relating to NoSQL, distributed platforms, and scalable processing, including Hive, Pig, RRDtool, Nagios, and more."

"In conclusion as you come to the end of this book, the concept of a Data Warehouse and its primary goal of serving the enterprise version of truth, and being the single platform for all the source of information will continue to remain intact and valid for many years to come. As we have discussed across many chapters and in many case studies, the limitations that existed with the infrastructures to create, manage and deploy Data Warehouses have been largely eliminated with the availability of Big Data technologies and infrastructure platforms, making the goal of the single version of truth a feasible reality. Integrating and extending Big Data into the Data Warehouse, and creating a larger decision support platform will benefit businesses for years to come. This book has touched upon governance and information lifecycle management aspects of Big Data in the larger program, however you can reuse all the current program management techniques that you follow for the Data Warehouse for this program and even implement agile approaches to integrating and managing data in the Data Warehouse. Technologies will continue to evolve in this spectrum and there will be more additions of solutions, which can be integrated if you follow the modular integration approaches to building and managing the Data Warehouse. The Appendix sections contain many more case studies and a special section on Healthcare Information Factory based on Big Data approaches. These are more guiding posts to help you align your thoughts and goals to building and integrating Big Data in your Data Warehouse"--

There are many kinds of data warehouses, in large part due to evolution and different paths of software and hardware vendors. But DW 2.0, defined by this author in many talks, articles, and his b-eye-network newsletter that reaches 65,000 professionals monthly, is the well-identified and defined next generation data warehouse. The book carries that theme and describes the future of data warehousing that is technologically possible now, at both an architectural level and technology level. The perspective of the book is from the top down: looking at the overall architecture and then delving into the issues underlying the components. The benefit of this for people who are building or using a data warehouse can see what lies ahead, and can determine: what new technology to buy, how to plan extensions to the data warehouse, what can be salvaged from the current system, and how to justify the expense--at the most practical level.
