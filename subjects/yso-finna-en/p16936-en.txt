This paper takes a critical stand towards the Mode-2 thesis and the Triple-Helix model as schemes to describe the association of university research with applied motives and commercial and industrial actors. By drawing from a case study of a plant-biotechnology research group, which transformed into a start-up company, the paper suggests that using these models as conceptual frameworks in the empirical analysis may run the risk of glossing over some vital conceptual insights. The first instance where more focused attention should be given is the analytic distinction between theoretical, methodological and applied dimensions of a local research program. By appreciating it, a central source of dynamic that formed the ground for the commercialization of the group's research results is preserved. The second deficiency is that neither the Mode 2 nor the Triple Helix pays close enough attention to the problems and contradictions that come into the world as university research results are commercialized. In this respect, three problem areas are addressed: 1) the ownership of intellectual property rights, 2) the industrial collaboration and the difficulties of transferring the research results to the market, and 3) the failed attempt of creating a hybrid community between the research group and the spin-off company. Also these should be given a more central role in the models since they seem to be vital challenges for researchers-entrepreneurs as they move from academic to industrial focus.
Empirical musicology : aims, methods, prospects
Experimental philosophy uses experimental research methods from psychology and cognitive science in order to investigate both philosophical and metaphilosophical questions. It explores philosophical questions about the nature of the psychological world - the very structure or meaning of our concepts of things, and about the nature of the non-psychological world - the things themselves. It also explores metaphilosophical questions about the nature of philosophical inquiry and its proper methodology. This book provides a detailed and provocative introduction to this innovative field, focusing on the relationship between experimental philosophy and the aims and methods of more traditional analytic philosophy. Special attention is paid to carefully examining experimental philosophy's quite different philosophical programs, their individual strengths and weaknesses, and the different kinds of contributions that they can make to our philosophical understanding. Clear and accessible throughout, it situates experimental philosophy within both a contemporary and historical context, explains its aims and methods, examines and critically evaluates its most significant claims and arguments, and engages with its critics.

An observational study is an empiric investigation of effects caused by treatments when randomized experimentation is unethical or infeasible. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies. Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum's Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher's striking advice for observational studies, "make your theories elaborate".

This volume brings together cutting-edge experimental research from leaders in the fields of linguistics and psycholinguistics to explore the nature of a phenomenon that has long been central to syntactic theory - 'island effects'. The chapters in this volume draw upon recent methodological advances in experimental methods in syntax, also known as 'experimental syntax', to investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to island effects. This volume presents a comprehensive empirical review of a contemporary debate in the field by including contributions from researchers representing a variety of points of view on the nature of island effects. This book is ideal for students and researchers interested in cutting-edge experimental techniques in linguistics, psycholinguistics and psychology.
