"This textbook is organized into three parts. The first explores processes that generate pattern in benthic communities. The middle examines the ecology of specific marine benthic community types, ranging from rocky shores and soft substrate habitats to kelp forests and coral reefs. The close examines conservation and management issues, emphasizing how profoundly marine communities are impacted by humans"--
