"Aesthetics and Politics in the Mexican Film Industry is the first English-language analysis of what some called a "renaissance" at the turn of the twenty-first century. It examines the years surrounding Mexico's presidential elections in 2000 and the fall of the ruling party after seventy one years in power in order to better understand a moment when politics and cinema shared the limelight. Moving beyond the international blockbusters, the research evaluates a broad selection of films, produced from the early 1990s to the present, to help demystify this period for scholars and students.
