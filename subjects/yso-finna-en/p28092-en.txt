This volume captures the essence of how we communicate differences in relationships, between and across cultures, in organizations, through education and in moments of local and global conflict and crisis that demonstrates the importance and viability of approaching peace and conflict communication from various fields within communication studies.In today's global world, it is imperative for individuals and groups with diverse backgrounds, values and beliefs, situated in a variety of cultural, political, economic and institutional structures, to grapple with ideas of diversity, difference and multi-culturalism. The ways in which these fundamental issues are debated in today's society helps pave the path towards a more inclusive, culturally conscious world that allows for dialogue and debate with regard to public policy, educational reform and sustainable peace. This volume provides theoretical and practical approaches that highlight the strength of dealing with conflict and peace issues from areas such as intercultural communication, conflict mediation/negotiation, war and peace journalism, peace education, human rights and peace-building. While communicating differences across cultures and contexts can be a daunting undertaking, Communicating Differences demonstrates how building bridges across silos of research and connecting theory with practice enhances the viability of peace processes and truly and positively affects the lives of students, researchers and practitioners.
