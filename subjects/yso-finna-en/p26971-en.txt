On the geochemistry of tantalum
"A decade ago, hardly anyone had heard of this obscure mineral, used to manufacture the cell phones and laptops that have become so central to our daily lives. Then, in 2000, reports emerged about mines deep in the Congo jungle where coltan was being extracted in brutal conditions watched over by warlords. The UN team sent to investigate revealed how international competition for coltan was contributing to the ongoing collapse of the DRC and the continuation of a war that has cost millions of lives. ... Michael Nest unravels a complex story to offer a clear and compelling analysis of the relationship between coltan and violence in the Congo, and the battle between activists and corporations to reshape the global tantalum supply chain."--
