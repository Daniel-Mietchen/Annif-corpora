"Consuming Music in the Digital Age explores issues related to the consumption of music in the digital age of music technologies. In exploring questions related to the material and technological modalities of contemporary music consumption, to the diffusion of music within everyday life, to individuals' affective responses to music, to their taste and to the relevance of music within their life narratives, this book aims to highlight how music increasingly represents an essential resource to individuals' daily lives. It offers a much-needed update to theories from the sociology of music on individual music practices, while also accounting for the various structural elements that come into play in how individuals consume music.
