Human Behavior in the Social Environment (HBSE) is a critical course for social work students because it introduces them to the very specific person-in-environment, biopsychosocial perspective that sets social work apart from other helping professions. Authored by the foremost scholars in the field, this book takes a theoretical approach to human behavior in the social environment and covers all the major theories--from cognitive behavioral to family systems to psychosocial. Aligned with social work accreditation standards (EPAS), this book provides social work students with thorough coverage of human behavior at every level of interaction.

Bringing together a wide range of European thought on music therapy practice, this book provides a deeper insight into the aspects of the therapeutic process which are enabled by music. With a theoretical, psychodynamic approach and high quality clinical case material from across Europe, the editors stress the role of music within music therapy and show how essential the musician is within the identity of a music therapist.
Addressing current music therapy debates to do with meaning, this text asks such questions as: are words necessary in creative music therapy?; how is clinical improvization distinct from pure music improvization, and if so what is the distinction?; and how do music therapists address culture-specific nuances in music, and in concepts of healing rituals? The text is divided into three sections. The first section explores concepts and theories developed by music theorists an dmusic psychologists in order to explore meaning in music as artform. The second section looks at the relationship between music and human emotion, in order to establish why, and on what basis, music is used as a therapeutic agent. Finally, the third section draws concepts from psychotherapy and music theory into the music therapy sphere. Music therapists are encouraged not to compromise the musical process at the heart of their practice, not simply to borrow concepts from allied theories, but to use these with authority.
