Rural areas around the world are facing serious problems today such as aging and population decline due to loss of employment opportunities and services. Many rural areas have turned to tourism in search of a better future and it has revealed its potential to sustain rural communities by providing significant income and opportunities. However, poorly managed tourism development can also destroy rural communities, which are extremely fragile to rapid social changes. The theoretical framework of this thesis is based on literature, examining the principles of rural tourism, sustainability and the importance of social sustainability in the development and management of rural tourism. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the potential of tourism as a socially sustainable tool for rural development, specifically in the Tampere Region. A specific focus is on Hiking Travel Hit Company; opened in 1992. It focuses on nature and rural tourism, event organizing and wilderness training. The Tampere region is growing very rapidly and it is obtaining many benefits from the changes in the tourism sector. However, little research has been conducted on how tourism has actually socially affected the community. The aim is to evaluate whether this kind of development can sustain the rural community and the entrepreneurs in a socially sustainable manner and thus whether it could be further adopted in other rural areas in the future. And can it provide the desired benefits to the tourism entrepreneurs? The empirical part of this thesis consists of some interviews and a small comparison between the organizations in various municipalities working for the development of tourism. The interviews were conducted in October 2009. The results reveal that entrepreneurs who have been living in the rural communities and then started tourism as a business have not gained many benefits from the tourism but they noticed the increased incomes from tourism development and they put great value to it. The villagers and entrepreneurs also perceive better infrastructure and built environment as major positive impacts of tourism, whereas increased traffic, noise and air pollution as negative impacts. According to this study tourism can be used as a socially sustainable tool for rural development. However, careful management, balancing and community involvement are required. The needs and opinions of local inhabitants and the entrepreneurs need to be taken into account in all tourism planning and social impacts need to be proactively assessed.

The massive growth of the tourism industry during the last 50 years has led the tourists to seek new, unspoilt destinations - often from the developing countries. In the rush to compete about the economic gain opportunities this creates, the well-being of the local population is commonly overlooked. The benefits and costs of tourism are not equally spread. The recent development of alternative tourism has made it possible for the local communities to be also at the receiving end of the tourism profit chain. One example of community-based tourism is Homestay tourism. This kind of tourism has its own characteristics what comes to management and sustainability. This thesis is a case study of the Homestay project of a village in Sabah, Malaysia, called Kiau Nulu. The aim is to define sustainability in small-scale, community-based tourism operations in a rural village setting. In order to do this it was essential to consider the role of tourism in the village, find out who should determine sustainability and for whom it should be developed. The purpose was to provide the villagers with a tool to help them plan their tourism operations. The author used an ethnographic research model, including non-participatory observation, informal interviews and desk research as data collection methods. The data collection was conducted in Kiau village and two other native villages in Sabah during the months from June to August 2003. Villagers and local tourism professionals related to Homestay tourism were discussed with and observed to determine the local point of view to the subject. The results of the research showed, that community tourism operations differ fundamentally from the mainstream tourism in pursue of sustainability, as their product is their own culture and life. Their product cannot be altered, so they have to choose their tourists and concentrate on their own needs and benefit. Also the basic information about the concepts of sustainability and tourisms negative impacts is imperative, before Kiau community can learn to manage tourism sustainably. Tourism must have an objective the villagers set for it. Thus planning and democratic decision making are vital. Becoming dependent on tourism has to be avoided. Sustainability in Kiau has to be determined by the villagers themselves. The scientific 'western' perception of sustainability combined with the locals wants and values can provide an exellent sustainability definition suitable for Kiau's needs and culture. Kiau village has good chances to achieve sustainable development as they still are community-oriented and the values of their ancestors are forming a valuable heritage to rely on. This thesis provides the authors view on sustainability in Kiau, and can therefore present only recommendations based on research.

Ecotourism : principles, practices and policies for sustainability
In the last decades, a fast rise of emerging economies, like the BRICS nations, have propelled the growth of tourism worldwide. Meanwhile, a plethora of nature destinations has been developed to supply the diverse needs of the new wave of demand from emerging economies so as to entice the existing tourists from advanced and rich economies. Nature Tourism augments the current literature on the benefits and pitfalls in recent developments of nature tourism, tracing the history in development, highlighting the ecological impacts and showcasing the current practices in nature tourism along with discussions on specific tourist markets from holistic viewpoints embracing lessons learning from various destination nations and continents across the globe. A host of topics with global significance will be explored such as the effect of climate change on nature tourism, technological innovation in managing nature tourism, visitor management in nature tourism and market positioning in a highly competitive environment. These are reviewed in a wide range of countries from USA/Canada, South America, Scandinavian countries, Swiss Alp, Middle-East countries, Africa, China, and Australia/New Zealand. This book will offer significant insight into the nature based tourism and its future development. It will be of interest to upper level students, researchers and academics in tourism, environmental studies, development and sustainability.

Tourism receipts in Ghana are forecasted to reach $1.5 billion by the end of 2010.Cape Coast municipality that is regarded as the brain box of Ghana's tourism still lack the concept and dignity tourism site should attain.

"'Since the 1990s, tourism has become a major driver of economic activity and community development in Brazil. New policies and approaches, growing expertise and investment in tourism have brought significant transformation in tourism products, destination development and community involvement. In addition Brazil will be hosting two major sport events in the years ahead, i.e. the Soccer World Cup, in 2014, and the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, in 2016. Brazil offers many cultural and natural attractions but, similar to many other developing countries, it still struggles with issues such as infrastructure, accessibility, product development, service quality, market access and workforce training. This book provides an in-depth examination of tourism in Brazil, critically reviewing its development and management. The social, economic, political and environmental contexts of this emerging global power provide an intriguing backdrop. The book considers important development issues such as the changing policy context, community benefit tourism and indigenous tourism. It explores the impacts of tourism on the environment, changing community attitudes towards tourism, transport infrastructure and sustainability issues in events. Particular segments are explored including backpacker tourism, sensual tourism, adventure tourism and ecotourism and the implications for tourism research and education are examined. The book draws from theoretical foundations and practical insights, and gives voice to Brazilian researchers who are actively engaged in researching tourism. Drawing from cutting edge cross-cultural research, this original and timely book will be of interest to students, researchers and academics in the areas of Tourism, Geography and related disciplines.'"--
