This thesis was done for Wärtsilä Finland Ltd. The purpose of this thesis is to describe Wärtsilä 50 dual fuel engine?s automation systems in the gas commissioning phase of the power plant. This thesis is used as a work instruction for commissioning engineers. W50 dual fuel engine is an engine that can be operated with multiple fuel types. These are light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil and natural gas. In this work is concentrated on running the engine with natural gas. The quality of the natural gas has a great impact on performance and on the output of the engine. Engine automation system is used to achieve safe operation of the engine and to make the engine more easily predictable for maintenance. Implementing changes to engine running values is used to achieve efficiently operating power plant. Completed thesis includes a comprehensive content of commissioning the engine automation system.

NOx adsorber catalyst technology has been successfully applied on diesel vehicles to enable them to satisfy stringent NOx emission regulations. One limitation of this technology is the requirement to regularly desulfate the adsorber to maintain high NOx conversion efficiency. In addition to adding significant engine and calibration complexity, these high temperature desulfation events accelerate the thermal degradation of the exhaust system components. Minimization of the severity and the frequency of the desulfation events is highly desirable. Laboratory studies to understand desulfation processes and to identify improved NOx Adsorber washcoat compositions are described. These studies led to a new generation of NOx adsorber catalysts with reduced desulfation temperatures, faster desulfation rates and enhanced low-temperature activity. The new generation of catalysts also enabled the potential for PGM thrifting, especially for applications with low engine- out NOx emissions. These PGM thrifted catalysts demonstrated excellent performance after exposure to long-term sulfation/desulfation/thermal aging cycles.
