European mergers and merger policy
This book is one of the very few published investigations of international business in a Japanese context, based on an up-to-date overview of the Japanese mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in particular. The author explicates recent developments in Japanese business and shows how Japanese firms drastically change to reach out to become more globalized. The book can serve as a foundation in a teaching module for any Japan-related class in international business. Specifically, this publication reveals the inner workings of the Japanese business system. M&A activities covered here include those of foreign firms in Japan as well as Japanese firms investing domestically and in cross-border ventures. Illustrated by carefully chosen examples and supported by extensive data analyses, this book is highly recommended to readers who seek an in-depth understanding of the Japanese M&A market. The volume is enriched by case studies that explicitly illustrate the objectives of specific firms and how they successfully manage their M&A. The author brings to this work his 14 years of experience in Japan and has relied not only on English literature but also on original Japanese sources in creating this highly valuable contribution to the field.

This insightful book focuses upon corporate governance processes, and explores the conditions required for effective corporate governance and control in 21st century globalized and financialized economies. In presenting a comprehensive study of a cross-border hostile corporate take-over process, describing the actors, institutions and events involved, this book examines and questions the current forms of corporate governance and control - both from a national and a global perspective. Using Old Mutual's takeover of Skandia as a case study, the authors address corporate governance theory, and h

Weinberg on take-overs and mergers
Managing cross-border acquisitions
The aim of this thesis was to find out how the acquisition process and the transition period went from the point of view of the personnel in the acquired company, and also to create recommendations for future operations. This thesis was carried out as a case study and it includes both qualitative and quantitative data. An Internet link to an anonymous survey was sent to the personnel by e-mail in the end of November when the transition period was officially over. The survey was sent to 15 people of whom 14 answered. The response percentage was 93%.  The survey results reveal that in this acquisition the higher-level reporting regarding general issues was managed well, but more problems occurred as it came closer to daily operations. The general issues regarding the change were well informed during the transition period and the cutover went as smoothly as planned. The core problems consisted of a shortage of resources, the allocation of resources and inadequate training and testing. Internal communication supported the transition period well and the usage of different communication methods was versatile.
