The bombs that brought us together
At the water's edge : a novel
The hanging garden
Adam felt alone in the strange, new city. He missed the colours and friendships of his faraway home. But when a teacher at school gives him a few seeds, she plants an idea in him - an idea that could transform his grey world for ever. Michael Foreman's beautifully-illustrated story is a powerful fable of how friendship can grow in our world.
