Effective meetings
From Nanoscience to Nanotechnology : Leopoldina Symposium, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, September 4 to 5,2003
Whether you're hosting a conference call or running a WebEx meeting, virtual meetings are ripe for problems. Poor call quality, people forgetting to mute, people staying muted rather than participating--the list of things that can and do go wrong is endless. But you can prepare and lead an effective meeting from afar. This book will quickly bring you up to speed. With guiding principles and tips for making your virtual meeting run smoothly, you'll tick through every item on your agenda. Running Virtual Meetings guides you through the basics of: - Conducting efficient and productive virtual meetings - Preparing for a successful meeting--from crafting a realistic agenda to performing a technological test-drive - Managing common problems, such as connectivity issues, low talkers, blowhards, and background noise - Following up and holding people accountable when your attendees are spread all over the globe.--
