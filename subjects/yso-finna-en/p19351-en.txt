"Organizations are under constant pressure to be ambidextrous. They must be able to exploit existing processes, routines and systems at the same time as they must engage in exploration through playfulness, relaxed control and experimentation. We know little about the human costs and challenges of ambidexterity. In this volume we explore the impact of ambidextrous organizations on individuals' working lives. The authors analyze how employees are required to follow routines at the same time as they are expected to break these routines. They also explore how the individual dilemmas of ambidexterity play out in the lives of precarious work, online communities, management consultants, workers in the automotive industry, and consumers of pop-management books in the US. The result is a rich and fascinating picture of individuals whose working lives are made up of a continued tension between the quest to be exploitative and explorative." --Publisher's description.

Human resource management
The major asset of a hospitality company is its staff. Companies want to hold on to their good employees. Staff turnover is the movement of people out of the company. The thesis aims to find how the managers view staff turnover today, how organisations calculate staff turnover, measure it and manage staff turnover. Furthermore, the thesis aims to find what costs staff turnover causes for the company. The thesis consists of theoretical background about human resource management and staff turnover. The empirical part was done with a questionnaire based on the theoretical part. Ten managers in Finland's capital region's Scandic hotels were interviewed in January 2002. The interview was done in the hotel the manager was working in and each manager was in control of his department's human resource management. The major findings of the study were that human resource management is highly valued in among the respondents. The major reasons for staff turnover among employees were lack of advancement opportunities, inadequate pay and leaving to continue education. Staff turnover was seen to cause costs in training, lower service level and customer satisfaction. On the other hand, staff turnover was seen to bring new ideas to the company. Staff turnover is managed with normal human resource management methods, with the most important being career planning, performance appraisal, competitive wages and employee training.
