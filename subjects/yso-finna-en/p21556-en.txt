Dear Brother, Gracious Maecenas: Latin letters of the Gyldenstolpe Brothers (1661-1680) presents Latin letters exchanged between six sons of Michael Wexionius Gyldenstolpe, the first Professor of History and Politics at the Academy of Turku. The letters offer insights into the life of a seventeenth-century educated family; their subject matters range from learned discussion to gossip and from largerworld news to family items. The Gyldenstolpe brothers tell about their education, career search, travels, sociel networks, marriage negotiations, jobs, finances, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. In the present volume, the letters that have been preserved in one manuscript are edited; their contents are discribed in English synopses and commented upon. The introductory chapter dicusses the language, epistolary style and conventions of Latin letter writing. The volume serves readers interested in several aspects of Swedish and Finnish history and culture in the early modern period.
