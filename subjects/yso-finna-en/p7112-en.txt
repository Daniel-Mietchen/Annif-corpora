Nonparametric efficiency analysis under uncertainty : a first-order stochastic dominance approach
"Just as pilots and doctors improve by studying crash reports and postmortems, experience designers can improve by learning how customer experience failures cause products to fail in the marketplace. Rather than proseytizing a particular approach to design, Why We Fail holistically explores what teams actually built, why the products failed, and how we can learn from the past to avoid failure ourselves.

This thesis was commissioned by the purchasing department of Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy, Turku to clarify the present state of electronic invoicing and to find suggestions for development. Some of the classified material was revised for publication. The focus was on numerical statistics of invoicing information to execute a development project's pre-research stage. Tampere site was used for benchmarking. The literary researches about electronic invoicing and supplier relationship management supported the practical examinations done for the client company. The practical research examined the invoicing figures in both sites and compared each other. A supplier questionnaire about electronic invoicing was made to explain the actual experiences of the suppliers about the challenges and benefits from e-invoicing actions with Sandvik. Later the practical research exploited the Pareto-analysis for categorizing the supplier base. The work included a creation of a process flow chart to understand the actual process flow at the moment and instructions about e-invoicing implementation for suppliers for future needs. There were also suggestions for future to eliminate the high level of errors in e-invoices because a development project is not efficient for a process that is primarily working only partially. The actual results were gained from the calculations about possible savings. It was discovered that even a small amount of certain suppliers would create a significant amount of monetary savings when integrated into the electronic invoicing system. Finally, suggestions for future researches were made. They aim to continue this particular project in Sandvik or exploit this thesis work for some other company in the same development intentions. Another possibility would be to review this work's accuracy and reliability.
