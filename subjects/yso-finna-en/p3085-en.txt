Abstract: The present thesis work was dedicated to analyze inorganic salt solutions and their properties under vacuum conditions, specifically boiling point elevation and saturation concentration as functions of temperature and pressure. Water Group Ltd. Oy is operating in a field of industrial water processing and one of its key activities is industrial evaporation, as a part of water purification systems.  In the present research work solutions of four inorganic salts and their properties were studied. The analyses described in this thesis work were made in chemical laboratory of Satakunta University of Applied Sciences using equipment supplied by Water Group Ltd., which consisted of rotary evaporator BÜCHI Rotavap R-114 and auxiliary equipment.  Analyses of NaCl and Na2SO4 solutions verified the theory that boiling point elevation of given concentration does not depend on pressure and is constant. Saturation concentration of studied salts also did not depend on pressure, but only on temperature. According to the results solubility of Na2SO4 decreases considerably with an increase of NaCl concentration. The results of laboratory experiments correlated well with the available in literature data and proved efficiency and suitability of the developed methodic for studying parameters of evaporation processes.  The methodic of analyses used in the present thesis work can be applied for studies of other inorganic and organic solutions. The obtained results of laboratory tests will further be used for designing industrial scale evaporators.
