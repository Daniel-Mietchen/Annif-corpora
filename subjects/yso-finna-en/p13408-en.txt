The undying flame : Ballads and songs of the holocaust
A road trip adventure about a trio of jazz-camp escapees who, against every realistic expectation, become a band. For Wes and Corey, jazz camp turns out to be lame. It's pretty much all dudes talking in Jazz Voice. But then they jam with Ash, a charismatic girl with an unusual sound, and the three just click. Ash makes a decision: they need to hit the road. Because the road, not summer camp, is where bands get good. Before Wes and Corey know it theyre in Ashs SUV heading south, and The Haters Summer of Hate Tour has begun.
