In 1984, a longitudinal study was launched at the University of Notre Dame to evaluate the social and psychological consequences of teenage parenting. Interwoven Lives (Erlbaum) described, in detail, the development of these adolescent mothers and their children across the first eight years of life. Major delays were first noticed in children;s patterns of attachment at age 1 and their IQ and personal adjustment scores at age 3. By age 8, school-related problems were found in 70% of the children. With these data as the backdrop, this companion volume, Risk and Resilience, identifies major risk factors associated with long-term developmental delays as well as the processes that led to resilience in some of the mothers and children. This new volume traces the children's development at ages 8, 10, and 14. The editors focus on identifying risk and protective factors associated with important life course trajectories as the mothers entered early adulthood and their children became adolescents. Relatively unexplored protective factors; such as religiosity, patterns of father involvement, and romantic relationships; were found to positively influence development for both teenage mothers and their children. This new text also addresses: new methodological approaches with an emphasis on the use of hierarchical linear and structural equation modeling and dynamical systems analyses; implications for strengthening prevention and intervention programs; intellectual, educational, and socioemotional outcome data on the participants; the dark side of rearing children in poverty; the multiple risks related to adolescent parenting and their profound impact on children's development and how resilience emerges in children's lives and the specific factors that promote it. Risk and Resilience appeals to researchers in developmental psychology and family processes as well as agency and government professionals charged with public policy and service delivery.

Family futures is about family life in areas of concentrated poverty and social problems where surrounding conditions make bringing up children more difficult and family life is more fraught and limited. This book is based on a longitudinal study of more than 200 families interviewed annually over the last decade. It answers three important questions in the works of families themselves: What challenges face families in poor areas? How are the challenges being met? Have government efforts helped or hindered progress over the past decade?--From cover, [p]. 4.

Longitudinal research is a broad field in which substantial advances have been made over the past decade. Unlike many of the existing books that only address the analysis of information. "The Handbook of Longitudinal Research" covers design and measurement as well as the data analysis. Designed for use by a wide-ranging audience, this "Handbook" not only includes perspective on the methodological and data analysis problems in longitudinal research but it also includes contributors' data sets that enable readers who lack sophisticated statistics skills to move from theories about longitudinal data into practice.As the comprehensive reference, this "Handbook" has no direct competition as most books in this subject area are more narrowly specialized and are pitched at a high mathematical level. Contributors and subject areas are interdisciplinary to reach the broadest possible audience (i.e., psychology, epidemiology, and economics research fields). Summary material will be included for less sohisticated readers. Extensive coverage is provided of traditional advanced topics.

Focusing on personal knowledge and how it influences teacher development, this book follows one teacher, "Kay," from her years of teacher preparation through her time as a seasoned veteran. What emerges from this intense 10-year study is a more complete picture of teacher development that will help us to better prepare and support our pre- and inservice teachers. This book offers a holistic view of learning to teach that challenges traditional boundaries and provides insight into many important issues, such as the link between theory and practice, teacher retention, and how to get teachers to change timeworn pedagogical practices.

Amsterdam growth and health longitudinal study (AGAHLS) : a 23-year follow-up from teenager to adult about lifestyle and health
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and type 2 diabetes is reaching a global epidemic. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors and pharmacotherapies in relation to these cardiometabolic diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of these risk factors and drug therapies generally remain incompletely understood. Elucidating the underlying molecular effects would be essential for better understanding of the disease pathogenesis and also for discovering new therapeutic targets. Quantitative serum metabolomics, which allows for simultaneous quantification of multiple circulating metabolic measures, provides a hypothesis-free approach to systematically inspect the metabolic changes in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Metabolomics thus presents a valuable tool to study the detailed molecular effects of disease risk factors and drug therapies. However, current metabolomics studies are mostly conducted in small cross-sectional studies and the causal relations of the risk factors on the metabolic measures are generally unclear, providing limited public health impact. The present thesis serves as a proof-of-concept to illustrate that well-designed observational studies can be used to infer causality. With the exemplars of assessing molecular effects of two risk factors (body mass index and sex hormone-binding globulin) and two drug therapies (statins and oral contraceptives), the thesis demonstrates that an improved causal inference can be achieved in observational studies via the combination of multiple study designs, including cross-sectional, longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analysis. This robust study design approach together with metabolomics data can be also extended to study the molecular effects of other risk factors and drug therapies. With an improved molecular understanding of a wide range of risk factors and therapies, better understanding of disease pathogenesis is ensured.
