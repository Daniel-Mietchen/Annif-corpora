This book provides an overview of the basic concepts of large transverse momentum particle physics, with a focus on pQCD phenomena. It examines high-pT probes of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and will serve as a handbook for those working on RHIC and LHC data analyses. Starting with an introduction and review of the field, the authors look at basic observables and experimental techniques, concentrating on relativistic particle kinematics, before moving onto a discussion about the origins of high-pT physics. The main features of high-pT physics are placed within a historical context and the authors adopt an experimental outlook, highlighting the most important discoveries leading up to the foundation of modern QCD theory.

Development of MeV ion beam lithography technique for microfluidic applications
The increasing energy consumption of smart devices sets greater demands on traditional Li-Ion batteries. As the number of charge-discharge cycles is deemed to increase, monitoring battery capacity becomes of greater importance. The aim of this thesis was to contemplate how battery measurement and monitoring methods could be improved. Special areas of focus included precision development, as well as the evaluation of the suitability and practicality of monitoring methods for smart device use. The theoretical basis extended to battery monitoring related factors inherent in Li-Ion batteries. The prevailing Nokia Symbian device level performance served as the starting point. Through empirical measurements the present state was examined with an automatic testing system created for the purpose. In comparison, a selection of commercial off-the-shelf battery monitoring systems was measured. Vendors of these commercial solutions claimed superior performance and straightforward integration feasibility. High precision was claimed to be attainable only through careful battery characterization. Supporting results were found for the significance claim of battery characterization. Therefore, battery characterization requirements were further studied to accelerate the productization process. The company R&D component quality system was considered in the preparation of the technical results of this thesis. The normative study followed roughly the selected guidelines of ISO 15288:2002 Systems Engineering - System Life Cycle Processes.
