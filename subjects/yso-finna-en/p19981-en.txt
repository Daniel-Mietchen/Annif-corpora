Remote device control via Bluetooth and GSM
The objective was to take Anritsu Bluetooth Test Set MT8852A/ MT8850A in use and develop some meaningful exercises for the performance study of Bluetooth devices. This thesis was initially designed by Mr. Veijo Korhonen, Senior Lecturer, School of Engineering and Natural Resources, Oulu University of Applied Sciences, Finland and originally this project was planned for Nokia. To attain the performance measurements, we selected some test devices, from different manufacturers and different packages (EUT) and used Anritsu Bluetooth Test Set MT8852A and MT8850A together with BlueSuite Professional Software, BlueTest, LabView to find the characteristics of the devices in different test scenario and finally to analyze the performance with a graphical representation. The work involved studying the device theory and working out the principle of Bluetooth Test Set (Anritsu MT8852A/ MT8850A) and making it functional, developing a test setup and taking care of measurements using BlueSuite/LabView software analysis, verification of software simulation results and fine tuning of the test setup model according to the measurement results for better representation and finally demonstrating the characteristics found in Bluetooth EUTs and Bluetooth Test Set. The test results can be used for any further research about the characteristics of EUT’s and the performance of Bluetooth (RF performance) in indoor environments. The performance is mainly evaluated with a graphical representation of the EUT’s transmitting power quality, the demodulated received signal quality for different data packets and sizes, frequency deviation of the EUT’s transmitter. It is also possible to extend the analysis with some additional software and hardware tools to make a further study of the packet data flow by making a statistical analysis to find the behavior of the EUT’s with the change of distance, measuring the throughput and efficiency for different packet sizes and explore the security features and behavior of EUT’s in different network environment.

Abstract: The objective of this thesis was to study Qt/QML, NFC and Bluetooth technology, with the aim of investigating how data is transferred from low level NFC to QML application level. The knowledge gained was to be used to develop a QML-based application to demonstrate the local connectivity of Bluetooth and NFC. The target device was the Symbian phone for which Nokia 603 was selected in this project for demonstration purposes. The project was carried out in two parts first, the theoretical part and the practical part. The theoretical part entailed studying of Qt platform, QML language, NFC and Bluetooth tech-nologies. Qt and QML were used as the development environment and development lan-guage respectively. NFC was used to trigger the local connectivity and Bluetooth aided in the transfer of user input from one phone to the other and vice versa. The basic idea, which was the practical part, was demonstrated by developing a sample game that could be played by two players, data was transferred over Bluetooth and the connection was initiated by NFC. In the game data transfer was initiated by NFC that started the Bluetooth pairing and connection. The Bluetooth connection was then used to pass the data from one phone to another phone. The result of this thesis showed a successful local connection of NFC and Bluetooth using QML technology. This clarified Qt, QML, NFC and Bluetooth technologies in the different aspects and the development of a QML mobile application. The result showed that even a developer with the basic programming skills can easily study, develop and deploy applications in QML. It also shows that different technologies can be combined to come up with one working application. The game which was developed in this project gave a clear indi-cation that more intuitive applications and games could be developed using QML with NFC and Bluetooth technologies.
