Insect pollination of crops
The Business of Bees provided the first integrated account of diminishing bee populations, as well as other pollinators, from an interdisciplinary perspective. It explores the role of corporate responsibility and governance as they relate to this critical issue and examines what the impact will be on consumers, companies, stock markets and ultimately on global society if bee populations continue to decline at a dangerous rate. The book considers the issue of global bee population decline from a variety of disciplines, collecting the perspectives of academics in accounting, science and humanities, with those of practitioners in the finance industry. The chapters explore the impact of the rapid declines in pollinator populations on the natural world, on corporations, on the stock market and on accounting. The Business of Bees will be essential reading for those in academia, business and finance sectors and anyone invested in the future of our planet.

The business of bees : an integrated approach to bee decline and corporate responsibility
Summary: The study is based on counts and analyses of the pollen carried by insect visitors to the female flowers of cloudberry in Finnish Forest and Fell Lapland, and at Varangerbotn and Ekker√∂ya in Norwegian Finnmark. The best pollen-carriers were species of Apidae and Formicidae of Hymenoptera, and of Syrphidae, Muscidae...
