Genetic and molecular aspects of sports performance
This book examines how adolescence, menstruation and pregnancy were experienced or 'managed' by active women in Britain between 1930 and 1970, and how their athletic life-styles interacted with their working lives, marriage and motherhood. It explores the gendered barriers which have influenced women's sporting experiences. Women's lives have always been shaped by the socially and physically constructed life-cycle, and this is all the more apparent when we look at female exercise. Even self-proclaimed 'sporty' women have had to negotiate obstacles at various stages of their lives to try and maintain their athletic identity. So how did women overcome these obstacles to gain access to exercise in a time when the sportswoman was not an image society was wholly comfortable with? Oral history testimony and extensive archival research show how the physically and socially constructed female life-cycle shaped women's experiences of exercise and sport throughout these decades.

Combat at the castle
Abstract: In Finland, statistics show that the number of students from diverse cultures is increasing every year. Nursing students who study under the English Language Degree Taught Program (ELTDP) spend nearly half of their study program in clinical placements for their internship according to the European Union and nursing schools' directives. These  students need guidance and support from preceptors throughout their clinical placements. Our descriptive qualitative study was designed to explore the preceptors' experiences in precepting ELTDP nursing students in surgical clinical placements. We conducted semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions with four registered nurses from surgical wards within the Metropolitan region. Inductive content analysis was adapted in data analysis. Preceptors were aware of their role of precepting; teaching, motivating and supporting. Integrating ELTDP nursing students to the Finnish working culture and translation emerged as new roles for the preceptors. These were perceived to be confusing and time consuming due to the use of two languages simultaneously. In spite of that, preceptors were happy about meeting new people and the cultural enrichment that ELTDP nursing students brought with them. In addition, preceptors appreciated more support from nursing school teachers through consistent communication. They were of the opinion that they could get financial rewards for precepting and healthcare organizations (employers) could encourage all nurses to precept and allocate them time to attend the organized education sessions during their normal working time. In the future, the experiences of ELTDP nursing students' preceptors in Finnish healthcare organizations could be researched further.

This study explores dialogical mentoring and is part of a larger research project begun in 2009. It was designed and carried out in Finland, in the School of Vocational Teacher Education, a unit of the Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The empirical data were collected from mentors and mentees during the teacher practice period. Dialogical mentoring is a process where both novice and experienced teachers can learn something new. Dialogue involves the participants' willingness to put forward and share new ideas. This study attempts to clarify the main characteristics of true dialogical mentoring process in teaching practice. According to the findings, the main characteristics in mentoring the teaching practice are: equal encounter and mutual appreciation of competence, mutual learning and growth of competence.

Abstract: Ward managers play crucial roles in creating conducive learning environment for nursing students during their clinical practice. The purpose of our final project was to explore ward managers' view of the strategies for successful learning experiences for ELTDP (English Language Taught Degree Programme) nursing students in acute clinical practice settings in Finland. The study question was: What are the strategies that will enhance ELTDP nursing students clinical practice experience in acute settings in Finland? To answer these questions, five ward managers were interviewed and the data was analyzed through content analysis. The findings were summarized into three themes:(i)language; (ii)cultural competence; (iii) cooperation between educational institutions and clinical placements. Both ELTDP students' and tutor nurses' language skills need improvement for students to achieve successful learning outcomes; cultural competence was not well-discussed and formal training on this topic was missing in the wards; Cooperation between educational institutions and clinical placement need to be intensified to achieve successful clinical practice experience.

Objectives    This study aims to identify European radiographers' challenges in clinical performance in mammography and the main areas of mammography that require more and better training.      Methods    An extensive search was performed to identify relevant studies focused on clinical practice, education and training in mammography published between January 2010 and December 2015 in the English language. The data were analysed by using deductive thematic analysis.      Results    A total of 27 full text articles were read, evaluating their quality. Sixteen articles out of 27 were finally selected for this integrative review. The main challenges of radiographers' mammography education/training can be divided into three groups: training needs, challenges related to radiographers, and challenges related to the organization of education. The most common challenges of clinical performance in mammography among European radiographers involved technical performance, the quality of practices, and patient-centeredness.      Conclusions    The introduction of harmonized mammography guidelines across Europe may serve as an evidence-based tool to be implemented in practice and education. However, the variability in human and material resources as well as the different cultural contexts should be considered during this process.

Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of preceptors in mentoring English Language Taught Degree programme (ELTDP) international nursing students in clinical practice in medical setting. Five registered nurses (RNs) with minimum of three years' experience of preceptoring ELTDP international nursing students were interviewed. The interviews were digitally recorded and data from the interviews were transcribed verbatim then analyzed using inductive content analysis. There were four main categories that emerged from the data. The first was challenges/barriers to learning with generic categories such as communication, competency, lack of motivation, and stress and pressure. The second main category was profitable teaching style with generic categories: learning by doing, preceptor-preceptee relationship and motivation. The third and fourth main categories were external (nursing schools) and internal (wards) support respectively. Language skills, cultural differences, staff nurses' negative attitude towards students pose barriers to successful learning outcomes. Participants expressed that planning beforehand, creating a friendly environment for learning; assigning duties to students and open-mindedness are profitable teaching strategies. The need for preparatory courses for preceptors and more awareness of ELTDP international nursing students in the ward if a more successful learning outcome is to be achieved is recommended.

Temperature plays an important role in sports - regarding both the athlete's performance and health. However, until now, these effects, e.g. thermoregulatory mechanisms as well as the variations of body temperature during physical exertion have barely been considered. This book presents studies and results which prove that cold application has a positive influence on the athlete's performance and regeneration ability. Based on the results of international studies, and considering the control mechanisms and principles of thermoregulation, the effects of cold application should be utilized in training and competition.
