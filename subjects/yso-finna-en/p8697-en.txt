The topic of this final thesis was about improving material flow and information flow in inventory management at the Turku plant of Felix Abba. The objective of the thesis was to find solutions regarding the topic that do not require major financial investments. Logistics has a direct effect on customer satisfaction, the perceived value of products, operational costs, profit and just about every other measure of performance. Therefore, with the points brought up in this study, the company may be able to create a sustainable competitive advantage.  First, the company is introduced. It is followed by a literary research that covers important theoretical issues for the study. In the theoretical part the financial importance of logistics is emphasised. Furthermore, it includes information on warehousing and production controllability. The actual work carried out at the plant is presented after that. The first task was to find out what the current operations model is and what its black spots are. Many people who were involved at different processes were interviewed. The management of the plant had an active role in bringing up new subjects to look at. Several illustrative drawings were made regarding these subjects, which can be found in the Appendices. Based on the work an analysis was made in which black spots coming up in the final thesis are dealt in more detail. The analysis is followed by proposals for improvements.  As a result, a new operations model for the herring plant was introduced. At the vegetable plant, the capacity of the warehouse was increased by installing new pallet racks. Ultimately proposals for inter-warehouse transfers were suggested. Despite added capacity at the vegetable plant, the improvements have been planned to be executed during the upcoming summer.

There is clear evidence that higher quality produce fetches higher prices and simple post-harvest management practices can improve the quality of produce and increase farm income. In this regard, farmers can benefit greatly from advice and training in post-harvest management to maintain quality and add value to produce. This manual provides guidance on post-harvest management of food grains at the farm. It aims to guide extension workers on how to advise farmers in maintaining and adding value to the quality of their stored produce--Publisher's description.
