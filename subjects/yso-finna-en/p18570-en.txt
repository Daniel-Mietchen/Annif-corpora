In recent years, corporations of all sizes and orientations have become more sensitive to social issues and stakeholder concerns, and they are collectively striving to become better corporate citizens (in some cases, urged on by shareholder pressure or government regulations). The best practices in corporate sustainability are no longer the exclusive domain of companies like Ben & Jerry's or Body Shop as they were a decade ago; now, large, multi-national companies like G.E. and Wal-Mart are leading the way with significant financial and organizational commitments to social and environmental issues. To help managers and academics keep their eye on the ever-moving target of sustainability, award-winning author and academic Marc Epstein's provides an authoritative and comprehensive guide to implementing corporate sustainability initiatives and to measuring both their social and financial impacts.

Today greater responsibilities are being put on regions to shape their own future. Thus, different kinds of regional collaboration arenas have emerged and an increasing number of regional collaboration projects are now crossing both county and nation borders. The object of interest in this study is the Bothnian Arc project. This project involves municipalities on the Swedish and the Finnish side of the Gulf of Bothnia. The aim has been to analyse opinions and experiences of Swedish actors regarding the Bothnian Arc as a region-strengthening project. The article is based on interviews with fourteen municipality representatives and a questionnaire answered by approximately 300 firm managers within the Bothnian Arc area.The Bothnian Arc is essentially a political project and this study shows that the policy creating institutions have not succeeded in transferring ideas and objectives to firms within the area. In fact, only 30 per cent of the firm managers were familiar with the project. More concrete projects adapted to firm interests were required by a few of the municipality representatives. Moreover, the municipalities closest to the Finnish border are more active and involved both on municipal and firm level. This tendency is primarily due to already existing traditions of collaboration with Finnish actors.

Abstract: Strategic alliance is considered today as a natural and common alternative to employ when a firm plans to enter a new market with a stable and secure basis. In fact strategic alliance is more preferred entry option compared to acquisitions around the world across all industries. In alliances, like in all international operations there are risks, however many theorists as well as companies have understood the value of operating with a partner. Fira Oy (further referred to as 'Fira'), a construction firm in Finland has realised the potential in new markets and has decided to execute this prospect through strategic alliance with a local partner. Fira has done market research particularly in the Swedish market. It is a usual path for a Finnish company to expand its operations into the neighbouring economy. Alliances have been studied theoretically and practically for years, yet still no clear model for success exists. This research ties the theoretical points of view with practise together to advice Fira in entering a new market through strategic alliance. The framework for the research is organised in the following manner: Different theoretical strategic alliance modes are compared to find the most suitable for Fira and its operations. The second part of the research is to construct a partner profile by analysing the strategic and cultural characteristics of Fira. A cultural analysis is conducted to show the viewpoint of the employees toward Fira's company culture. From the results a partner culture fitting Fira is identified. The profile includes the strategic goals as well as the strategic capabilities the partner has to have. The strategic capabilities are discovered through a value chain analysis. Furthermore, the complementary capabilities to be performed by the partner for the alliance are determined. The final part of this research is risk in alliances. As mentioned above, there is risk in all international operations. In alliances companies often think it is reduced by half since the partner is responsible for half of the risk. However, risks often increase in other operational and environmental elements, making the risk factor one of the most significant factors to be considered when entering an alliance. The objective of this research is to construct a strategic alliance model for Fira, a construction business entering the Swedish market. The framework forms a basis for any international strategic alliance Fira considers to join in the future.

Abstract: The European Commission's social business initiative in terms of Finland : evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the social business initiative in relation to Finland's environment for social entrepreneurship. The objective of this paper is to investigate the environment for Social Entrepreneurship in Finland in terms of the European Commission's Social Business Initiative introduced in November 2011. The Social Business Initiative presents eleven key actions for creating a favourable environment for social enterprises. These key actions contain measures divided under funding, visibility and the legal environment for social enterprises. The intention of this thesis is to evaluate the Social Business Initiative and bring forth its biggest strengths and weaknesses within the context of the Finnish environment for social entrepreneurship. Qualitative research was conducted for the thesis including a semi-structured interview with the Head of Development of the Association for Finnish Work. The interview enabled the thesis to examine the situation of social entrepreneurship in Finland with deeper insight. Investigating reports – this including especially reports by the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy on social entrepreneurship – was also an essential part of the implemented research. Since the topic holds a strong interconnection to the European Commission, the stands and work of the Commission were also investigated. It was found that many of the measures introduced in the European Commission's Social Business Initiative such as funding through structural funds, introducing societal criteria in public procurement and strengthening EU community programmes could be and are especially useful for promoting social entrepreneurship in Finland and have already been quite well established. In turn, the key actions also show weaknesses in the applicability of introducing new legislation and the capabilities for introducing social criteria in public procurement. This paper will first present the concept and definition of social entrepreneurship in relation to the EU and in Finland, then explain the key actions of the Social Business Initiative and lastly tie this in with the context of the Finnish environment.

When it comes to perceptions of what is a sustainable economy and how it may be realised, companies expanding into Central and Eastern European markets face the challenge of diverse people, attitudes and history. Corporate Social Performance in Emerging Markets provides an effective tool for companies to help them engage in CSR activities and become a responsible company in CEE countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. It does this by enabling them to focus on the difference of stakeholders and their attitudes to those of Western Europe.The author, Zsofia Lakatos, provides a review of the major differences between the various CEE countries, supported by interview research from leading executives in some of the blue-chip companies already operating in the region.

As the era of ever expanding markets and ample resources ends, governments and business will have to behave differently. The world is facing weak economic growth, limits to affordable resources and increasing concerns about environmental consequences. During the boom times, governments championed de-regulation and business responded by adopting an anything-goes attitude. In these straitened times, strategic analysis has to engage with the challenges that society faces to create resilient corporations fit for the 21st century.In Corporate strategy in the Age of Responsibility, Peter McManners, who has for nine years run strategy workshops on the Henley MBA focusing on the global business environment, sets about providing a strategic framework for navigating the new economic environment. Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs) now exist, but they struggle to find the strategic rationale for the improvements they champion. The author argues that their good intentions often lack traction, partly because others in management don't get it, but also because they are not ambitious enough. The book is not about preaching semi-charitable behaviour or how to enhance the reputation of the corporation instead it is about surviving and thriving in a challenging and changing environment. A corporate audience familiar with strategy books will relate to this book, but will find it steers them towards radically new strategic thinking suitable for a turbulent period of transition.
