The aim of this thesis was to build a prototype model for the Archipelago electronic business project. The Archipelago project is a submitted business idea for the Central Baltic Intereg IV programme 2007 ? 2013 which is a European territorial co-operation programme funding cross-border projects in the central Baltic Sea area consisting of parts of Estonia, Finland (including Ålands), Latvia and Sweden. A literature review on different types and model of an electronic business in addition to some sample models analyses were conducted as part of this work. An electronic business prototype was needed for the design of an online business platform that could merge all business entities, especially small scale business into one big electronic business site to allow companies to make profit with less effort and to benefit from each other when allowing customers to identify, locate and use efficiently their needs. As result of this study, an idea of entity diagram of the companies and service providers were built alongside with a sample business model to help channel the exponential growth of the project. Designing an electronic business prototype would be a pillar and a blueprint for a flexible, scalable and controllable design for such a large electronic business environment. In addition, this prototype would prepare for design mistakes and help avoiding them.

The thrilling debut from comedy writer and stand up star, Will Smith - a novel about loneliness, about not belonging and about the corroding effects of keeping secrets. 'John le Carre meets 'Middlemarch' Independent Jersey 1987, and the storm clouds are gathering over Colin Bygate, a Mainlander married to an Islander. When he first arrived, he fell for the Island's heathered headlands and golden coves, its winding lanes and sweeping tides, its background hum of Frenchness. But now he strikes a dissonant note. Sitting on an outcrop stewing after a row with his wife, schoolteacher Colin spots one of his pupils near the edge of a cliff. Worried that the boy may have intended to jump, he drives him home, hoping that his gloomy imagination was playing tricks. But when the boy fails to turn up to school the next day, Colin feels duty-bound to track him down, pitting him against the Island establishment who would rather there was a little less noise around this particular absence. A web of characters is spun around this mystery, each with his or her own secrets. In Jersey, where everyone knows everyone else's business, you must become your own island.
