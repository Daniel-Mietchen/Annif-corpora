Analytical-numerical methods for finding hidden oscillations in dynamic systems
Complete wireless design
This thesis was part of a development program coordinated by the Finnish Defense Forces. This program includes several development projects for military communication systems.    The purpose of this thesis was to examine precise oscillators for ensuring the synchronization of communication systems. General oscillator techniques and theory were studied. This thesis deals with the oscillator technologies and the implementation of precise oscillator prototype.    The main design targets of the oscillator unit were high accuracy, compatibility with a tactical router, small size and usability. The oscillator unit can be used with a tactical router or as a stand-alone precise clock source. The prototype of an oscillator unit was planned, developed and tested in this project.    The oscillator unit includes a GPS synchronized precise atomic clock, a microcontroller, control logic and interface circuits. The oscillator unit has also interfaces for oscillator control and testing.    The chip scale atomic clock is a precise timing source. GPS system is the main timing source of the router. The oscillator acts as a secondary timing source of the tactical router. Further development ideas were presented in order to increase the performance of the oscillator unit. Key words: tactical router, oscillator, synchronization, timing.

Ultrasound is one form of sound wave which is used to measure, detect and examine different kind of applications. Even though there is an already existing industrially made ultrasonic transducer that uses a high frequency ultrasound; it is expensive to get one for a personal use. Learning how to use the Olympus made ultrasonic transducer was a preliminary process before the overall step. On the other hand, there is a relatively cheaper low frequency piezoelectric in the market. Studying and testing it helps to reveal whether it can be used as a substitute in-place of one of the ultrasonic transducerâ€™s application which is called Non Destructive Testing (NDT). It is this initial idea that the document addresses about. The property of low frequency ultrasound wave, generated by the piezoelectric (40 kHz - 300 kHz), in a metallic media is the core point. For this particular purpose six samples of piezoelectric (MCUSD18A40S09RS-30C, MCUSD13A300B09RS, MCUSR18A40B12RS MCUSD14A48S09RS-30C, MCUSD14A40S09RS-30C, MCUSD14A58S9RS-30C) were tested in different metallic media. The data collected from the experiment elaborates the analysis made in this study.
