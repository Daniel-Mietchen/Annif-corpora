Abstract: On-going change in film consumption - Is online availability disrupting the offline markets? The objective of this study was to look into the online film services in Finland and the theories connected to offering that type of online services. The aim was also to look into these services from the point of view of their disruptiveness to the market. A research was conducted to find out the current status of these online film distributors in Finland from the point of view of the customers. The research was mainly of quantitative nature and it was conducted as an online survey. The survey was answered by 123 people and in addition three persons were interviewed to gather more specific experiences and opinions on certain matters. The research revealed that most of the respondents would be willing to try online film services in the future but only few already had experience in using them. Currently more people seem to rather find films from illegal sources to download or prefer to watch them from DVD's or Blu-rays. The research also gave implications that purchasing content online is not a novelty for people anymore and what seems to keep people from using these online services are preconceptions on, for example, their quality and pricing.

The objective of the study is to explore the problem of marketing of contract based services in industrial B-to-B sector with a primary focus on the promotional part of the marketing mix. One intention is to research the marketing communication actions of the case company, as well as promotional activities of comparable contract services of other B-to-B companies. Another intention is to recommend how marketing communication actions for contract-based services could be improved in the case company to support sales activities of local ABBs units. The theoretical framework was based on the studies of contemporary marketing and service marketing theorists like Kotler, P., Gr√∂nroos, C., Jobber, D., Lovelock, C. and others. Also scientific articles of industrial services researchers Kumar, R. and Kumar, U. were used in the study. Industrial firms increasingly demand turnkey solutions and are willing to cooperate with a specific supplier in a single source relationship. For marketing communication activities of contract based services it is important to understand specific features of product offering, to understand customers' needs and buying behavior, and to make the right decisions on the marketing communication mix. The study was carried out in the form of qualitative research. Data was gathered through interviews with service sales managers from five European countries and service product managers from the global service business unit. The company's internal databases and public Internet pages served as a basis for a benchmark analysis. The results showed that on the European market needs of industrial customers located in different countries are very similar.  In communication of service contract the main message should carry the idea of providing customers with a feeling of security and the possibility to concentrate on the customer's core business. The results also suggested that the most common and effective way to sell contract-based services is face-to-face sales. Brochures, presentations, leaflets serve as additional tools for sales people to promote a service contract. To achieve other marketing promotional objectives, like increased service product awareness, customers' involvement, and built relationships with a community, other communication activities should be taken. Here digital marketing can be integrated into the traditional marketing communication mix. In order to respect the company's business secrets, chapters containing internal company's data and the improvement proposals on how to enhance the current marketing communication actions for service contracts in ABB are not included in the public version of the thesis.
