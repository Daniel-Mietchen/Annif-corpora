Chelating Agents for Land Decontamination Technologies examines the application of chelating agents for the treatment of soil contaminated with metals. Contaminated land remediation is a widespread and costly problem, and the traditional excavation-and-disposal treatment method is not a sustainable solution.  Chelating agents (organic compounds that can bind metal ions) are an attractive new technology for land decontamination, because chelating agents enhance metal extraction from contaminated soil or sediment and facilitate metal mobility in subsurface soils. Chapters in this book cover the process fundamentals as well as engineering applications and recent advances for the use of chelating agents in soil washing, soil flushing, phytoremediation, and electrokinetic remediation. They address the application of chelating agents for both ex situ and in situ soil remediation technologies. The extensive use of illustrations and summary tables is combined with up-to-date references. This compilation of engineering applications and research findings for different chelating agent–enhanced remediation technologies will be useful to environmental engineers, scientists, and decision makers regarding contaminated land remediation.

Environmental chemical analysis
Phyto presents the concepts of phytoremediation and phytotechnology in one comprehensive guide, illustrating when plants can be considered for the uptake, removal or mitigation of on-site pollutants. current scientific case studies are covered, highlighting the advantages and limitations of plant-based cleanup. Typical contaminant groups found in the built environment are explained, and plant lists for mitigation of specific contaminants are included where applicable. This is the first book to address the benefits of phytotechnologies from a design point of view, taking complex scientific terms and translating the research into an easy-to-understand reference book for those involved in creating planting solutions. Typically, phytotechnology planting techniques are currently employed post-site contamination to help clean up already contaminated soil by taking advantage of the positive effects that plants can have upon harmful toxins and chemicals. This book presents a new concept to create projective planting designs with preventative phytotechnology abilities, 'phytobuffering' where future pollution may be expected for particular site programs.--COVER.

Soil and water contamination : from molecular to catchment scale
"Written primarily as a textbook for upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, this book provides fundamental knowledge concerning the biological and health effects of pollutants on living systems. Also able to serve as a reference for professionals, the book stresses the chemical and biological characteristics of major pollutants found in the air, water, and soil, and their impacts on the health and wellbeing of humans, animals, and plants. This new edition is greatly expanded and updated, includes a color insert, and contains a new chapter on Occupational Toxicology"--Provided by publisher.
