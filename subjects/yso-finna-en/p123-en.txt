"If you are responsible for protecting your company's assets, then you know that risk assessment means more than simply identifying security vulnerabilities; it also means measuring their likelihood, prioritizing them, assessing their risk of occurrence, and measuring their impact on your organization's assets. Failure to consider all of these elements could constitute a violation of standard security industry practices. This valuable resource will help you develop the necessary strategies for conducting comprehensive risk assessments"--Publisher's website.
Summary.
"The 'Europeanisation' of the fight against crime is a broad and much-contested notion. This in-depth analysis of the role of the EU in fighting crime within the area of freedom, security and justice explores the impact of EU policies in the Member States, the progressive convergence of Member States' criminal law systems, the emergence of mutual recognition as an alternative to harmonization, and the incremental development of the ECJ's jurisdiction. The essays also explore the limitations inherent in EU counter-crime policies and the changes brought about by the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. These changes are discussed both collectively and within individual substantive areas in which the EU has taken an active role in fighting crime, such as corruption, money laundering, terrorism, organised crime and extradition"--
