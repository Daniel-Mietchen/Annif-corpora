"The Routledge Handbook of Disability Studies takes a multidisciplinary approach to disability and provides an authoritative and up-to-date overview of the main issues in the field around the world today. Adopting an international perspective and consisting entirely of newly commissioned chapters arranged thematically, it surveys the state of the discipline, examining emerging and cutting edge areas as well as core areas of contention. Divided in five sections, this comprehensive handbook covers: Different models and approaches to disability How key impairment groups have engaged with disability studies and the writings within the discipline Policy and legislation responses to disability studies and to disability activism Disability studies and its interaction with other disciplines, such as history, philosophy and science and technology studies Disability studies and different life experiences, examining how disability and disability studies intersects with ethnicity, sexuality, gender, childhood and ageing. Containing chapters from an international selection of leading scholars, this authoritative handbook is an invaluable reference for all academics, researchers and more advanced students in disability studies and associated disciplines such as sociology, health studies and social work"--Provided by publisher.

"The seventh edition of Occupational Therapy for Physical Dysfunction emphasizes four key themes that are essential to the best possible occupational therapy for adults with physical disabilities and to the future of the profession: Reliance on evidence/research to inform occupational therapy assessment and intervention - Occupation as the central intervention and outcome of occupational therapy services - Importance of expert activity analysis that synthesizes theoretical knowledge, clinical skills, and awareness of person and contextual factors to occupational therapy practice - Appreciation for the individuality, unique circumstances, and priorities of each patient/client These themes are evident in the book's organization, features, ancillaries, terminology, and authorship"--Provided by publisher.
