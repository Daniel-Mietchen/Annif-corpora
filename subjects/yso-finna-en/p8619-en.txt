Attempting to find solutions for small business complex challenges is not outrageously new either fresh research theme. Small business delivers a significant service and value both to the state and society through its initiatives, employment and taxes. The importance of a small and medium size enterprise in every local economy is huge - that is why so many studies and books are devoted to this sector. However, due to diversity and changeability of small business activity, new knowledge will always be in demand for this live and developing environment. Correspondingly, this particular research field – financial practice of a small internet-based enterprise - can be an inspiration for further studies and research, can give reasons to set and achieve many cognitive goals. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate, analyze and describe important finan-cial issues of small internet-based enterprise business activities. This thesis consists of six main parts. The second part, which follows the Introduction, defines the problem, maintains main questions and provides justification for the research. The third part analyses (i) current economic conditions and (ii) the actual situation in the narrower field of E-commerce. It also contains practical information about legal requirements of starting a business in Finland. The fourth part presents main financial issues of a small online business working internationally - including taxation and other particular financial details. The fifth part considers certain important financial aspects for an internet marketing startup, using details of an example internet marketing microcompany’s development and financial planning. Conclusion summarizes my final reflections and thoughts on the topic. The research is presented as a qualitative study. Data was collected mainly from government education and information web-based databases, government organizations’ websites, academic literature and specialized commercial organizations’ surveys. Data analysis follows the theoretical framework.
