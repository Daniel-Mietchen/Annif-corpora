Thousands of natural materials can produce glorious colour--the cochineal insect produces pink, maroon and purple, and more than 500 species of plants produce indigo blue. Now, in The Modern Natural Dyer, expert Kristine Vejar shares the most user-friendly techniques for dyeing at home with foraged and garden-raised dyestuffs as well as with natural dye extracts. Demystifying the "magic," Vejar explains in straightforward, easy-to-follow detail how to produce consistent, long-lasting colour. With stunning photography of the dyes themselves, the dyeing process, and 20 projects for home and wardrobe, The Modern Natural Dyer is a complete resource for aspiring and experienced dye artisans.

"The Pigment Compendium Dictionary" is a comprehensive information source for scientists, art historians, conservators and forensic specialists. Drawn together from extensive analytical research into the physical and chemical properties of pigments, this essential reference to pigment names and synonyms describes the inter-relationship of different names and terms. The Dictionary covers the field worldwide from pre-history to the present day, from rock art to interior decoration, from ethnography to contemporary art. Drawing on hundreds of hard-to-obtain documentary sources as well as modern scientific data each term is discussed in detail, giving both its context and composition. It includes a comprehensive list of pigment names and synonyms. It talks about the pigments used worldwide from pre-history to the present day. It contains information from hundreds of hard-to-obtain documentary sources.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the main quality traits in the parental lines of wheat segregating populations to identify the best for subsequent genetic mapping of the traits. Significant differences (p < 0.001) among wheat genotypes were observed. Many of the examined crosses appeared to be suitable for the purpose, showing differences among parental lines as high as 4.6% for protein content, 6.4% for gluten content, 69 for gluten index, 50 mL for sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation volume, and 33.9 g for thousand-kernel weight, whereas differences accounting for 4.8, 2.4, and 7.3 were observed for yellow index, red index and brown index, respectively. The results pointed out that for studying at the same time the quantitative and qualitative features of gluten, the wheat populations derived from Latino x MG29896 and Saragolla x 02-5B-318 could be particularly appropriate. In addition, the latter cross was suitable to deepen the knowledge of yellow index regulation.

"Natural Extracts as Food Flavors and Colorants, as its name implies, describes the natural extracts that are used as food flavors and colors. Part I addresses techniques and general characteristics of these natural extracts, including essential oils; solvent extraction; food colors; dispersion and solubitization; effect of heat; nutraceutical function; organoleptic function; and regulatory and analytical aspects. Part II focuses on each individual natural extract, with coverage including raw material; chemistry; extraction specifics; methods of testing; and uses. Chemical structure and properties of key constituents are provided. Wherever available, CAS number, FEMA number and E number are given. Determination of principal and significant constituents is described, so as to help analysts choose the right methods. Food scientists, researchers and product development professionals alike will find Natural Extracts as Food Flavors and Colorants an invaluable resource for understanding and using these natural food ingredients"--
