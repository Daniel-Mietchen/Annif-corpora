"Introducing creativity into the classroom is a challenge for governments and teachers. Employers around the world are increasingly interested in people who can think and work in a creative fashion. Families and Communities need people who are self-reliant, able to takes risks, to express and speak up for themselves and to be able to act independently. In recent years there has been a drive to make experiences at school more exciting, relevant, challenging and dynamic for all young people. Creative Approaches to Learning explores imaginative and creative ways to involve young people and children as stakeholders in their education. It looks at how they have actively participated in their own learning; transforming classrooms, curricula, school environments and teaching practices. Promoting reflection on current 'student-teacher-school' relationships, links between home and school and between school and the wider world, the contributions within this book illustrate how the active engagement of students can lead to greater confidence, self-reliance and risk-taking; skills essential for a successful post-school career. Through an exploration of students' current inclusion in school life, this book provides: - A study of key issues and debates surrounding student participation - Ideas for increasing student participation and motivation for learning - Case studies from a range of creative learning projects with analysis of their achievements and challenges - Guidance on the creation of active, relevant and effective pedagogies - Practical suggestions for reflective practice and CPD A functional, accessible guide to creatively increasing students' participation"-- Provided by publisher.
Routledge international handbook of participatory design
"Participatory Design is about the direct involvement of people in the co-design of the technologies they use. Its central concern is how collaborative design processes can be driven by the participation of the people affected by the technology designed. Embracing a diverse collection of principles and practices aimed at making technologies, tools, environments, businesses, and social institutions more responsive to human needs, the International Handbook of Participatory Design is a state-of-the-art reference handbook for the subject. The Handbook brings together a multidisciplinary and international group of highly recognized and experienced experts to present an authoritative overview of the field and its history and discuss contributions and challenges of the pivotal issues in Participatory Design, including heritage, ethics, ethnography, methods, tools and techniques and community involvement. The book also highlights three large-scale case studies which show how Participatory Design has been used to bring about outstanding changes in different organisations. The book shows why Participatory Design is an important, highly relevant and rewarding area for research and practice. It will be an invaluable resource for students, researchers, scholars and professionals in Participatory Design"--

The integration of digital technologies into urban life and environments has accelerated rapidly over the past few decades. It has been well established that this digital augmentation is changing the way we use and experience urban places; however, more studies, especially at the micro-level and from an architectural point of view, must be conducted in order to increase our understanding of the phenomenon.In this thesis, I examine the experience and evaluation of digitally augmented public urban places through four case studies, analysing participants' experiences of adaptive lighting pilots and urban displays deployed in real world settings. Digital augmentations were found to be able to alter the genius loci significantly; furthermore, findings from these case studies demonstrate and explain how co-design, existing use patterns and user groups in urban places, climate and weather, and sense of place affect digital augmentations.The thesis makes a methodological contribution in the form of evaluation probes. This method was developed by modifying the cultural probes method for the purposes of evaluative research of design artefacts. The proposed method allows for the emic evaluation of design artefacts without direct researcher presence. In other case studies, I have used ethnographically inspired methods to gather research materials.In analysing research materials I make a theoretical contribution by introducing the concept of emplacement into architectural research. This concept highlights the importance of place in our experience as embodied individuals. Based on my empirical results, I argue for the design of meaningful emplaced experiences through digital augmentation. I also chart the design challenges that have emerged from my studies, utilising them to develop a holistic model that aims to describe experiences of digital augmentation in public urban places.Overall, the thesis proposes participatory design evaluation as a new approach in the field of architecture. It refers to the examination and utilisation of research participants' intersubjective accounts in the evaluation of design artefacts from an experiential point of view. I argue for the benefits of this approach for the further inclusion of research knowledge in design and planning processes.
