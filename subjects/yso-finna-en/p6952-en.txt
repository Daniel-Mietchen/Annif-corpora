Offshore wind : a comprehensive guide to successful offshore wind farm installation
Wind turbine technology
Offshore wind is the new blue horizon for alternative energy. One small offshore wind farm can produce more power than a whole coal plant, or a nuclear reactor. However, very few people have real experience getting an offshore wind farm up and running. This book is the first-ever roadmap to successful offshore wind installation. It provides a ready reference for wind project managers, teaching them how to deal with complications on-site, as well as for financers, who can utilize the text as an easy guide to asking the pivotal questions of petitioning wind project developers, whose planning stages will be improved by the book's expert advice on how to avoid wasting money by scoping out and mitigating potential problems up-front. Wind turbine manufacturers will benefit from insights into design optimization to support cheaper installation and hauling, thereby incurring lower project costs, and helping developers establish a quicker route to profitability. The book sheds light not just on HOW to solve a particul installation difficulty, but delves into WHY the problem may best be solved in that way. Readers will learn not just how to build successful offshore wind farms, but how to do so in the most safe and economical way possible. Enables all stakeholders to achieve cheaper, faster and safer offshore wind project realization Explains the different approaches to executing on- and offshore projects, highlighting the economic impacts of the various financial and operational choices Provides practical, proven advice on how tough challenges can be overcome, using real-life examples from the author's experiences to illustrate key issues--
This comprehensive survey features over 140 striking illustrations that examine the history of wind turbine technology's association with coastal breezes and the current movement of locating wind turbines offshore.

"Modern wind turbines use advanced power electronics to provide efficient generator control and to ensure compatible operation with the power system. Wind Energy Generation describes the fundamental principles and modelling of the electrical generator and power electronic systems used in large wind turbines. It also discusses how they interact with the power system and the influence of wind turbines on power system operation and stability."--BOOK JACKET.

"This timely update provides detailed treatment of the integration of wind power into electrical power systems, including brand new material on offshore wind power farms and technologiesThis third English edition is based on new material from the fourth and fifth German editions (Windkraftanlagen: Systemauslegung, Netzintegration und Regelung, 5. Auflage, published by Teubner B.G. Gmbh, July 2009). It answers the question of how, with the proper control and direction, wind turbines can be made to operate more similarly to conventional power plants. The revised third edition addresses the engineering challenges of cost effective transmission and distribution of wind power, such as technical, economic and safety issues. It also incorporates all the recent technical developments in electrical power conversion systems and essential operating conditions, and includes unique, original research findings carried out by the author's own PhD and Masters students at Kassel University, Germany. This popular reference book has been updated to include new material from the fourth and fifth German editions, equating to 12.5% brand new material New material covers the 'hot topic' of grid connection for offshore wind farms and offshore technologies, including lots of illustrations Brand new material on low voltage fault dynamics and control of turbines Includes up-to-date coverage on completely new generator developments for wind turbines, developed over the past two years Illustrates how wind turbines can operate like conventional power plants using advanced control systems. Discusses the profitability of wind turbine integration in electrical power grids, and the environmental impact "--
Vertically and Horizontally Mounted Wind Mills : Wind Energy Production in Tampere University of Applied Sciences
Small scale energy production has become increasingly popular. Each production unit increases the energy independence of individual households, while the aggregate production of many units together decreases the burden on centralized energy production systems. Several technologies for small-scale energy production have been developed.  The aim of this thesis work was to produce English language material about small wind power production technology and the installation process for a small wind power unit in Finland. The thesis work discusses wind, windiness in Finland, and wind power production in theory, and goes through the installation steps.  The wind conditions in Finland are defined as adequate for small-scale wind power production, especially in the coastal and archipelago areas, as well as on fells and hills.  Also inland sites near an open water body or fields are good windy locations. Small wind power production units are commonly used in boats, summerhouses and remote locations, as well as to produce extra energy for housing. The sizing is scaled according to the given application for the wind power production unit, and the energy produced can be used to charge batteries or to produce heat and power. In the case of heat and power production, the system is connected to the common power grid.  A profitable investment in small wind power production requires a combination of selecting an optimal location, having accurate data on long-term wind conditions, calculating the optimum size of the unit, and having a long-lasting reliable small wind power production unit. However, it is impossible to calculate accurate costs or profitability of small wind energy production due to the variability of wind conditions and the fluctuating price of electricity in the grid. The investment costs of small-scale wind power production are high, so the initial investment can only be recouped by operating the production unit over a long period of time. After the expensive initial investments, wind energy is free of charge and naturally renewable despite the maintenance and repair costs. Furthermore, small wind energy production is often considered as a matter of principle for promoters of green energy.  Keywords: Small Wind Power Production, Wind Power, Micro production.
