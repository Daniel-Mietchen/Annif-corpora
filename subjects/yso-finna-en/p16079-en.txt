The time-traveling fashionista : a novel
Christian Dior achieved immortality with his first collection in 1947. His 'New Look' amazed the world as it emerged after wartime austerity, and reset the boundaries of modern elegance. Dior's search for the perfect line and the ideal silhouette has been celebrated by couturiers of the first rank: Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferre, John Galliano have all made their distinctive contribution. Now Raf Simons has made his mark with emphatic reference to the House's history. This book honours Dior's influence by celebrating the elements of style for every generation since 1947, through inspired pairings of classic and contemporary photographs. Six thematic chapters express outstanding Dior characteristics, including the silhouette, the evening gown and the eternal muse in short, the aspects of the House that lend it unique distinction both then and now. The most beautiful fashion plates from Dior's own time sit beside examples of the house's creations through the decades, including the latest by current designer-in-chief, Raf Simons. The resonance between classic archive photographs and the latest most up-to-date frames is clear and compelling.

From Poiret and Patou to Gernreich and Galliano, the sometimes provocative selection of 50 names poses stimulating questions about the definition of a fashion designer in the modern era.
