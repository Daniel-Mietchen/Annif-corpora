Abstract: The goal of this project was to develop an application that would integrate a calendar application with the social media, that is, Facebook. The main purpose of this application was to retrieve events from Facebook into the local calendar application and vice versa and also to fetch friends' birthday events into the calendar application. The functional part  mainly concerned the core study of the Facebook platform and developers' tools for both   Facebook and iPhone. The Facebook connect SDK (Software Development Kit) was identified as the key player   in the integration business which provided readymade code to embed into the Facebook   application that was created during the project in order to exchange information with   iPhone application, that is, the Student Calendar. The Graph API was found to be the core   of the Facebook Platform to enable developers to read from and write data into Facebook.   All the targets of the project were achieved although there were some complexities within the platform components. Nowadays, integrating applications with social networking sites are becoming popular  which is attracting more developers. In such a context, the application developed has a   great demand. This application can be useful for students and those who are fond of using   Facebook. The application has some important features of Facebook, such as a post-onwall, view news feed or checking a friend's birthday, so the user does not have to go   through the Facebook page for these functions. The procedures that were taken during the  application have been documented in detail, so the thesis can be used as a guide for   developers, and those who have interest in how integration is done can have a glance at it.

2013 : beginning an era of hope and harmony
"Examines 'the historical underpinnings of the sea change in the pictorial representation of calendrical time that took place in Hispanic Mesoamerica.' Discusses the deeply entrenched circular view of time in the West and the indigenous temporal representations in square or quadrangular form. The post-contact representation of time is thus an example of how fundamental native concepts were affected by the clash of cultures we call the Spanish conquest"--Provided by publisher.

Founding the year : Ovid's Fasti and the poetics of the Roman calendar
One of the most unusual decisions of the leaders of the French Revolution - and one that had immense practical as well as symbolic impact - was to abandon customarily accepted ways of calculating date and time to create a revolutionary calendar. The experiment lasted from 1793 to 1805 and prompted all sorts of questions about the nature of time, ways of measuring it, and its relationship to individual, community, communication and creative life. This study traces the course of the revolutionary calendar, from its cultural origins to its decline and fall. Tracing the parallel stories of the calendar and the literary genius of its creator, Sylvain Maréchal, from the Enlightenment to the Napoleonic era, Sanja Perovic reconsiders the status of the French Revolution as the purported 'origin' of modernity, the modern experience of time and the relationship between the imagination and political action.
