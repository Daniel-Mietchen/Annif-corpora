All librarians and libraries have information policies, and so do most people. The big issues, like censorship or intellectual property ownership and use, crowd our minds but the process of decision making is the same at every level and in every context, whether we are concerned with government secrets, advertising standards, or our children's reading and viewing habits. This book examines the issues from varying standpoints, including the human rights approach, the commercial approach, and the states-interest approach. These are all placed within the context of arguments about the public sphere. The working librarian has to be in a position to justify every stock purchase and information access decision, and in the strategies they follow to legitimate the library. The form and construction of arguments and the discussion of issues in this book will give librarians the context and arguments they need to identify and apply appropriate information policies and strategies. Key areas addressed in the book include: the information policy problem; policy sectors; information regimes; and, policies and strategies: models and cases. This book is essential reading for library students, researchers and policy makers as well as for all LIS practitioners wishing to widen their awareness of the important issues surrounding information policy.

Governing in the information age
"There is a clear need for a systematic, integrative, and rigorous normative theory of the information society. In this book, Duff offers a prescriptive theory to help to guide the academic and policy communities as they debate the future shape of emerging post-industrial, information-based societies. He argues that information policy needs to become anchored in a left-liberal philosophy which foregrounds a feasible permutation of the core ideals of freedom, equality and brotherhood. The information society, if it is to be worth having at all, cannot be allowed to be largely the outcome of the free play of market forces and technological determinism. The social structure, including the information economy, must be subjected to a regulatory axiological system as explicated by some leading proponents of social democracy"--
