Have you noticed that the moon sometimes seems to grow and shrink? Read and find out about the phases of the moon! With a simple experiment using an orange, a pencil, and a flashlight, you can see for yourself why the moon looks different at different times of the month.  Now rebranded with a new cover look, this classic picture book features rich vocabulary and simple diagrams. Both text and artwork were vetted for accuracy by an expert.  This is a Level 2 Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science title, which means the book explores more challenging concepts for children in the primary grades and supports the Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, and the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) standards. Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science is the winner of the American Association for the Advancement of Science/Subaru Science Books & Films Prize for Outstanding Science Series.
