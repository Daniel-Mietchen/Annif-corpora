horse
When Anna's mum Kerry gets sick and faces big hospital bills, her dad Rex says they need to sell off their most valuable horses. Anna knows her own horse Blue Moon is the best on the ranch, and so she and her best friend Lee hide him in an abandoned barn. Rex is horrified that Anna would ever think he would sell the horse but when they go to retrieve Blue Moon, the horse is gone. Particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant and dyslexic readers aged 8+ / Libris.
