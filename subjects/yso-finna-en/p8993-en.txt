A swedish man-of-war in Dutch waters : an archaeological field evaluation of the wreck of the Sophia Albertina
From the building of the ship to recovering object's from Titanic's watery grave, the fascinating story of Titanic is explored in detail. The largest ocean liner of her time, Titanic was hailed as the ultimate in luxury travel, with grand dining halls and the latest technology, including an onboard telephone system. She set off on her maiden voyage on 10 April 1912 with more than 2,000 people on board. Just four days later, the ship struck an iceberg off the coast of Canada, and the unthinkable happened: Titanic sank. Find out what caused more than 1,000 people to drown and why the ship was so woefully ill-equipped for such a disaster. Through eyewitness accounts and from evidence found in the wreck, Titanic's fateful voyage has been meticulously pieced together to tell a riveting story of ambition, arrogance and folly. Ages 7+

Although the popular myth of Cornish wrecking is well-known within British culture, this book is the first comprehensive, systematic inquiry to separate out the layers of myth from the actual practices. Weaving in legal, social and cultural history, it traces the development of wreck law - the right to salvage goods washed on shore - and explores the responses of a coastal populace who found their customary practices increasingly outside the law, especially as local individual rights were being curtailed and the role of centralised authority asserted. This groundbreaking study also considers the myths surrounding wrecking, showing how these developed over time, and how moral attitudes towards wrecking changed. Overall, the picture of evil wreckers deliberately luring ships onto the rocks is dispelled, to be replaced by a detailed picture of a coastal populace - poor and gentry alike - who were involved in a multi-faceted, sophisticated coastal practice and who had their own complex popular beliefs about the harvest and salvage of goods washing ashore from shipwreck. --Publisher's description.
