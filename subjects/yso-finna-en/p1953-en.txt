"Because of the recent explosion of interdisciplinary research in renewable polymers, the knowledge base is scattered and it is now timely to have an overview from a respected chemist and successful author. The book focuses on biopolymers as well as low molecular compounds that can be synthesized from renewable polymers. After introducing general aspects of the field, the subsequent chapters then look at the chemistry of biodegradable polymeric types sorted by their chemical compounds, including the synthesis of low molecular compounds. The factors influencing degradation and biodegradation of polymers for food packaging in various environments is detailed at length. The medical applications covered concentrate on controlled drug delivery, temporary prostheses, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. The author then turns his attention to renewable resources for fabricating biofuels and argues for localized biorefineries as biomass feedstocks are more efficiently handled locally"--

One of the problems when welding small plastic parts is to combine a strong welding seam with low costs. Product designs have become more and more varied and difficult to produce. Strong welding seam is a safety issue, so when the products are more complicated in shape, it is more challenging to produce safe products. However, technical problems and safety limits are always there and designers try to come up with workarounds for them and design modern and good looking products for customers. The primary aim of this thesis project was to compare two different welding joint designs for mass production. The material used for the samples was polycarbonate. Another purpose of the thesis was to compare the standard pneumatic ultrasonic welding to the servo-driven ultrasonic welding as well as to find out the benefits of the new technology in production. In this thesis, the main parameters and functions of ultrasonic welding machine are introduced. The thesis also presents the material selection and welding joint designs. For the purposes of this project, several samples were welded with both machines. Furthermore, rip-off tests for a part of samples were performed before the ageing treatment in order to define the reference rip-off force and to later indicate the rip-off force loss. All results were analyzed by using statistical software. The results of the experiments indicated that the shear joint is a stronger joint design than the energy director joint for welding small plastic parts. They also showed that the servo-driven welding machine can be more accurate and precise than the standard pneumatic welding machine. The results are significant as regards product design and quality.
