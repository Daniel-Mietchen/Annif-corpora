Cognitive therapy across the lifespan
"The psychological impact of dealing with the stress of the daily management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be arduous and challenging. Yet this area is rarely discussed in medical settings despite the fact that the emotional context can undermine the person's ability to stay motivated in the essential self-care tasks that are vital for good health.Diabetes and Wellbeing presents a range of research-based psychological principles that have been demonstrated to positively impact emotional wellbeing. It covers a broad spectrum of diabetes care from managing the initial diagnosis, overcoming depression and diabetes 'burnout', dealing effectively with fears and anxiety, managing food and weight issues and eating disorders, coping with the impact of sexual difficulties, and communicating with healthcare professionals.Jen Nash effectively guides the reader through strategies for better management of the issues associated with living with diabetes, moving individuals towards greater physical and psychological wellbeing and - as a result - a healthier future. This innovative yet practical guide is invaluable for individuals living with diabetes, those supporting others with diabetes, and healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with diabetes"--

Cognitive therapy, a core approach within a collection of psychotherapeutic techniques known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is fundamentally about changing peoples' thoughts--helping them overcome difficulties by recognizing and changing dysfunctional thinking styles. Among other strategies, it requires encouraging the development of skills for rehearsing new habits of thought, modifying biases in judging and interpreting social and emotional information, and for testing assumptions underlying dysfunctional and negative, distorted thinking. In How and Why Thoughts Change, Dr. Ian Evans discusses all these topics and more.--
