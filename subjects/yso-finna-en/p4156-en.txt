Understanding Asperger Syndrome can be a real challenge, more so than ever for busy teachers and teaching assistants who simply don't have the time to plough through the wealth of complicated literature available on the subject. This accessible, short and snappy guide to the basics will provide anyone working in an inclusive classroom with everything they need to know to make their job easier, and to make a real difference to any AS student in their care. The book consists of practical advice, and begins by looking at how children with AS operate and the implications this has for mainstream school settings. It goes on to give practical advice for one-on-one working, DIY resources for visual learners, tools for effective assessment, and much more. Information on how personal wellbeing can be maintained in potentially stressful situations is also included, and the concise chapters are ideal for busy TAs to dip into as and when they are in need of inspiration.
