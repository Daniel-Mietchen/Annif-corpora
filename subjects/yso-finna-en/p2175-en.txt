In praise of copying
The purpose of this thesis was to examine what would be the best combination of techniques to be used as a backup routine in a test environment with a predefined configuration. The study focused on the backup copying techniques, empirically testing of the properties of different techniques and on making conclusions based on the results of the tests. The study was carried out as a commission for a company. The research was carried out by first studying the theory of backup copying from previous researches. The second phase was to perform a series of empirical tests in the test environment setup by the employer. According to the tests, the differential incremental model should be favored over cumulative incremental model when backing up the researched environment. Based on the results differential incremental model with frequent full backups is very well suited for environments where most of the data changes regularly. The study concludes that running differential incremental backups with a reasonable cycle of full backups allows a good performance, efficient usage of storage and fast restores in case of disasters.

Digital rights management
"Are intellectual property rights a threat to autonomy, global justice, indigenous rights, access to lifesaving knowledge and medicines? The essays in this volume examine the justification of patents, copyrights and trademarks in light of the political and moral controversy over TRIPS (the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). Written by a distinguished international group of experts, this book draws on the latest philosophical work on autonomy, equality, property ownership and human rights in order to explore the moral, political and economic implications of property rights in ideas. Written with an interdisciplinary audience in mind, these essays introduce readers to the latest debates in the philosophy of intellectual property, whether their interests are in the restrictions that copyright places on the reproduction of music and printed words or in the morality and legality of patenting human genes, essential medicines or traditional knowledge"--
