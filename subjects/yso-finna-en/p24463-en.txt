In this thesis, the influence of reversion and recrystallization annealing on microstructure and mechanical properties was studied in metastable austenitic low-Ni high-Mn stainless steels, some alloyed with up to 0.45 wt.% Nb. Further, the effect of the various microstructures created by reversion and recrystallization on strain-induced martensite transformation in tensile testing was investigated. The aim was to achieve excellent combinations of strength and ductility in the steels and to improve understanding of the behaviour of ultrafine-grained austenitic stainless steels during deformation. All the steels were cold-rolled up to 60% thickness reduction producing up to 60% strain-induced α'-martensite in the austenitic structure. Annealing was carried out using a Gleeble thermomechanical simulator between 450–1100 °C for durations of 0.1–1000 s. The resultant microstructures were examined using different research equipment and methods. Regardless of the amount of Nb alloying, shear- and diffusion-controlled reversion could be completed by annealing at 700 °C, although at this temperature no recrystallization of the untransformed cold-rolled austenite occurred. At 800 °C, however, the cold-rolled austenite recrystallized, producing a non-uniform grain structure comprising ultrafine-grained areas formed via reversion and coarser ones formed by recrystallization of the retained austenite. At 900 °C, a uniform fine austenite grain size of about 2 μm was obtained. At higher annealing temperatures of 1000–1100 °C, normal grain growth of fine grains took place during prolonged annealing in steel with no Nb. However, grain growth was effectively retarded by alloying with 0.28 wt.% Nb. The non-uniform structures consisting of reverted and retained austenite exhibited excellent combinations of yield strength and uniform elongation. The results also showed that tensile strain-induced martensite nucleation sites and α'-martensite formation vary in a complex way depending on grain size.

"This book is the first of its kind to collectively address design-based and mechanical micro-manufacturing topics in one place. It focuses on design and materials selection, as well as the manufacturing of micro-products using mechanical-based micro-manufacturing process technologies. After addressing the fundamentals and non-metallic-based micro-manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry, it goes on to address specific metallic-based micro-manufacturing processes, such as: micro-forming, micro-machining, micro-molding, micro-laser processing, micro-layered manufacturing, micro-joining, micro-assembly and materials handling, and microEDM and ECM. The book provides an in-depth understanding of materials behavior at micro-scales and under different micro-scale processing conditions, while also including a wide variety of emerging micro-scale manufacturing issues and examples"--

The effect of austenite pancaking in the non-recrystallisation regime on microstructure and mechanical properties, especially bendability, was investigated in direct-quenched ultrahigh-strength strip steels with martensitic-bainitic microstructures.Lowering the finishing rolling temperature (FRT) increased total reduction in the non-recrystallisation region (R tot). Niobium microalloying increased Rtot while variations in C, Mn and Mo did not affect Rtot to the same extent as Nb. A decrease in the FRT increased the incidence of softer microstructures such as ferrite and granular bainite in the subsurface layers. The microstructures at the centreline were comprised of auto-tempered martensite with some bainite. An increase in Rtot strengthens the intensities of the ~{554}<225>α and ~{112}<110>α texture components at the centreline and the components ~{112}<111>α and ~{110}<112>α - {110}<111>α at the strip subsurface.Bendability is poorer with the bend axis perpendicular rather than parallel to the rolling direction (RD) and is further impaired with increasing hardness below the sheet surface. An intense ~{112}<111>α shear texture combined with upper bainite containing MA islands in the subsurface region is shown to be detrimental to bendability when the bend axis is perpendicular to the RD. This anisotropy of bendability can be explained by the appearance of geometric softening in grain clusters belonging to this texture component when the bend axis is perpendicular to the RD. Shear localisation is prevented, however, by the presence of a sufficiently thick subsurface microstructure having adequate work hardening capacity, i.e., ferrite + granular bainite rather than ferrite + upper bainite. The strain required to initiate strain localisation can be increased and good bendability thereby achieved—even in the presence of detrimental texture components—by ensuring thepresence of a sufficiently soft subsurface layer extending to a depth of approximately 5% of the total sheet thickness.The above beneficial microstructures can be obtained and good bendability ensured in direct-quenched strip steel with a yield stress above 900 MPa together with good impact toughness, provided a suitable combination of chemical composition and processing parameters is selected and sufficient attention is paid to steelmaking operations to obtain a proper inclusion structure.

Benefits of atomic layer deposition in nanophotonic device fabrication
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are ubiquitous and bioaccumulative man-made chemicals, resistant to chemical, biological and photolytic degradation and widely distributed to sediments, wildlife, and human. Many of these chemicals have adverse effects on a variety of targets, including the endocrine system, organogenesis and reproduction. Due to these effects and wide distribution, many of them are either banned or strictly controlled. However, because of persistency, they continue to interact with organisms globally.Despite the existing knowledge of the adverse effects of POPs, the effects of many chemicals on bone tissue are still poorly known. In the present study, we investigated the adverse effects of three common POPs, including tributyltin (TBT), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on the skeletal system. In vitro models were used to study the effects of PFOA in mouse and in human, and the co-effects of TBT and TCDD on differentiating osteoblasts and osteoclasts of mice. An in vivo model for mice was used to study the developmental effects of maternal PFOA-exposure on pups among with morphometrical and biomechanical property analyses. Mass-spectrometry was used to study the presence of PFOA in bones both in mice and in human, the latter acquired from the bone bank held in the Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The bones were also analyzed with cone beam computer tomography and microcomputer tomography.The results show that PFOA exposure in utero and during lactation leads to the accumulation of PFOA in bone, traceable even 17 months after exposure. PFOA exposure decreased the mineral density of the tibias and increased the medullary area. Nearly all of the human samples contained PFAS, including PFOA. PFOA also disturbed the differentiation of osteoblasts and with lower doses, increased bone resorption of osteoclasts both in mouse and human, the phenomenon being slightly stronger in mice. Co-exposure to TBT and TCDD led to decreased differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclast, and the co-effect was partially synergistic in osteoblasts.These results show disruption of bone development, bone cell differentiation, and PFAS accumulation in bone. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the co-effects of different POPs and the possible effects of long-term accumulation of POPs in bone and other tissues.
