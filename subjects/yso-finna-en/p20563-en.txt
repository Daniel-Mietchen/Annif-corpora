Abstract.
There is ongoing concern as to whether ethnic communities in Great Britain are becoming increasingly spatially segregated. This paper uses data from the 2001 Census of Population to explore the relationship between ethnic net migration and ethnic population concentration in London, the capital city and main location of ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest that migration is acting as an agent of dispersal of non-White populations from areas of high ethnic concentration to areas of low ethnic concentration, whereas White migrants are leaving areas where they are underrepresented and moving to areas of over-representation..

The management of ethnic diversity has become a topical and often controversial subject in recent times, with much debate surrounding multiculturalism as a systematic and comprehensive response for dealing with ethnic diversity. This book engages with these debates, examining the tangible outcomes of multiculturalism as a policy and philosophy in a range of traditional and 'newer' multi-ethnic nations. Exploring the questions of whether multiculturalism can promote 'ethnic harmony', employment equity and trust between various minority and non-minority groups, Managing Ethnic Diversity also adopts a comparative perspective on the experiences of multiculturalism in various international contexts, in order to examine whether lessons learned from some jurisdictions can be applied to others. With an international team of experts presenting the latest research from the UK, North America, Europe, China and Australasia, a truly global dialogue is fostered with regard to the utility and limits of multiculturalism in local and comparative contexts.
