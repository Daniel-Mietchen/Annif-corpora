"Ornamental grasses have been used in gardens for hundreds of years yet still they have not fulfilled their potential. Many gardeners know little about their care, use, and attractions. This lavish book contains the essential information needed to grow grasses successfully. It offers detailed information on the family of plants that make up ornamental grasses and advice on their growth habits, answering such questions as Do they form clumps or run? Can they self-seed? It also is rich in ideas for using grasses to best effect: borders, containers, naturalistic planting, and one-species block planting. A selection of the best grasses available is detailed, including their heights, spread, and hardiness; a description of their foliage and features; essential information on their care and maintenance; and advice on tackling the few pest and disease problems they have."--Publisher's description.
