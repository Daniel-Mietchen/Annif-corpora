The Cambridge companion to the Cistercian order
Consultation and political culture : essays on the case of Finland
This volume presents the composite character of the Cistercian Order in its unity and diversity, detailing the white monks' history from the Middle Ages to the present day. It charts the geographical spread of the Order from Burgundy to the peripheries of medieval Europe, examining key topics such as convents, liturgy, art, agriculture, spiritual life and education, providing an insight into Bernard of Clairvaux's life, work and sense of self, as well as the lives of other key Cistercian figures. This Companion offers an accessible synthesis of contemporary scholarship on the Order's interaction with the extramural world and its participation in, and contribution to, the cultural, economical and political climate of medieval Europe and beyond. The discussion contributes to the history of religious orders, and will be useful to those studying the twelfth-century renaissance, the apostolic movement and the role of religious life in medieval society.

Transforming female identities : women's organizational forms in West Africa
Due to the past decade's increasing impact of civil society networks and campaigns on global policy, the transnational civil society has become a continually emerging phenomenon. ""Transnational Civil Society: An Introduction"" provides a clear and accessible introduction to the history, characteristics, and achievements of influential transnational civil society networks, coalitions, and movements. Providing perspectives from both developing and industrialized countries, editors Srilatha Batliwala and L. David Brown create the impetus for an in-depth analysis of the forces that have shaped social movements such as globalism, economic and political power structures, and organization by non-state actors. The contributors are globally experienced activist-scholars and reflective practitioners presently engaged in these issues. Together these sources form a comprehensive introduction to civil transnationalism through the synthesis of diverse positions as the contributors raise ideas and discussion on social transformation. For students, practitioners, and activist alike, ""Transnational Civil Society: An Introduction"" offers comprehensible descriptions of transnational initiatives working toward effective and sustainable solutions to problems involving the environment, human rights, women's rights, and economic justice.

Communication culture in German work community
Advances in nonprofit marketing : a research annual. Vol. 3
As background information for this thesis I would point out my own personal interest in Germany as a country and as a possible future country where I would like to work. For my thesis I contacted the Göethe Institute (based in Finland) and the DFG (Deutsch-Finnische Geschellschaft), who both agreed to be involved in my thesis process. The Göethe Institute agreed to do interviews and DFG to send their members a questionnaire. (DFG is based in Germany; its members are mostly Germans and Finns.) My goal was to find out what the communication culture in German companies is like. I wanted to analyse how foreigners adapt to the German working community, what their difficulties are and what is different, for example, in relation to the work community in Finland. I also wanted to look at how they see the German communication culture within the work community, and some of both its negative and positive aspects. At the beginning of my thesis I wanted to give a bit deeper image and view of Germany as a country overall, a brief history about how it has developed in recent years, how the financial life in Germany is today, how many foreigners Germany has and something about the history of foreigners in Germany. I'm also interested in stereotypes regarding Germans in the eyes of other nationalities, how accurate they might actually be and how things really are when different cultures meet in business life. As many of the respondents to my questionnaire were women, I also wanted to do a bit of research on the overall position of women in German working life.
