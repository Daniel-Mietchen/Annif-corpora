Abstract: This thesis was motivated by my professional interest in Enterprise Application Software (EAS). Before I would be able to address the subject of my interest I needed to build a framework that could be used for the thesis.  The goal of this thesis was to create a framework which can be used to analyze the applicability of EAS for different industries by certain applicability criteria. There are so many different EAS today for each software category that companies and organizations struggle during software acquisition processes with the challenge to determine the best candidate to their particular business. This thesis aimed to analyze the factors to be considered be-fore and during the evaluation of the acquisition options.  The theoretical part of this thesis was built to separately determine the software and in-dustry categories and applicability criteria. The theory on software consists of Business Intelligence (BI), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Database and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The theory on industries covers the banking, manufacturing and telecommunications industries where telecommunications is considered as a service pro-vider.  When the framework was finished it was utilized to perform an applicability analysis with it. The analysis was focused on every software category at a time. Every software catego-ry was analyzed for every industry by the chosen applicability criteria. The analysis led to conclusions on how to weigh different evaluation factors during the acquisition process.
