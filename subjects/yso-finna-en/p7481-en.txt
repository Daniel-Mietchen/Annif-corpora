As teachers around the world deal with the challenges of inclusive education, they must endeavour to find effective ways of enhancing their classroom teaching methods. What Really Works in Special and Inclusive Education presents special educational needs teachers with a range of evidence-based strategies they can immediately put into practice in their classrooms. This unique book will be invaluable to any teacher in the field with neither the time nor the inclination to engage with theory-heavy research, but with a desire to ensure that their teaching strategies are up-to-the-minute and proven to be the most effective best practices. Each of the 26 strategies that this book comprises has a substantial research base, a strong theoretical rationale and clear guidelines on their implementation, as well as cautionary advice where necessary. In this new second edition, David Mitchell, a leading writer in special and inclusive education, continues to break new ground with revised and updated strategies based on evidence from the most recent studies in the field. From the myriad of related research available, only those studies with genuine potential for improving the practices of teachers and schools have been included, with the aim of facilitating practitioners in providing high-quality learning and social outcomes for all. Updates to this new edition include: An even wider international focus, including evidence drawn from the Far East New chapters on Response to Intervention, School-wide strategies, and the Finnish Education System A new companion website, with extra case studies and links to further reading, journal articles and video For anyone with a vocational or academic interest in evidence-based special educational needs teaching strategies – whether student or qualified classroom teacher, teacher trainer, educational psychologist, special needs coordinator, consultant or researcher – this book will be essential reading.
Strengthening media literacy : Know-how-talkoot as a pedagogic model
Cooperative procedures in learning
The present research deals with the curriculum development process realized in the practical nurse  education in Oulu Diakonia College. The curriculum has been developed since the middle of the 1990s into a  competence-based curriculum. The process has been spurred by the necessity to produce exams and knowledge to  meet the needs of work life. The purpose was to design a program which included compulsory entrepreneurship  education. It was implemented through cooperative learning and planning processes among the teaching staff.  When preparing the new theme, the staff and students were engaged in the process. The teachers defined and  shared common aims, defined their mental models, assessed their personal competences and decided what to learn  more. They used team work to share the ideas and conceptions. They examined their plans to make them conform  to those of the foundation (ODI). They brought their conceptions and experiential knowledge to their joint efforts.  The students evaluated the changes.  In the beginning the staff members had diverse attitudes to the change: some understood its importance at  once, others needed more time for it. The process resulted in transformative learning experiences: both the staff  members and the school organization were changed. The students valued the entrepreneurship education high, and  many of them chose optional entrepreneurship courses in addition to the compulsory ones.
