This text provides a thorough exposition of the traditional and the "modern" micro-theory. It concentrates on the models of behaviour of the basic economic units, consumers and producers. The main emphasis is on "oligopoly", which is the typical market structure of the modern industrial world. In addition, this second edition includes a third part covering the three important topics of the theory of factor pricing, general equilibrium theory and welfare theory. The new edition thus covers all the topics usually included in textbooks on price theory. The book is written at an intermediate level and is designed for undergraduate micro-theory courses. In addition, postgraduate courses in which micro-theory is taught at not too specialized a level could make use of the text. The author has adopted the verbal approach, with extensive use of diagrams to illustrate the verbal exposition. Mathematical proofs (where necessary) are presented in footnotes, or, when in the text, they are printed in small print so as not to interrupt the main theme.

Biochar application is a promising strategy for sequestering carbon in agricultural soils and for improving degraded soils. Nonetheless, contradictory and unsettled issues remain. This study investigates whether biochar influences the soil microbial biomass and community structure using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. We monitored the effects of four different types of biochar on the soil microbial communities in three temperate soils of Austria over several months. A greenhouse experiment and two field experiments were conducted. The biochar application did not significantly increase or decrease the microbial biomass. Only the addition of vineyard pruning biochar pyrolysed at 400Â°C caused microbial biomass to increase in the greenhouse experiment. The biochar treatments however caused shifts in microbial communities (visualized by principal component analysis). We concluded that the shifts in the microbial community structure are an indirect rather than a direct effect and depend on soil conditions and nutrient status.

"Intermediate Microeconomics: A Tool-Building Approach is a clear and concise, calculus-based exposition of current microeconomic theory essential for students pursuing degrees in Economics or Business. This beautifully-presented and accessible text covers all the essential topics that are typically required at the intermediate level, from consumer and producer theory to market structure (perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly). Topics covered include risk, game theory, general equilibrium and externalities, asymmetric information, and public goods. Using numerical examples as well as sophisticated and carefully designed exercises, the book aims to teach microeconomic theory via a process of learning-by-doing. When there is a skill to be acquired, a list of steps outlining the procedure is provided, followed by an example to illustrate how this procedure is carried out. Once the procedure has been learned, students will be able to solve similar problems and be well on their way to mastering the skills needed for future study.Intermediate Microeconomics presents a tremendous amount of material in a concise way, without sacrificing rigor, clarity or exposition. Through use of this text, students will acquire both the analytical toolkit and theoretical foundations necessary in order to take upper-level courses in industrial organization, international trade, public finance and other field courses".

"This book brings together two sets of development questions usually considered separately: the affective investments in humanitarian and development aid and the latter's use of visual representation and digital media. The author interweaves analysis of both to directly address young people's investments in charitable giving, mediated through websites and tours. Using the example of microfinance - the inclusion of the world's poor people into formal financial services - this book analyzes how the participation of financial inclusion supporters in global poverty alleviation efforts is shaped by affective sentiments, relationships and collectivities".
