J. G. Ballard's compelling and unnerving tale of what happens when life in a luxury apartment building descends into chaos. 'Later, as he sat on his balcony eating the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months.' Within the walls of an elegant forty-storey high-rise, the affluent tenants are hell-bent on an orgy of destruction. Cocktail parties degenerate into marauding attacks on 'enemy' floors, and the once-luxurious amenities become an arena for mayhem. In this visionary novel, the veneer of civilised society is stripped away as the inhabitants of the high-rise, driven by primal urges, create a dystopian world ruled by intimidation and violence.

Due to the lack of energy resources, European governments have started to establish new legislation a few years ago. In its turn, Ministry of Environment of Finland published a new guide for the calculation of linear thermal transmittance in April 2012, which is the main feature of thermal bridges in buildings that lead to significant heat losses. The aim of this thesis work is to make an analysis of thermal bridging in a high-rise building, determine the importance of linear thermal bridges on the total heat loss of the building and compare particular values of linear thermal transmittances with tabulated values given in National Building Code D5, in order to answer the question of their reliability and quality of design of joints. As well, the current work should help students and engineers, who do not speak Finnish, to use the guide mentioned above. Determination of linear thermal transmittance is possible by applying different methods described in ISO 14683. Nevertheless, in the current work the results were achieved by numerical calculation, which typically gives an accuracy from 0 to 5 % instead of the accuracy of reference tables from 0 to 50%. The survey was carried out in accordance with the international and Finnish standards. For computer simulation, COMSOL Multiphysics software was chosen. Finally, the evaluated linear thermal transmittance had an absolute difference from 17 up to 200% with the tabulated values. The heat losses due to linear thermal bridges took 13% of the value of total heat losses of the building. These results show the importance of the current study and obligation of obtaining of linear thermal transmittances and heat losses of thermal bridges, as their sizes are comparable with heat losses of doors and even bigger than heat losses of basements and upper floors, which generally have the highest risk.

Brick and stone have been used in architecture for a centuries and are favoured by architects for their unique properties. In recent years, with the development of new technologies, the variety of brick and stone materials has been greatly extended. This superbly illustrated book discusses masonry in two sections addressing brick and stone respectively, and goes further into detailed classification. The projects are elaborately selected and analysed, each presented with photos, drawings and narratives.
