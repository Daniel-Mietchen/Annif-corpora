Marketing Ruka and Kuusamo on the Internet : a study of the ruka.fi website
Levi is a holiday resort in the Finnish Lapland. It has become the largest leisure and ski resort in all of the Nordic countries when measured by the accommodation capacity. At the time of writing this thesis there are 15,000 beds available for the use of tourists in different hotels, apartments and cottages. However, the amount of hotel rooms available in Levi is yet rather small amounting up to less than 10 % of the overall accommodation capacity in the whole area.   The main research question in this study was to evaluate and discuss about the of the three hotels operating in Levi; their different business operations, positioning, development and individual characteristics and distinct features. The three studied hotels were Hotel Hullu Poro, Hotel Levitunturi and Hotel Sirkantähti. The thesis was looking to give an overview of the hotels current situation concentrating on the above-mentioned factors.   A research in the form of an e-mail survey was conducted to support the observation by the author as a questionnaire was sent to the sales managers of the hotels looking to answer the main research question. According to them the competitive and cooperative situation between all of the three hotels operating in Levi is on a very healthy basis. Real competition among the hotels occurs only during the off-season. The hotels have constant tight cooperation together and they all take actively part in developing Levi as a tourist destination. However, despite the similarity in perceptions by the hotels differences could also be detected and conclusions could be drawn.
