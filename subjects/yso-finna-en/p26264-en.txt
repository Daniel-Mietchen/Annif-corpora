swastika
The Hakenkreuz, or broken cross, became the vivid icon under which Adolph Hitler united his destitute and pride-starved nation. As Der FuÌˆhrer, supreme leader of the Reich, Hitler rejoiced that the swastika was openly displayed in churches throughout Germany. Confused at first by their responsibilities, then deceived by their pride, many church leaders capitulated to the wave of nationalism that swept the cross of Jesus Christ from its rightful place. Others did not -- and paid the ultimate price for upholding the truth. Erwin W.
