The effect of planning time on written L2 performance : accuracy and syntactic complexity
In this article, the quality of Russian import statistics is assessed by comparing them to corresponding export data from partner countries. While discrepancies between Russian import data and partner country export data have visibly diminished over the past decade, the quality of Russian import statistics is still slightly poorer than those produced by its peers. Discrepancies are more pronounced at the disaggregate level, and both magnitude and sign vary by partner country and product group. Some discrepancies can be explained by misclassification, while some apparently reflect deliberate misreporting.   Keywords: International trade statistics, mirror statistics, Russia .

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality for disorders of the musculoskeletal system. The distinguishing advantages of MRI are absence of ionizing radiation, excellent tissue contrast and the ability to use any arbitrary imaging plane. MRI can also be used as a guidance method for various percutaneous procedures.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of MRI guidance for musculoskeletal biopsies and therapeutic bone drillings. A 0.23 tesla open configuration MRI scanner with an interventional optical guidance system was used.172 percutaneous biopsies performed using MRI guidance were reviewed to define the safety and accuracy of the guidance method. The value of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) as a supplementary diagnostic procedure for core biopsy was also evaluated. The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy was 0.95, sensitivity 0.91, and speciﬁcity 0.98. The diagnostic accuracy of histological biopsy alone was 0.93, sensitivity 0.89, and speciﬁcity 0.98, and accuracy for FNAB alone was 0.85, sensitivity 0.80, and speciﬁcity 0.90. MRI guidance was deemed feasible and accurate and fine needle biopsy a useful supplement.The feasibility and safety of MRI-guided retrograde drilling of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee were evaluated by analysing ten procedures. All the lesions were successfully located and reached without complications. All patients experienced pain alleviation and follow-up MRI showed ossification in all.The feasibility and safety of MRI-guided retrograde drilling of osteochondritis dissecans of the talus were assessed by evaluating four procedures. Technical success was achieved in all cases and no complications were reported. All patients experienced some clinical benefit, although the changes in the pathological imaging findings were subtle.The feasibility and safety of MRI-guide d core decompression for avascular necrosis of the femoral head were assessed by analysing twelve such procedures. The patients quantified their symptoms before and after the procedure. All procedures were successful without complications. All patients with low-stage disease benefited from the procedure. MRI guidance seems accurate, safe and technically feasible for the therapeutic bone drillings studied.
