The beer bible
"A book with more than 75 recipes from an internationally acclaimed chef/brewer duo dedicated to elevating and pairing beer with high-end dining. The debut book by Danish gypsy brewer Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs of the bar T rst, and Canadian chef Daniel Burns of the Michelin-starred restaurant Luksus -- both in a shared space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn where they elevate beer to the level of wine in fine dining. With a dialogue running throughout the book, Food & Beer examines the vision and philosophy of this duo at the forefront of a new gastronomic movement. With a stunning, bold aesthetic, the design will highlight the dual visions of the authors and the spaces -- T rst, which is more rustic and relaxed, and Luksus, which is more sleek and refined. Foreword by internationally renowned chef Ren e Redzepi, co-owner of Noma in Copenhagen." --
