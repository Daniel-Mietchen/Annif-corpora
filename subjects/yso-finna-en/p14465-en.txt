Information is power in supply chain operations, negotiations, continuous improvement programs, process improvement, and indeed in all aspects of managing an operation. Accurate and timely information can result in better decisions that translate into the improvement of bottomline results. The development and effective use of cost modeling as a method to understand the cost of products, services, and processes can help drive improvements in the quality and timeliness of decision making. In the supply chain community, an understanding of the actual cost structures of processes, products and services, whether with new or nonpartner suppliers, can facilitate fact-based discussions that are more likely to result in agreements that are competitively priced and with fair margins. Further, accurate cost models that are cooperatively developed between supply chain partners can form the basis for joint efforts to reduce non-value-added costs and provide additional focus toward operational improvement.

International trade in fishery products has increased, together with the absolute and relative importance of aquaculture, as a source of fish production. Shrimp and salmon are two examples of species grown in developing countries that are traded internationally. How successful a country is in competing against other producers depends in part on transport and on satisfying food standards, but also on its costs of production. Comparative advantage is a means of comparing relative costs and indicating the species and markets where there is the greatest likelihood of success. There are problems with estimating comparative advantage: the method can be static rather than dynamic and may not indicate long-run opportunities. However, it is a useful tool for planners who devise aquaculture strategies and for individual fish farmers. Two methods exist for estimating comparative advantage -- both have been applied to aquaculture. The domestic resource cost (DRC) method relies on production cost data to compare efficiency. Distortions may require the estimation of shadow prices to reflect true social opportunity costs but, when adjusted, the country that has the lowest DRC has a comparative advantage. The DRC method is dynamic, providing useful information to decision-makers; however, cost data may be difficult to obtain and shadow pricing is problematic. The second method is revealed comparative advantage (RCA) whereby comparative advantage is inferred from an ex post assessment of actual trade and specialization. From trade statistics, estimates are obtained to examine whether a country exports a species to a particular country more than to the rest of the world; if so, it is judged to have a comparative advantage in that particular market. The RCA method is more descriptive and has less predictive potential than the DRC approach but it has the advantage of data availability. This paper illustrates the concept of comparative advantage and some of its policy implications by presenting two case studies: the first one focuses on shrimp exporting countries while the second one is based on freshwater aquaculture production of carp, catfish and tilapia. The RCA method is used in both cases.

Finding the fit between engineering design and cost information
A trial was conducted on-station with farmer participation at Fumesua (Forest zone), Wenchi (Forest-Savannah transition zone) and Bodwease (Coastal Savannah zone) from 2000 to 2003 and on-farm during 2002-2003. Two factors, staking and species, with two levels each were assessed using the Augmented RCB design. The objective of this study was to identify genotypes capable of producing high and stable yields under staking and non-staking condition. No significant differences (P>0.05) were observed in disease severity, frequency of hand weeding and yield of D. alata genotypes. Among the D. rotundata genotypes, leaf spot severity was more severe on non-staked genotypes except in TDr95/19177 where no significant differences were observed between the staked and non-staked genotypes. Tuber yield of the genotypes were significantly increased by staking. In Punjo the increase in yield of staked over non-staked plants ranged between 51.3 and 56.5%. Similarly, the yield of non-staked Dorban was increased by staking by 48.1-55.9% and Tela by 44.9-47.6%. Non-staked TDr95/19177 was technically and economically the more efficient system for production followed both staked and non-staked Punjo, Dente and Tela. Generally, cost of yam production was greater in the coastal savannah than the forest and the forest-savannah transition, due to the largest cost of labour and staking.

Developing knowledge workers in the printing and publishing industries : education, training and knowledge management in the publishing supply chain from the creator to the consumer
The development of large-scale agricultural mechanization required to sustain food production, combined with limited conventional fuel resources, spurs on to better assess the time and energy investments required for commodities production. The proposed analysis is based on the description of field working dynamics collected on an experimental tractor during a plowing operation. The energy needs can there be characterized as having a dual alternating profile, depending on the tractor working phase within the field. As a result, two field oriented performance indicators consisting in time efficiency [h.ha-1] and area specific consumption [l.ha-1] are defined out of the profile characteristics. A model converting the draft of an implement into an engine running point is then developed to compute these indicators. The model is fitted on data collected over conventional bench tests, and is validated by an application to a plowing operation. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis on the operational parameters is conducted.

Studies on dynamic optimization of production management for papermaking with uncertainties in cost and demand
The aim of this paper is to present the method and tool for optimisation of beef-fattening diets. Changes in policy environment and changes in costs of feed pose challenges for farm efficiency. We construct a spreadsheet from two modules based on mathematical deterministic programming techniques. In order to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of costs that may be incurred, the first module utilizes a linear program for least-cost ration formulation. The resulting value is then targeted as a cost goal in the second module. This is supported by weighted goal programming with a penalty function system. The approach presented here is an example of how a combination of mathematical programming techniques might be applied to prepare a user-friendly tool for "optimal" ration formulations. We report results that confirm this approach as useful, since one is able to formulate a least-cost ration without risking a decrease in the ration's nutritive value or affecting the balance between nutrients.
