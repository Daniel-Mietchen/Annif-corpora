This Discussion Paper critically examines local governance in the Niger Delta and its relevance to the search for inclusive and sustainable conflict-resolution in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It critiques the existing local government system and explores the possibility of reconceptualising local governance along more inclusive, accountable and participatory lines that would institutionalise democracy, development and peace at the grassroots or community level in the troubled oil-rich region. Its originality lies in its departure from top-down perspectives, and its refocusing of attention on the oft-neglected local sites of conflict and under development. The paper will appeal to scholars, policy actors and development planners with a particular interest in developments at the African grassroots level.

"Zen Skin, Zen Marrow examines the conflict between two competing perspectives on Zen Buddhism. Two warring camps have collided on several major issues. The traditionalists propagate a self-definition based on notions of ineffability, nonduality, and social harmony. Recent reformers, however, undertake historical and cultural criticism that challenges the traditional claims of the meaning of Zen. In Zen Skin, Zen Marrow, Steven Heine argues that a neutral approach is possible and lays the groundwork for a constructive compromise based on balanced, nonevaluative methodology. This approach allows for a juxtaposition of competing views that can contribute to and benefit one another, avoiding the stagnant polarization that characterizes most encounters involving traditionalists and critics."--BOOK JACKET.
