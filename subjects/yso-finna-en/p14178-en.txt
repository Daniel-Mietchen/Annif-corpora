Weapons of mass defamation : aspects of the 2006 'Cartoon Crisis'
Islam and the West
The so called 'cartoon crisis' that arose in the wake of the publication of twelve satirical drawings of the Prophet Muhammad has been discussed in numerous ways. So far, however, the debate has not included a deeper analysis of why the desecration of Islam's prophet ignited such a response. Contrary to the claims of Islamic dogmaticism, the attributions regarding Muhammad's properties as a human being in Islamic culture in certain ways supersedes the cult for Allah. Muhammad is perceived as the perfect human being, and everything good about humanity consequently has Muhammad at its root. The disfavouring of Muhammad therefore is the disfavouring of any Muslim and of humanity as such. The article argues that the cartoons were interpreted more than anything else as a mockery of human dignity, and that the response was in defense of that rather than of Islamic dogmaticism.

This volume collects papers from the 24th Congress of the Union Européenne des Arabisants et Islamisants (UEAI) in 2008 at the University of Leipzig. Original research and new approaches illustrate its theme of "Sources and Approaches across Disciplines in Near Eastern Studies". The studies span Muslim culture, civilizations, and intellectual thought in the medieval and modern periods. The contributions demonstrate the benefits of following methodological and interdisciplinary approaches that draw upon literary criticism, sociology and anthropology in the field of Qur'anic studies, religion, philosophy and mysticism; state and society; literature and rhetoric; philology and linguistics; mathematics and astronomy; art and epigraphy; and Islamic sciences and economic history. The volume also highlights the commonalities and overlaps that exist between these different branches and fosters cooperative study across a wide cultural, historical, and sociological milieu. Rather than following an isolated approach to their areas of study, academics in different fields of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies benefited from one another's methodologies, and collectively built a wide body of knowledge.
