The Viking Age was a world very different to our own: a world of violence and magic, swords and slaves. However, there was of course a much more ordinary, everyday side to life. People made things and traded them; they tended crops and livestock; they cooked and looked after their homes; they drank, gambled and went to market. Much has been written about key historical events in the Viking period, but this book takes a closer look at the day-to-day activities of ordinary people.

"Basics of Dental Technology is a major new resource for undergraduate dental students and trainee dental technicians. Employing a task-based approach, the book offers step-by-step guidance to the current techniques and materials used in dental technology. As well as providing thorough instruction as to core competencies in impression handling, model production, tray construction, articulators and facebows, the book introduces the reader to the basics of more specific and/or specialist areas of practice, such as complete and partial denture prosthetics, fixed prosthodontics, orthodontic work, maxillo-facial technology, occlusion and implants. The book also provides an excellent ready reference to instruments, equipment and key terms as well as advice on establishing effective communication within the dental team and study tips"--Provided by publisher.

The purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of the dental equipment market in China and define potential business opportunities in the Guangdong province especially for Finnish investors. The research question was: how to define the potential business opportunity for investors of Finnish dental equipment in the Guangdong province. The objective of this study was to research who the potential customers for Finnish dental equipment are and what the potential customers' requirements and preferences are in Guangdong province. The underlying aim of the study was to provide useful information on the dental equipment market in the Guangdong province to Finnish investors, so that they could consider which segment should be targeted and whether or not to enter the specific market in the future. The conceptual framework for this study was based on the theories of the market environment, market segmentation and marketing mix by authors such as Kotler, Daniels and Jobber. Initially, the study was focused on exploring the current Chinese dental market by investigating the market environment and competition within the industry. Afterwards, business opportunities in the Guangdong province were defined by market segmentation and the marketing mix; moreover customers' requirements and preferences were studied. The deductive approach was used to carry out primary research. Quantitative research was conducted in this study to analyze the question of how to define business opportunity in Guangdong province by using a questionnaire. In addition, secondary research was used to observe the development of the current Chinese dental market. The secondary research revealed that oral diseases are still high in China, and with the improvement of people's living standard, the demand for oral treatment and service is becoming higher and higher. However, the competition in the Chinese dental market has become tougher in the past few years, since many foreign dental companies have entered the market. As a result, the findings of the primary research revealed that although the interest in the Finnish dental equipment is not exactly high in the Guangdong province, there are certain hospitals that showed an interest in any foreign dental equipment. In order to help Finnish investors to understand the dental market in the Guangdong province in detail, the segmentation of hospitals was presented at the end of the thesis. This provides suggestions on potential customers to target in the future.
