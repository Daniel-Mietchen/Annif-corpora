From roulette tables to racetracks, provides a look at how scientists and mathematicians throughout the years have tried to figure out how to beat the house while gambling. The Perfect Bet looks beyond probability and statistics to examine how wagers have inspired a plethora of new disciplines - spanning chaos theory, behavioural psychology, machine learning and game theory - which are not just revolutionising gambling, but changing our fundamental notions about chance, randomness and luck.

"Tobacco, alcohol and gambling corporations have been highly effective in stalling, diverting and blocking public health measures. This book provides an original and engaging expose; of the ethical issues faced by people and organizations when they accept industry money in ways that facilitate corporate influence with the public and with policy makers. It starts with a detailed examination of the risks of accepting such profits and what might be done to reduce them, then moves on to introduce the concept of a continuum of 'moral jeopardy' which shifts the emphasis from accept/not accept binaries to a focus on the extent to which people are willing to accept funding. This shift encourages people to think and speak more about the risks and to develop clearer positions for themselves. The content will be helpful to those working in government agencies, addiction services, community organizations or anyone interested in reducing the harms of addictive consumption"--Provided by publisher.

No longer quarantined in Las Vegas, gambling has become as local as our neighborhood cineplex. If there's not a casino around the corner, there's one on your laptop computer. You can bet on the turn of the card, a roll of the dice--but also the NFL, the NCAA, and which Olson twin marries first. It's no wonder that we spend more money gambling than we do on movies, music, sports, video games, and theme parks combined! Here, acclaimed sportswriter Hoffer takes us on a headlong tour, alternately horrifying and hilarious, across our landscape of luck, discovering just how determined we are to gamble. He also discovers that the very institutions that used to regulate this workout are now its biggest cheerleaders: yesterday's numbers racket is today's state lottery; yesterday's mob casino is now part of a Fortune 500 company. And he concludes that people are, mostly, having a good time.--From publisher description.
