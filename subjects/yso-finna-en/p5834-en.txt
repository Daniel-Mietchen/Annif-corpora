Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
One of the major advancements in NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules has been the development of methods for isotope labeling. At the same time there has been a rapid progress in the number of NMR experiments that utilize such isotope labeled samples. Thus a combination of isotopic labeling and multidimensional, multinuclear experiments has significantly expanded the range of problems in structural biology amenable to NMR. This book is intended to serve as a compendium of isotope labeling for the biomolecular NMR community providing comprehensive coverage of the existing methods and latest developments along with protocols and practical hints on the various experimental aspects. Researchers in academia or industry will find it useful to have a single book covering a wide range of topics including the emerging areas of large/membrane proteins, RNA, metabolonomics and solid state NMR.

High field NMR studies of solids and surfaces
This introductory text presents the basic aspects and most important features of various types of resonances and anti-resonances in dynamical systems. In particular, for each resonance, it covers the theoretical concepts, illustrates them with case studies, and reviews the available information on mechanisms, characterization, numerical simulations, experimental realizations, possible quantum analogues, applications and significant advances made over the years. Resonances are one of the most fundamental phenomena exhibited by nonlinear systems and refer to specific realizations of maximum response of a system due to the ability of that system to store and transfer energy received from an external forcing source.

"The second edition of this book comes with a number of new figures, passages, and problems. Increasing the number of figures from 290 to 448 has necessarily added considerable length, weight, and, expense. It is my hope that the book has not lost any of its readability and accessibility. I firmly believe that most of the concepts needed to learn organic structure determination using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy do not require an extensive mathematical background. It is my hope that the manner in which the material contained in this book is presented both reflects and validates this belief"--
