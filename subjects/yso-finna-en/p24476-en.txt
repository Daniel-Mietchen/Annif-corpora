New York : open to the public
For centuries, China's Forbidden City has captured the world's imagination. Yet the elegant, intimate Qianlong Garden - itself within a 'mini-Forbidden City' inside the Forbidden City - has remained sequestered from public view. This title gives an analysis of the garden, which is one of the most refined and elegant of imperial Chinese gardens.

Näkymätön kaupunki : toteutumattomia suunnitelmia 1900-luvun Turusta = The invisible city : unrealized plans from the 20th century Turku
This captivating book explores the lives of the ordinary people of Pompeii and Herculaneum – the two cities on the Bay of Naples that were buried by the catastrophic volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The plaster-cast bodies of the victims are the most vivid shocking reminders of the horrific event that made Pompeii famous, but who were these men, women and children so cruelly frozen in time? The author and curator of the exhibition brings the inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum back to life from the ashes and ruins of their own homes. Amongst the artefacts are magnificent mosaics, a carbonized wooden cradle and a birth certificate of a little girl, each of which is accompanied by stunning new photography.
