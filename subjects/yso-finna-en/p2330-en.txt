Landscape ecology of a stressed environment
All over the world, efforts are being made to preserve landscapes facing fundamental change as a consequence of widespread agricultural intensification, land abandonment and urbanisation. The 'cultural' and 'resilience' approaches have, until now, largely been viewed as distinct methods for understanding the effects of these dynamics, and the ways in which they might be adapted or managed.

Garden Revolution shows how an ecological approach to planting can lead to beautiful gardens that buck much of conventional gardening's counter-productive, time-consuming practices. Instead of picking the wrong plant and then constantly tilling, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing, Larry Weaner advocates for choosing plants that are adapted to the soil and climate of a specific site and letting them naturally evolve over time.

Inventory of valuable cultural landscapes, nature protection areas and points of historical and cultural value
While the European Landscape Convention adopted in Florence in 2000 by the European Council offers a public-action framework through a normative definition, the marine and submarine dimensions of landscapes are attracting growing interest from researchers worldwide. At a time when marine-conservation objectives are strongly endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the French Marine Protected Areas Agency, a public institution under the governance of the French Ministry of the Environment, has gathered prominent experts to draft the very first interdisciplinary overview of underwater seascapes, so as to initiate and lend direction to a wider reflection on this emerging research topic.
