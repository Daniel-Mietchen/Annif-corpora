Abstract: It is important to bring medical help to those living in West Africa. A good way to do this is by telemedicine. Telemedicine, although it uses power, can be achieved easily with solar panels, and the best solar panels are monocrystalline and cadmium telluride. Using graphical scenarios, statistical derivations, theoretical ideologies acquired from literature reviews, usability ideas and two personal case scenarios, the objective of this project was achieved. Criteria like cost, temperature coefficient, and sustainability can be used as weighing factors in determining the suitability of a solar panel. This study recommends interfacing a telemedicine took-kit with a hand-held tablet PC, and supporting the combination with a power module for both solar energy and battery to improve ergonomics, to decrease the number of power outages and to solve wire management problems. This study suggests collaborations between government and technology-led societies provide investment leverage for the development of sustainable telemedicine platforms for West Africa, while more research in efficient power systems will be considered an added advantage to this process. Finally, health workers, energy engineers, research students, investors and especially those who are passionate about West Africa ́s technological processes will find this study very resourceful.
