From magazine pages to gallery walls, from advertisements to photojournalism, Color Rush charts the history of color photography in the United States from the moment it became available as a mass medium to the moment when it no longer seemed an unusual choice for artists. The book begins with the 1907 unveiling of autochrome, the first commercially available color process, and continues up through the 1981 landmark survey show and book The New Color Photography, which hailed the widespread acceptance of color photography in contemporary art. Color Rush brings together Ansel Adams, William Eggleston, Eliot Porter, Cindy Sherman, Edward Steichen, Stephen Shore, and many more. -- Publisher.
