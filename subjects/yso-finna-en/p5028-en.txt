"In Urban Sprawl and Public Health, three of the nation's leading public health and urban planning experts take a comprehensive look at the interface of urban planning, architecture, transportation, community design, and public health. They summarize the evidence linking adverse health outcomes with sprawling development, and outline the complex challenges of developing policy that promotes and protects public health. This book is essential reading for anyone concerned with issues of public health, urban planning, transportation, architecture, or the environment."--BOOK JACKET.

The aim of this work was to report the results of a study which evaluated the sampling efficiency of an air sampling device, the Split2 Multifunctional Real-Time Dust Monitor. Further aim was to compare the sampling efficiency of the Split2 Dust Monitor with that of a reference device, the Dust Trak Aerosol Monitor.  The data used in this study was obtained from a series of experimental samplings carried out by Yosabeth Kebede and Kalle Kuulasmaa. Two air sampling devices were used to measure the mass concentration of particulate matter at three different sampling sites. The sampling sites were chosen based on the level of particulate matter concentration. Data analysis was then carried out by utilizing Microsoft Excel 2007. The study shows that mass concentration levels read by the Split2 Dust Monitor, operating actively, are linear with that of the Dust Trak Aerosol Monitor. When operated passively, the Split2 almost always read higher than that of the Dust Trak. This is explained by the insufficient introduction of particles into the Split2 inlet while it is operating passively. The Dust Trak on the other hand is equipped with an air sampling pump internally. Abrupt hikes of concentration levels read by the Split2 are most likely attributed to dust loading effects.

The object of this thesis was to examine the design principles of ship air conditioning systems in accommodation spaces regarding the standardized dimensioning, and to create a design tool that suits for this purpose with Microsoft Excel 2010. In order to give the reader a general overview of the subject, the beginning of this thesis concentrates on introducing general air conditioning systems onboard and various components related to them. After this, the basis of calculation for ship air conditioning regarding heat loads and air quantities is presented. The dimensioning of air conditioning systems is based on the international standard ISO 7547:2002, which is generally used in ship building projects. The created design tool functions according to the standard`s specifications and formulas. As the outcome of this thesis, a complete design tool is introduced. It enables a faster and more consistent way of performing heat load and air quantity calculations, and reporting to clients. The thesis was made as an assignment of Foreship Ltd.

Unique problem-and-solution approach for quickly mastering a broad range of calculations This book's problem-and-solution approach enables readers to quickly grasp the fundamentals of air pollution control equipment and essential applications. Moreover, the author sets forth solid principles for the design and selection of air pollution control equipment as well as for its efficient operation and maintenance. Readers gain a deep understanding of both the equipment itself and the many factors affecting performance.  Following two introductory chapters, the book dedicates four chapters to examining control equipment for gaseous pollutants, including adsorption, absorption, and incineration equipment. The remaining six chapters deal with equipment for managing airborne particulate pollutants, including gravity settlers, cyclones, electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers, and baghouses. The appendix contains discussions of hybrid systems, the SI system (including conversion constants), and a cost-equipment model.  Each chapter offers a short introduction to the control device discussed. Next, progressively more difficult problems with accompanying solutions enable readers to build their knowledge as they advance through the chapter. Problems reflect the most recent developments in pollution control and include a variety of performance equations and operation and maintenance calculations. Each problem includes a statement of the problem, the data used to solve the problem, and a detailed solution. Readers may further hone their skills by visiting the text's Web site for additional problems and solutions.  This publication serves both as a textbook for engineering students and as a reference for engineers and technicians who need to ensure that air pollution control equipment operates efficiently and enables their facility to meet all air pollution control standards and regulations.
