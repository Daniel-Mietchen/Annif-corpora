"The international criminal courts and tribunals which deal with perpetrators of atrocities are an established part of the effort to bring an end to impunity for international crimes. This leading textbook gives an authoritative account of international criminal law, and focuses on what the student needs to know - the crimes that are dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as the procedures that govern the investigation and prosecution of those crimes. The reader is guided through controversies with an accessible, yet sophisticated, approach. The four authors have rich experience as lawyers in this field, as teachers of the subject, and as negotiators at the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The book covers new developments in the case law and the practice and is essential reading for students and teachers of international criminal law and international relations. It is supplemented by a package of online resources (www.cambridge.org/law/cryer), which offers convenient access to primary sources, excerpts for supplementary reading, problems and questions for reflection and discussion, and materials for exercises and simulations. Robert Cryer is Professor of International and Criminal Law at the University of Birmingham. Hn Friman is is an Associate Judge of Appeals in Sweden and Deputy Director of the Division of Criminal Law at the Swedish Ministry of Justice. He is Visiting Professor at University College London. Darryl Robinson is a professor at Queen's University, Faculty of Law, Kingston, Canada. Elizabeth Wilmshurst is a senior fellow in international law at Chatham House and Visiting Professor at University College London"--Provided by publisher.
