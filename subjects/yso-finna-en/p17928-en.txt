Final report. 1/2015, User experience and usability in complex systems - UXUS
We make choices every day and the choices are determined by our experiences, preferences and expectations. Brand is the factor that adds value to a product or service in people's minds. We support different brands and accept their existence by making choices. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a better understanding and benefits of branding. In order to reach this purpose, research questions focusing on the example of ASSA ABLOY brand and how the company achieves brand attractiveness were stated. Based on these research questions, a review of the relevant literature was conducted, resulting in a conceptual framework that was used to guide the study's data collection. A qualitative, desk research approach was used using relevant literature and interviews with managers working for ASSA ABLOY. Case study was the best-suited approach since this research paper focused on analyzing, how company achieves its brand attractiveness in a deeper methodical way. The study shows that ASSA ABLOY, as the master brand, is increasing its visibility for total security solutions as the world'ÃÅs largest provider of security solutions. It also shows that developing the visual elements of a brand makes it more attractive.
