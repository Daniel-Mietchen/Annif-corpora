From education to work : cross-national perspectives
This text aims to contribute to current debates on the labour market via an exploration of the significance of sexual and family relations in structuring employment. Through detailed studies of conditions of work in the British tourist industry, it shows how men and women are constituted as different kinds of "workers" in the labour market, not only when segregated in different occupations but also even when they are nominally located in the same jobs. This differentiation is shown to be connected to two key processes: the sexualization of women workers which locates women as sexual, as well as economic, workers; and the operation of family work relations within the sphere of employment, when women work as wives rather than waged labourers in the context of the contemporary labour market. These two processes are then drawn together to show the ways in which labour-market production is gendered.

The aim of this study was to investigate how immigrants have integrated into Finnish life from the standpoints of employment. The empirical research material consisted of 30 interviews with immigrants and four interviews with of? cials and others dealing with immigrant affairs.

One in three reported that they had ? rst received information about vacancies from the Employment Of? ce, and one in ? ve by approaching the employer directly asking for work. One in seven had found out about jobs through friends. .

This study examines the possibilities of TKK's international degree students to find a job in Finland after their studies. The main purpose of this study is to improve TKK's cultural communication in terms of work life preparation for international degree students and to analyze their proficiency in the Finnish labour market. The primary research question of this study is: How can the job hunting process for international TKK students be improved? Secondary questions include: What strengths and weaknesses do international employees bring to an organization? How can they use their strengths to convince employers that they are potentially good employees? How can TKK's Career Services for international students be improved?    Altogether 14 persons contributed to this research process - three persons from TKK's personnel, nine international students and two company personnel. The data gathering process was carried out by using structured interviews and online questionnaires. The interviewees from TKK are all involved in the internationalization process at TKK, the students are international students currently studying at TKK and company personnel belongs to companies who are usually contacted by TKK on employment issues. The theoretical framework was based on a handbook of modern communication theory by Crowley & Mitchell. According to the research the Internet is the best means of communicating to students. It is reliable and can be easily updated. Information should be given to the students in a diplomatic and honest manner. It is important to inform them tactfully about their strengths and weaknesses by encouraging them to utilize the former as a benefit for the employer and to see the latter as a challenge that they can learn from. In this way they gain confidence and awareness, which helps them to convince employers of their uniqueness and cultural knowledge, which are things needed for modern companies operating on an international level.
