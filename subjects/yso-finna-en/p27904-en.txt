The massive growth of the tourism industry during the last 50 years has led the tourists to seek new, unspoilt destinations - often from the developing countries. In the rush to compete about the economic gain opportunities this creates, the well-being of the local population is commonly overlooked. The benefits and costs of tourism are not equally spread. The recent development of alternative tourism has made it possible for the local communities to be also at the receiving end of the tourism profit chain. One example of community-based tourism is Homestay tourism. This kind of tourism has its own characteristics what comes to management and sustainability. This thesis is a case study of the Homestay project of a village in Sabah, Malaysia, called Kiau Nulu. The aim is to define sustainability in small-scale, community-based tourism operations in a rural village setting. In order to do this it was essential to consider the role of tourism in the village, find out who should determine sustainability and for whom it should be developed. The purpose was to provide the villagers with a tool to help them plan their tourism operations. The author used an ethnographic research model, including non-participatory observation, informal interviews and desk research as data collection methods. The data collection was conducted in Kiau village and two other native villages in Sabah during the months from June to August 2003. Villagers and local tourism professionals related to Homestay tourism were discussed with and observed to determine the local point of view to the subject. The results of the research showed, that community tourism operations differ fundamentally from the mainstream tourism in pursue of sustainability, as their product is their own culture and life. Their product cannot be altered, so they have to choose their tourists and concentrate on their own needs and benefit. Also the basic information about the concepts of sustainability and tourisms negative impacts is imperative, before Kiau community can learn to manage tourism sustainably. Tourism must have an objective the villagers set for it. Thus planning and democratic decision making are vital. Becoming dependent on tourism has to be avoided. Sustainability in Kiau has to be determined by the villagers themselves. The scientific 'western' perception of sustainability combined with the locals wants and values can provide an exellent sustainability definition suitable for Kiau's needs and culture. Kiau village has good chances to achieve sustainable development as they still are community-oriented and the values of their ancestors are forming a valuable heritage to rely on. This thesis provides the authors view on sustainability in Kiau, and can therefore present only recommendations based on research.

"Place Peripheral examines community and regional development in rural, island, and remote locales from a place-based approach. This is a timely edited collection, addressing themes that are receiving considerable attention in Canada and internationally as local communities, scholars, researchers and public policy analysts strive to better understand and apply place-based strategies in rural and remote regions. The volume and its contributors examine place-based economic development strategies, recognizing the broader and deeper significance, meanings, and attachments often associated with place and also interrogating such relationships as may exist between sense of place, cultural and social development, and environmental stewardship."--

"A hopeful collection of essays about villages in Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and across the world. The "village" is an idea, a construct, and a way of organising society. Villages constitute the basic unit of analyses in the arts, humanities and the social sciences. For decades, village level studies have been conducted across a wide range of academic disciplines such as archaeology, real-estate management, architecture, computer science, medicine, pharmacy and pharmacology. Through the collection of essays presented, the contributors hope to generate interest in studying villages, to understand the meanings that attach themselves to the concept of the village, and to gain greater theoretical insights into multidisciplinary knowledge and analyses in today's highly developed global society"--

Rural people and communities continue to play important social, economic and environmental roles at a time in which societies are rapidly urbanizing, and the identities of local places are increasingly subsumed by flows of people, information and economic activity across global spaces. However, while the organization of rural life has been fundamentally transformed by institutional and social changes that have occurred since the mid-twentieth century, rural people and communities have proved resilient in the face of these transformations. This book examines the causes and consequences of major social and economic changes affecting rural communities and populations during the first decades of the twenty-first century, and explores policies developed to ameliorate problems or enhance opportunities. Primarily focused on the U.S. context, while also providing international comparative discussion, the book is organized into five sections each of which explores both socio-demographic and political economic aspects of rural transformation. It features an accessible and up-to-date blend of theory and empirical analysis, with each chapter's discussion grounded in real-life situations through the use of empirical case-study materials. Rural People and Communities in the 21st Century is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in rural sociology, community sociology, rural and/or population geography, community development, and population studies--From publisher description.
