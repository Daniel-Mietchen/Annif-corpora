For people who have been diagnosed with a heart condition it is only natural that they are concerned about the future and seek reassurance and help after the initial treatment phase. The authors of The Healthy Heart Book have combined their backgrounds and extensive experience in physiotherapy and nutrition to provide this comprehensive guide to achieving a full recovery. The book covers the current recovery programme information given to patients and builds upon it to provide a thorough understanding of what to do and the reasons for doing it. Common medical terminology is broken down to help guide recovering patients through their recovery while exercises are presented in a straightforward, easy to follow format. It is a patients' guide to achieving a full recovery after a heart attack.

"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases affect many people in Finland. One way to support this patient group is patient education. Since the time spent in the inpatient settings is limited, treatment and education of cardiovascular patients is currently focused mainly on the outpatient settings. This creates pressure for the nurses due to the strict time-frame and high turnover of patients. The purpose of this final project was to find evidence-based knowledge on the patient education of a cardiac patient and to implement a nursing journal club. The research questions were when and how the education for heart patients should be conducted. This final project was done in co-operation with the cardiac outpatient clinic in the University Hospital of Helsinki where the collected knowledge was presented in four journal club sessions. Data collection was done following the basics of literature review and by conducting multiple database searches. A more in-depth analysis was conducted once five most relevant articles were found. These five articles were presented to the nursing staff of cardiac outpatient clinic in Meilahti during May 2011. The issues presented in the nursing journal clubs were focused on the learning needs of cardiac patients, different kinds of patient education methods and the psychological path-way of a patient suffering from a cardiovascular illness. The focus was on going through the results of each article and discussing them together with the nurses. Based on the discussion, it became clear that most crucial points that rose from the articles chosen were taking patient's individual needs into consideration and the importance of consistent planning and documenting care.

Cooking for a healthy heart
Despite needing a heart transplant and against the advice of her doctor, Mary Catherine moves to Uganda to work at a new orphanage. Whatever time she has left, Mary Catherine wants to spend it helping children -- especially since there will be no children of her own. The only problem is Major League Baseball player Marcus Dillinger, the man she never meant to fall in love with. Neither Marcus nor Mary Catherine's other friends -- Tyler Ames and Sami Dawson -- know just how serious her heart condition is. Still, Marcus is sure in the depths of his soul that something isn't right. Ultimately his correspondence with Mary Catherine leads him on a desperate life-or-death mission to rescue her and get her to a United States hospital before time runs out. Meanwhile, Sami and Tyler struggle with issues of their own. In a season when Tyler plans to ask Sami to marry him, the very core of their relationship is in jeopardy
