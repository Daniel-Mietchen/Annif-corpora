The latest techniques for propagating crops with terminal, stem, and leaf/stem cuttings are the focus of this horticulture handbook. All the bases are covered - propagation basics, stock plant management, media, temperature, light, nutrition, plant growth regulators, insect and disease management, equipment, and postharvest handling. From these general subjects, the editors focus in on specifics for scores of specialty bedding plants, perennials, specialty cut flowers, and foliage plants. Then they zoom in even closer, covering more than 60 important floriculture crops in detail so propagators and growers can provide high-quality cuttings and young plants to the market.

The effect of 24 h pulse chemical treatments on the vase life and quality of cut gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii cv. Pags) flowers was studied in a completed randomized experiment. Cut flowers were kept in vases containing solutions of 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate (8-HQS), aluminium sulfate, citric acid, calcium chloride, silver nitrate and distilled water (control). Thirty mg l⁻¹ of sucrose was used for all treatments. Vase life was significantly (P<0.05) extended from 12.0 days (control) to 24.5 days by using combination of aluminium sulfate at 300 ppm and sucrose. Fresh weight (FW) and relative water content (RWC) data indicated that chemical treatments acted primarily by improving water uptake and consequently extending vase life, which suggests that the vase life, scape bending and wilting are all related to the water status of flower. The curvature of the stem in the end of vase life was associated with the folding and wilting of the stem in the vase.
