The thesis was commissioned by Wärtsilä Finland Ltd. Engines R&D section. The purpose was to study the cost estimate of new possible starting air system of a Wärtsilä 46DF engine that is being developed and to compare the existing and possible new starting air system. New starting air system is compatible with Wärtsilä 46F engine. Technical data of the Wärtsilä 46F engines existing starting air system and possible new one is presented. Air consumption and total costs of both systems were compared. The external system is a relevant part of expenses so its effect has been noticed in the thesis. The classification societies' regulations on how systems must be made and what capacities is required were presented. In the thesis the starting air costs per one engine start was calculated and the prices of an external system and a summary of the results were presented. The history of Wärtsilä 46 engine is presented shortly and what kind of engine Wärtsilä 46F is nowadays and where it is in use. Some questions and ideas that rose during making the thesis are suggested. Conclusion was that air consumption decreases with new starting air system 31%, air receiver can be made 12.5% smaller and the cost of starting air decreased 33%

This study analyzes the economic feasibility of gypsum amendment as a means to reduce particulate and dissolved phosphorus loads from arable areas. To this end, an optimization model is developed that includes gypsum amendment as well as matching phosphorus fertilization to crop need and the level of soil phosphorus reserves as phosphorus load mitigation measures, with soil phosphorus reserves measured by soil test phosphorus (STP). The optimal extent of gypsum amendment is then determined simultaneously with optimal fertilization use as a function of field STP level. The results indicate that whether or not gypsum amendment is economically feasible depends on field erosion susceptibility and STP level. When accounting for the costs and benefits to the society on the whole, gypsum treatment suits best to mitigation of phosphorus losses from soils with excessively high phosphorus reserves; once a threshold STP level is reached, gypsum amendment is optimally given up. This threshold level depends on field slope and on society's willingness to pay for water quality.
