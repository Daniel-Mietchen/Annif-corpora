The way in which education is provided for deaf children in both special settings and mainstream schools is changing, as are the demands made on teachers. Written by specialists, this book responds by providing a comprehensive, accessible and up-to-date account of recent research and current issues in educational policy, psychology, linguistics and audiology, as they relate to deaf education. It also provides detailed information about further reading. The book will appeal to student teachers and teachers of the deaf; teachers in mainstream schools; academics working in the area of deafness and disability; audiologists and cochlear implant teams; and parents of deaf children and members of the deaf community.

Now in its second edition, Introduction to Aural Rehabilitation continues to provide all the elements necessary for a comprehensive, practice-oriented course in the habilitation/rehabilitation of children, adults, and the elderly with impaired hearing. This user-friendly text focuses on the most important clinical and practical aspects of providing services to the hearing impaired, while avoiding the technical detail of theoretical texts. This second edition offers more in-depth information on cochlear implantation--including surgical procedures as well as the benefits for children and adults--and is approached from an amplification standpoint across several chapters by new contributing authors
