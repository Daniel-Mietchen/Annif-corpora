This book covers a broad range of materials science that has been brought to bear on providing solutions to the challenges of developing self-healing and protective coatings for a range of metals. The book has a strong emphasis on characterisation techniques, particularly new techniques that are beginning to be used in the coatings area. It features many contributions written by experts from various industrial sectors which examine the needs of the sectors and the state of the art. The development of self-healing and protective coatings has been an expanding field in recent years and applies a lot of new knowledge gained from other fields as well as other areas of materials science to the development of coatings. It has borrowed from fields such as the food and pharmaceutical industries who have used, polymer techniques, sol-gel science and colloidosome technology for a range encapsulation techniques. It has also borrowed from fields like hydrogen storage such as from the development of hierarchical and other materials based on organic templating as "nanocontainers" for the delivery of inhibitors. In materials science, recent developments in high throughput and other characterisation techniques, such as those available from synchrotrons, are being increasing used for novel characterisation—one only needs to look at the application of these techniques in self healing polymers to gauge wealth of new information that has been gained from these techniques. This work is largely driven by the need to replace environmental pollutants and hazardous chemicals that represent risk to humans such as chromate inhibitors which are still used in some applications.

Self-cleaning coatings : structure, fabrication and application
The objective of the thesis was to study the new alternative surface finishes for the printed wiring board. The results of the thesis will be used for the decision on the surface finish of the printes wiring boards for Nokia`s mobile phones. Technologies in soldering and in printed wiring board engineering are developing fast. The size of the high integration components is continously reduced. The solder areas of the components are very narrow. Sometimes too narrow solder areas result in the "black pad" phenomenon. One reason for this phenomenon can be the surface finish of the printed wiring board. This thesis proposes a basis for understanding the surface finishes of the printed wiring board and the surface finish properties that might affect printed wiring board manufacturing. A lot of effort was made to establish these properties. All available information was collected from potential finish suppliers and from other sources. The information was compared with to the manufacturing processes of surface finishes used by Nokia Mobile Phones. The correctness of the information was checked with the help of the literature and Nokia`s own information. The result of the thesis was a set of main criteria for the selection of surface finishes for the manufacturing process of mobile phone applications. This report is divided into two parts. The first part presents general theory of the pre-study of new surface finishes. This part of the work includes a short presentation of the related materials. The material selection criteria are also described at the beginning of the thesis. A lot of attention was focused on reliability, availability and environmtental considerations. The second part describes the test methods and the results of the tests. At the end of the thesis, a conclusion of the test results together with an approximation of the results. This study was begun in May 2001 and was completed within one year.
