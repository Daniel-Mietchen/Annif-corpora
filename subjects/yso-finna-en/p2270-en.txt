This project thesis has been commissioned by our client to focus on the creation of a user-friendly manual, describing the financial support instruments available for SMEs from the Finnish development agencies Finnvera and Tekes. The manual will focus on the SMEs in the field of services, specifically in the Experience industry.     In addition to the manual itself, we have provided an assessment tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the financial instruments  to be used in further research and development. The thesis report contains the key definitions plus an effective introduction to the key development agencies, in order to comprehend conceptually the scope of the project. The role of public agencies in public funding is discussed and the project's framework describes how the thesis question is set and addressed through the production of the manual. Further on, the thesis report reveals the various phases undertaken during the project's development process and the rationale behind these. The conclusions section provides an interesting summary of our key findings during the creation of the manual, which could inspire further research.    The project was completed during the year 2011. It was carried out following a similar path that an SME  would undertake by searching via internet for funding opportunities from Finnvera and Tekes. The information presented in the manual is the result of a massive information search, plus a thorough filtering, reformatting and summarizing visually in order to simplify and accelerate the access to relevant information, and the decision making for the target companies.     The project has been a highly valuable learning process about the role of the development agencies in Finland, the financing instruments available for SMEs, the conversion of massive information into well-structured and highly usable knowledge, and finally, the evaluation of these instruments. Additionally, the process of elaborating the financial manual has revealed several of the key strengths and weaknesses of the agencies' current funding portfolio.

This volume is the latest edition of an international edited book series based on the formation and growth problems of High Technology Small Firms (HTSFs) begun in 1993. This body of work is unique, and maps the evolution of research in this area through almost two decades of academic research and government policy towards a sector that is the key to future prosperity of developed and developing notational economies throughout the world. In this the latest Volume, there is one major and two subsidiary themes that have emerged from the best papers to be presented at the HTSF Conference held at the University of Twente at Enshede in May 2008. Following a contextual introduction by the editors, seven of the chapter are concerned with the key issue of strategy, which is always a key concern for HTSFs as they seek to find the best way to getting their products to the market. Indeed, a further two papers are concerned with the requirements of international marketing, while a final three papers deal with aspects of education for HTSF founders.
