Abstract: Reasons to think about cloud computing. This thesis presents the essential characteristics of cloud computing such as on-demand self-service, broadband access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and the measured service. The study also discusses service delivery models and deployment models, which define how services are delivered to the customer. Cloud computing has security issues just like every computing technology. Because these security problems lie in data transfer and software interfaces, as well as data which has been stored and user access control, they are analyzed in this study. This thesis presents technologies which enable cloud computing such as virtualization and hypervisors that are used to virtualize the servers and which can be used to deploy the services. This thesis was made for a large international IT-company as a part of a customer project. The study presents company products that were used in the project to deliver cost-efficient customer solutions. Cloud computing is a relatively new trend in modern information technology, especially in the constantly evolving Finnish market. This study compares global benefits acquired with cloud computing as well as the effects of this technology to the quality of service and costs. Technologies compared in this study are hypervisors used in server virtualization such as ESXi, KVM, Hyper-V, Xen and PowerVM. Although ESXi hypervisor is the dominant one, it is also more expensive. Open-source- based KVM hypervisor can manage almost the same features but at a significantly lower cost.

Enterprise resource planning is going to the cloud and to stay ahead of the competition, SAP has presented a new solution for companies' finance departments to run their daily business. SAP Simple Finance, the first step of the SAP'S/4HANA roadmap, provides a re-designed data model, a simple user interface and real-time business for companies to help them stay innovative. This thesis studies the new functions that Simple Finance brings to SAP Accounting and investigates, from companies' perspective, how the achieved benefits will affect the way of managing business. In addition to that, the thesis presents SAP's fairly new HANA database as well as discusses the company's strategy with its cloud solutions now and in the near future. Having introduced the three cornerstones of the solution for accounting, cash management and business planning in detail, the thesis discusses why it was necessary to change the user interface and what the solution SAP has come up with is. To provide information on the implementation, the thesis presents the migration steps as well as the roadmap that companies could have when starting the road to SAP HANA. This thesis stands behind SAP's strategy of moving forward but when it comes to Simple Finance, the need for optimized financial solution does not justify the implementation; there has to be a higher level need, and a business case for HANA database.

Cloudonomics : the business value of cloud computing
Cloud computing is not a particular information technology but a concept/channel of communications, sometimes compared to network services such as providing gas or electricity. Cloud computing, giving an opportunity to use IT infrastructure and tools as a service, not a product, has become one of the most influential tendency in a development of modern IT, being a popular method of outsourcing of IT services for companies and individuals. A paper identifies key regulatory problems presently faced by cloud computing. Then a paper delivers a general overview of existing EU legal provisions that can be applied to cloud computing. The application of current regulations to solving problems resulting from cloud computing is rather limited what was confirmed by an opinion on data protection in cloud computing announced in July 2012 by so called Article 29 Working Party. The further part of a paper brings the analysis of the Commission's initiatives concerning cloud computing. Commission's strategy on cloud computing seeks solutions of many issues related to cloud computing in future (currently under preparation) EU regulations such as so-called General Data Protection Regulation and others. The paper concludes that the EU's regulatory policy on cloud computing should be based on 'soft framework' (unbinding soft law and policy measures) rather than binding regulation..

Implications of utilizing cloud computing in data management
"The first chapter gives an overview of cloud computing at a level accessible to a lay person. To motivate the reasons for a paradigm shift in the way we compute and store information, we introduce the concept of network-centric computing and network-centric content. A brief discussion of peer-to-peer systems, a first step in the shift from local to remote data storage and processing follows. The chapter continues with a discussion of technological advances that have made cloud computing possible and of the economical reasons why this new paradigm is attractive for many users and applications. Then we take a closer look at the cloud computing delivery models, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). SaaS gives the users capability to use applications supplied by the service provider but allows no control of the platform or the infrastructure. PaaS gives the capability to deploy consumer-created or acquired applications using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. IaaS allows the user to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The new paradigm raises ethical questions and has significant vulnerabilities each dissected in separate sections. Finally, the chapter presents the major challenges faced by this new paradigm. The chapter concludes with a overview of the literature and with a historic perspective"--

Applies lean manufacturing principles across the cloud service delivery chain to enable application and infrastructure service providers to sustainably achieve the shortest lead time, best quality, and value. This book focuses on lean in the context of cloud computing capacity management of applications and the physical and virtual cloud resources that support them. Lean Computing for the Cloud considers business, architectural and operational aspects of efficiently delivering valuable services to end users via cloud-based applications hosted on shared cloud infrastructure. The work also focuses on overall optimization of the service delivery chain to enable both application service and infrastructure service providers to adopt leaner, demand driven operations to serve end users more efficiently.The book's early chapters analyze how capacity management morphs with cloud computing into interlocked physical infrastructure capacity management, virtual resource capacity management, and application capacity management problems. The middle chapters frame cloud capacity management as a lean thinking problem, lay out strategies for applying lean thinking best practices across the cloud service delivery chain, and apply key lean insights from other industries. Later chapters discuss lean reserve capacity, lean demand management, optimal power management, and quantitative performance metrics of lean capacity management, which can be used to methodically drive continuous improvement of lean cloud computing deployments. The final chapter summarizes the book's insights on lean strategies to minimize waste across the cloud computing service delivery chain. Applies lean thinking across the cloud service delivery chain to recognize and minimize waste.Leverages lessons learned from electric power industry operations to operations of cloud infrastructure. Applies insights from just-in-time inventory management to operation of cloud based applications.

Abstract: Collaborative document management systems. The volume of the electronic documents that the company nowadays has to manage is high. Therefore the systematic document management has a significant role in company's working process. The Internet has enabled that the software can be acquired as a service that operates in a cloud environment. In that case the company has the use of the software and pays only for the use. This study gathered the requirements for the cloud based documentation management system. The purpose of the study was to document both functional and business requirements for the document management system and present some existing cloud based document management systems and their features. The technical documentation of the customer company's current document management system was studied and project participants were interviewed. The initial assumption for the project was to find out, if the cloud based document management system could replace the existing system. As a result of the study the features of the customer company's current documentation management system were listed. These features among other things are storing the documents into the database, configuring the metadata and its structure, handling the documents' versions, versatile search functions, documents encryption, previewing of the documents, commenting, and the mass transfer of the documents. The business requirements for the system are that it is scalable and it supports work sharing between project participants. Also the setup and the usage of the system must be efficient. The costs for the document management system can be estimated with the information of user volumes, disk quota, and the data traffic. When comparing the features of the existing cloud based systems, it was found out that none of the systems did meet all of the requirements. The study works as a basis for the migration to the new cloud based document management system.

Cloud Computing is the IT services delivery model of the near future. The problem is, there there are very few experts that have hands-on understanding of its competitive and organizational impacts. The vast majority of books address the technical details of cloud, but few emphasize its implementation and deployment at the scale of the enterprise. This book provides the models, concepts, and methodologies you need to be successful in your organization's transition to cloud. Through his 23-year IT Transformation background, Philippe Abdoulaye brings a project-oriented approach to cloud transition, with several techniques needed to accelerate adoption of cloud services. The book begins with a definition of the competitive perspective of cloud, provides insights into the cloud-oriented business model, and details through a complete business an agile approach to cloud transition addressing issues as critical IT operating model transformation, SaaS application architecting, and datacenter transformation.

Anite Finland Ltd. is a Finnish based company providing a full range of software and hardware solutions for the mobile network testing. The Nemo product portfolio consists of several products from handheld measurement tools all the way to the powerful data analysing server solutions. The main customers are mobile operators all around the world. Anti-piracy and copy protecting is a serious business, as there are skilful people trying to break the copy protections for illegal income or to gain reputation among the hacker scene. This is where the well-functioning licensing tool comes to question. In this document, licensing is a synonym for copy protection. Regarding the mobile device products, it was decided that the previous licensing method was outdated and was not flexible enough for use of today. There was a serious need for a faster and more efficient way of creating multiple licenses. When having classified data, it is mandatory to have it encrypted. There are several ways of encrypting the data but some algorithms have gained reputation over others. There are two main categories in data encryption; symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In the symmetric encryption, the same key is used for data encryption and for decryption. The most common symmetric encryption algorithm today is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which utilizes Rijndael-algorithm. In the asymmetric encryption, there are two different keys called the private key and the public key. One key is used for encryption and the other key is used for decryption. One of the most well performing asymmetric encryption algorithms is the RSA. Cloud services and cloud computing are making their way to the everyday use in the software development business. All major service providers, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon are providing their own solutions for each cloud computing service layers. The “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) -layer is an effective combination of outsourced computing power with a rather flexible software development environment. The Google App Engine is Google’s version of PaaS, and it is available for free and it offers development tools for Python, Java, PHP and Go.
