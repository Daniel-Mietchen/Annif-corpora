A. O. Väisänen and the importance of the early collecting and study of Fenno-Ugric music
This book is the first ever major effort to document and study hundreds of texts from an African (Ugandan) oral culture for children - folktales, riddles, and rhymes - and at the same time to make them available in the local languages and to focus on their cultural and national value. The author surveys the history of collecting in Uganda and situates the texts in their broader geographical, historical, socio-cultural and educational setting, including the early collecting efforts of heritage-minded Ugandans and European missionaries.
