The objectives of the research were to identify and describe the ongoing processes as they were at the moment, and to provide insight on how to develop these processes. The research covers the first stage of the three stage process development of the Business Information Services. Findings create a base line for the stages 2 and 3; otherwise these stages are not covered by this research. The second stage's objective will be to create clear individual description for the processes and modify existing information and other documents to suit the processes. The objective of the third stage is to conduct the actual process development. The research also provides suggestions on how to develop individual functions inside the process. The theoretical framework was based on literature about process management and development on sales organisation. Most of the theory is based on authors Kai Laamanen,  Jouko Hannus, Olli Lecklin, and Hans-Henry Kvist. These authors have a broad understanding of Finnish organisational process management. The study was executed in the form of two group interviews, or workshops in a basis of an action research method. The researcher and three other sales team members formed the target group, which was used for the data collection. In addition to workshops the data was collected by interviewing the sales director of the Business Information Services to ensure that the collected data was coherent with all interviewees. The analytical approach was qualitative. The results revealed a clear and simple sales process map that describes the ongoing processes inside the sales unit. The results also indicated that there was another significant process that has not been described before. This was the customer relationship management process. It was seen important to include this process to sales unit processes to clearly separate the new sales functions from customer relationship management. In conclusion, a continuous process development model, which is modified from Kvist et al. (1995,64) process development model, should be used. This ensures that the development is done effectively and continuously. Advantages of the effective process management are quicker response to market changes, flexibility, better risk management, and ability to decrease cost by cutting the amount of unnecessary functions. These create a major advantage point against rivals that either are more functional or have poorly designed processes.

This thesis was commissioned by a Finnish banking company, Alexandria Pankkiiriliike Oyj. The aim of the research was to find out the customer satisfaction level among the customers who had not closed a deal in a meeting. The aim was also to find out the level of proficiency of Alexandria's financial advisors and how the service quality and the selling process could be improved. The theoretical framework of the research was formed on the basis of literature related to customer satisfaction and service quality. The central concepts were customer satisfaction, perceived service quality and selling process. The empirical part of the research was conducted as a qualitative research supplemented by some typical features of quantitative research in order to gain all the information needed. The research method was chosen to be phone interviews. The target group of thirty persons was being selected from the customer's who had visited Alexandria's office in Helsinki between 1.11.-31.12-2009 and 15.2.-15.4.2010 but had not closed a deal in the meeting. There were also some other criteria that had to be met, such as the monthly income and the ability to save at least a certain amount of money monthly. Alexandria provided their data base to be used to find the contact and back ground information of the customers. A total of thirty interviews were conducted, but one needed to be disqualified since the respondent refused to answer to one section of the research questionnaire. The research findings in general revealed that the customer satisfaction level at Alexandria Banking Company is relatively high. This is because all the interviewees had not closed the deal and it could have been expected that more unsatisfied customers had been found. It seems that Alexandria's main concern does not lie in its advisors' competence level or in one larger area but in many small things. The main processes of the company seem to be working well, but it would be wise to consider the suggested small details in the selling process to gain even a better customer satisfaction level.

Selling is tougher than ever before. Potential customers are under extreme pressure to do more with less money, less time, and fewer resources, and they're wary of anyone who tries to get them to buy or change anything. Under such extreme conditions, yesterday's sales strategies no longer work. No matter how great your offering, you face the daunting task of making yourself appear credible, relevant, and valuable. Now, internationally recognized sales strategist Jill Konrath shows how to overcome these obstacles to get more appointments, speed up decisions, and win sales with these short-fused, frazzled customers. Drawing on her years of selling experience, as well as the stories of other successful sellers, she offers four SNAP Rules: Keep it Simple: When you make things easy and clear for your customers, they'll change from the status quo; Be iNvaluable: You have to stand out by being the person your customers can't live without; Always Align: To be relevant, make sure you're in synch with your customers' objectives, issues, and needs; Raise Priorities: To maintain momentum, keep the most important decisions at the forefront of their mind. -- From publisher description.

Most people know selling is much more difficult than it was just a few years ago. But do you know what you can do to grow your sales in today's tougher market? Getting Into Your Customer's Head provides the answer. This book will help you anticipate buyers' thoughts and feelings so you can stay in step with them - which is one giant step ahead of your competition. Getting Into Your Customer's Head will help you increase sales by matching new selling techniques to today's tougher buying behavior. Kevin Davis presents eight unique selling roles and a clear plan of action needed for each step of the sale. The student, doctor, architect, coach, therapist, negotiator, teacher, and farmer roles all have specific techniques for moving you and your customer smoothly through the buying process. For example, the student role shows you how change affects your customers and how you can use this knowledge to open closed doors. The doctor diagnoses "little problems" and uncovers "big needs." The architect designs customer-focused solutions that lock out competition. Kevin's advice will sharpen your competitive selling skills. Techniques such as finding the "power broker" (the real decision maker) in a complex sale provide valuable tools for selling smart and winning the sale. Getting Into Your Customer's Head teaches you how you can prevent customers from defecting to the competition with new techniques that build customer loyalty. And the "No Tricks" method of negotiating shows you how to win profitable agreements without cutting price.

The objective of this thesis was to create a sales guide for the internal use of Hewlett Packard. The guide was needed to ensure a smooth cooperation between the sales personnel and the staff at Sales Operations, a part of the organisation that offers services to the sales personnel to help them in their work. The idea for such a guide surfaced from the discussions held within the Special Pricing team.  First a plan was made for the creation of such a guide. After the planning phase it was time to implement the plan. First according to the plan, information was gathered from the company intranet. Next a series of interviews was conducted and data gathered from both the intranet and the interviews was used to create the guide. Along the way a few additional uses for the guide were thought of. These will also be explained in this study. As a result of this project a document called the Sales Guide was created. Originally the doc-ument was planned as a helpful hand book for the sales personnel at HP. The guide that resulted from this project is a comprehensive guide to the workings of the Sales Operations as a whole and it can be used in training new employees and as a helpful insight used in support of process development.  First in the thesis Hewlett Packard is introduced and then project management and the sales management process are briefly explained as they provide a theory basis for the completed sales guide. Next this thesis turns its attention to the creation of this guide. In the end, some recommendations for the future are offered.
