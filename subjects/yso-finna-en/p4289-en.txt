No way down : life and death on K2
Each player leads a team of two mountaineers who are competing with other teams, trying to reach the peak and survive until the end of the 18-day expedition. Players move mountaineers on the board by playing cards. The higher a climber reaches, the more victory points are gained. However K2 is a very dangerous place and mountaineers must be very careful not to exhaust themselves, carefully planning their route and being aware of changes in the weather.

Flakes, jugs and splitters : a rock climber's guide to geology
A mountain might be thousands of feet high, but it can still grow taller or shorter each year. This classic picture book explores how mountains are made—including how Mount Everest grew from a flat plain under an ocean to become 29,028 feet tall! This book features simple activities and fascinating cross-sections of the earth’s moving crust that clearly explain plate tectonics. Both text and artwork were vetted for accuracy by an expert in the field.
