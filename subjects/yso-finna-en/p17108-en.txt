It is challenging to run a project and hand it over into daily processes. This thesis examines Nord Pool Spot AS' (later NPS) issues in current project and operational processes. It has been a common problem in NPS that the project team has had the best knowledge of new systems. This has led to a situation where the daily operation team depends on the project team and/or persons who have worked for the project.    The thesis is based on a research problem to define an optimal project handover model for small or medium size organizations. It intends to describe a model which ensures the end user's sufficient knowledge of the project. In other words, the goal is to define how to ensure thorough knowledge of new systems for the end-users.    The research methodology in this thesis is the case study method. With the help of semi standardized interviews, the plan was to organize the theory to present best practice. The data was collected by interviewing employees, employers, and suppliers. Also, an external project manager's project diary was studied.    The most common issue in project handover in NPS is to define the end user's roles and responsibilities. The reason for this, and similar issues in all these projects (Enex, Sets and Sesam) is the need for the organizational maturity to run projects according to standards. Other issues included the motivation of end users. Among project members, the motiva-tion is good but since the end users are not committed to the new product in the early phase, their motivation is lacking.  The model that this organization is missing is clear responsibilities for each process; clear phases for the project; validating and verifying project results; and commitment of the operational team.
