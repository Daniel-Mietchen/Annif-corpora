Basic and advanced counseling provides a unique emphasis on skill assessment, helping students evaluate and improve their counseling techniques. The authors use a framework of self-assessment tools and guided observations by experienced counselors--the Skilled Counselor Training Model--to encourage students to develop an accurate appraisal of their own skill levels. The text also offers training on how to transfer counseling skills to actual counseling sessions.

This book provides interesting and critical insights into a common university practice, the academic office hour. Office hours are a discursive site for a variety of different issues, ranging from administrative matters to course-related and study-related concerns. The study offers both an ethnographic account of this speech event within the socio-cultural context of a German university as well as a more detailed analysis of the interactional organization of academic consultations. It draws on natural recordings of entire office hour interactions in order to show how participants' actions at different stages of the talk organize and accomplish the consultation. The analytical focus is set on the sequential activities teachers and students engage in as they conduct a consultation. This includes, for instance, how participants open an office hour talk, how they establish an agenda, how they manage advice-giving, and how they close the consultation. As such, this book will be of practical use to students and faculty members as well as scholars from different disciplines who work in the areas of institutional talk and talk-in-interaction.

"The landscape of higher education has dramatically altered in the past 30 years as more students are attending universities and colleges than ever before. In such a competitive market, the quality of the student experience is pivotal to an institution's ability to attract students. However, the increasing costs of delivering HE teamed with a reduction in government funding means that creating a high standard of student experience has never been more challenging. The Student Experience 'Practitioner Model' discussed in this book recognises the need of staff at all levels who are developing and implementing initiatives to improve and enhance the student experience. It provides an organised and detailed structure that can be orchestrated in a cost effective and highly adaptable manner. It guides Practitioners in the identification of what they must deliver, who it is delivered to and when they need to deliver by working through the six key stages of the new student lifecycle: - First Contact and Admissions; - Pre-arrival; - Arrival and Orientation; - Induction to Study; - Reorientation and Reinduction (Returners Induction) - Outduction (preparation for life after undergraduate study). -- Provided by publisher.
