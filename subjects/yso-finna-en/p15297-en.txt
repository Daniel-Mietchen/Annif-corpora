inspection of electrical apparatus
InvoDane Engineering is an engineering consulting company that specializes in providing engineering services for oil, gas and water pipeline industries. This engineering thesis was commissioned by the company and it is a development project for pump unit with water hydraulics. The pump unit is a hydraulic power pack whose main components are a pressure pump and a vacuum pump. The purpose of the pump unit is to actuate a cylinder piston and power the hydraulics onboard the piston. The hydraulic system is used when inserting a water inspection tool into a water pipeline and extracting it from the pipeline. The objectives of the work were to do a feasibility study of an electrically driven system, reduce system weight and improve flow rate capacity at high pressure. The enhancements were to be demonstrated and tested by assembling a prototype pump unit. Improvement suggestions for shipping characteristics and system filtration were also to be presented. The system was tested and test results confirmed that electric motor can run the pump and replace the gas engine in the original system under the circumstances it was tested in. Based merely on the tests performed, it is not yet possible to reduce weight and ease the use of the unit by excluding the vacuum pump from the system. Improved hose and valve arrangement in the test setup proofed itself to be a good base to start developing the functionality of the hydraulics further.  Next step in developing the pump unit would be to test the setup in real insertion and extraction situations with cylinder piston and decide on future enhancements based on the results.
