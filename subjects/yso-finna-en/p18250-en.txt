The black man's burden : Africa and the curse of the nation-state
The formation of the nation-states is as much the result of developments regarding land and people, as of military and political struggle. This book looks at the various aspects and stages of this process in Greece and Turkey. It considers the debates, social forces and world-historical events that have affected national boundaries.

The Synchronization of National Policies shows how it is possible that there is remarkable uniformity in the policies that the nation-states adopt, although there is no world government. Mainstream research attributes such global governance to the influence of leading countries, to functional requirements created by capitalism and technological development, or to international organizations. This book argues that to understand how national policies are synchronized we need to realize that the global population forms a single global tribe of moderns, divided into some 200 clans called nations. While previous research on the world culture of moderns has focused on the diffusion of ideas, this book concentrates on the active role of local actors, who introduce global models and domesticate them to nation-states. In national policymaking, actors justify new policies by international comparisons, by the successes and failures of models adopted in other countries, and by building and appealing to the authority of international organizations. Consequently, national policies are synchronized with each other. Yet, because of the way such domestication of global trends takes place, citizens retain and reproduce the understanding that they follow a sovereign national trajectory.

State, Security, and Subject Formation brings together leading scholars to examine the question of how to secure the conditions for a civil and peaceful life together. State, Security, and Subject Formation addresses the question of how to secure the conditions for a civil and peaceful life together. It brings together leading scholars to examine democracy from two approaches: peaceful coexistence and the secular state as public authority and the necessity of division between communities of faith that allows for a state that defends the values of the community. This book aims to understand the rationality that informs both approaches, interpreting the subjectivities within each. To do so, the interdisciplinary, scholarly essays examine 17th century political thought and how it is caught up in debate about the relationship between faith and the state at a time when religious wars are endemic and profoundly destructive. They also provide an in-depth discussion of contemporary 21st and 20th century approaches to the question of security and the issue of subjective capacity for peaceful coexistence. Through its thematic juxtaposition of state, security, and subjectivity within the framework of civil order and politics, the book fills a gap in the contemporary political literature that will be of interest to anyone studying and researching these issues.

"European integration has in many ways been an important attempt to institute a form of political organization that moves beyond the state. For many of the early proponents of European integration, the nation state had become associated with militarism, jingoism and the many devastating wars on the European continent. Drawing on post-structuralist theoretical advances, this book compares practices of European integration with practices of statecraft and argues that far from transcending the modern state form, the practices of European integration in many ways reproduce it. Borg asserts that the project of European integration is plagued by similar ethico-political dilemmas as the modern state, and is ultimately animated by a similar desire to either expel or interiorize difference. In critically examining the practices of European integration, Borg questions whether they may be said to go beyond modern statecraft and what is at stake in such attempts. "--
