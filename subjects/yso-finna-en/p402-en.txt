Management consulting today and tomorrow : perspectives and advice from 27 leading world experts
Abstract: Management consulting. Management consulting has long roots that reach all the way to the 19th century. First known as efficiency experts, they worked to improve efficiency on the shop floor level. Quite soon after, management consulting started to evolve in to a industry challenging the traditional industries. Today, the main purpose of management consultancies is to study and analyze the structure and functioning of a company as a whole or part of its segments and to find opportunities and strategies to improve the company's efficiency in the management level. The thesis aims to illustrate how management consulting has evolved over the years, how do the client and consultant communicate with each other, how to make consulting engagements as successful as possible and what problems might rise when dealing with management consultancies. The study was carried out by analyzing a number of different literature sources and by assembling the information into a form that would allow the reader to look directly into the client-consultant interaction. All the presented information aims to help the understanding of management consulting and the practical issues revolving around it.
