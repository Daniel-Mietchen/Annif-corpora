The Female Body and the Law provides an original and incisive reexamination of the dynamics of sexual equality. Eisenstein contends that sexual inequality is fostered both by the law and by the insistence that men and women are biologically different. Through a fascinating discussion of a series of issues including affirmative action, AIDS, Baby M, pornography, and abortion, Eisenstein shows how the law operates as a political language that establishes and curtails choices and actions.

Mapping the Women's Movement charts the development, diversification and politics of movements in the United States and key countries in Western and Eastern Europe, as well as Japan, in order to draw out their wider implications. It shows that feminist political action to change institutions, policy-making and the law has been far more successful in delivering gains to women's lives than was presaged by the early movement's emphasis on personal liberation. These gains have been accomplished mainly through public action and the mobilization of alliances with parties of the left or with the support of governments and legislators. But the emergence of a distinctly 'second-class' female workforce, plagued by low pay and bereft of employment protection and benefits, shows up the limits of women's ability to rely on market forces to consolidate their position. Coupled with governmental moves to roll back the boundaries of public responsibility, such developments reveal the extent to which the women's movement needs instead to ally itself with political forces tat value the role of the public realm, and develop a strategy for operating in the current business-oriented policy environment.
