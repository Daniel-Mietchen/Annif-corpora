"Subject Areas/Keywords: classrooms, content areas, curriculum, developmental psychology, early childhood education, early intervention, early literacy, educational psychology, families, family, instructional methods, knowledge acquisition, parents, pedagogy, play, preschool, teaching, texts, vocabulary, young children DESCRIPTION Synthesizing cutting-edge research from multiple disciplines, this book explores how young children acquire knowledge in the "real world" and describes practical applications for early childhood classrooms. The breadth and depth of a child's knowledge base are important predictors of later literacy development and academic achievement. Leading scholars describe the processes by which preschoolers and primary-grade students acquire knowledge through firsthand experiences, play, interactions with parents and teachers, storybooks, and a range of media. Chapters on exemplary instructional strategies vividly show what teachers can do to build children's content knowledge while also promoting core literacy skills"--

In Press Freedom and Pluralism in Europe , researchers from twelve countries examine media systems regarding conditions for independence and pluralism in the current European media system. They discuss a European approach to press freedom and diversity and include case studies of a broad spectrum of media systems including Bulgaria, the Baltics, Poland, Romania, Germany, Austria, Italy and the UK.The volume examines how economic, historic, cultural and social factors have a substantial impact on media independence. With a need for new media policies facing a changing media world, this is an essential resource for media studies and journalism scholars.

The objective of the thesis was to determinate how development discussions should be implemented at HAMK in the Degree Programme in International Business so that they would benefit the student and the organization.   The two issues which are in conflict in the development discussion process at universities of applied sciences are the resources and the benefits of the process. The process has been found useful and recommended in business life but in order to implement it, resources must be set. The challenge of the thesis is on the one hand to prove exactly how useful the development discussion process is and why the resources should be sacrificed.   The theory of the development discussion process is gathered from different sources, but mostly from business life as there is little theory to be found written about development discussions in higher education. The business life theory as well as the questionnaires and interviews conducted for this study do support the practical suggestions created for the Degree Programme in International Business. As an end result the thesis provides HAMK practical improvements and suggestions for implementing development discussions for students.
