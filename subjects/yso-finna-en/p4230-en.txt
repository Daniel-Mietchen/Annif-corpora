Change is now so commonplace that people no longer talk in terms of the "whitewater epoch". Every sector of the economies of the developed world has experienced huge swathes of change in the last decade of the twentieth century alone. Increased global competition, aided and abetted by technological advances, has led many organizations to seek to re-invent themselves in the hope of being able to survive and thrive. In mature sectors in particular, where the pace of consolidation is accelerating, organizations have had little option but to grow through acquisition or be absorbed. Whether the change is labelled "continuous process improvement", "restructuring", "downsizing" or re-engineering", to employees, change usually brings with it added pressures, job insecurity and a consequent loss of commitment to the organization. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success argues that strategic change in the new millennium will be geared increasingly to achieving sustainable high performance, rather than just short-term gains. Most theorists now agree that the real challenge of change lies in gaining employees" willingness to commit to the change effort. Change leaders at every level need to be able to understand the elements at work in any change process, and to use judgement about the style of leadership required to give the change effort the best chance of success. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success provides an overview of change and organizational theory, leading in particular to the author"s definition of the "input" elements of the high performance organisation, based on extensive research into UK and international organisations. It also contains a section looking at the management of change, with case studies illustrating approaches to managing change which are conducive to achieving sustainable high performance. In her companion book, The High Performance Organization- creating dynamic stability, the author explores some of the "how to"s" of building an organizational culture which is supportive of high performance in today"s challenging environment.

The International Handbook of Leadership for Learning brings together chapters by distinguished authors from thirty-one countries in nine different regions of the world. This handbook contains nine sections that provide regional overviews; a consideration of theoretical and contextual aspects; and, system and policy approaches that promote leadership for learning with a focus on educating school leaders for learning and the role of the leader in supporting learning. It also considers the challenge of educating current leaders for this new perspective, and how leaders themselves can develop leadership for learning in others and in their organisations, especially in diverse contexts and situations. The final chapter considers what we now know about leadership for learning and looks at ways this might be further improved in the future. This book provides the reader with an understanding of the rich contextual nature of learning in schools and the role of school leaders and leadership development in promoting this. It concludes that the preposition 'for' between the two readily known and understood terms of 'leadership' and 'learning' changes everything as it foregrounds learning and complexifies, rather than simplifies, what that word may mean. Whereas common terms such as 'instructional leadership' reduce learning to 'outcomes', leadership for learning embraces a much wider, developmental view of learning.
Review of the methods for the development of information security policies at organizations
Compared with the manufacturing of advanced countries, the application of simulation technology in the China is still in its early stages, the specific performance of the application of simulation technology Chinese the polarization is obvious, the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in the application level of simulation technology and large enterprises have a big gap. The enterprise lacks the talent echelon of simulation technology application. The application of simulation technology maturity of most enterprises is still relatively low, the lack of simulation process specification, material database, but simulation technology independent application in various disciplines; from application and product simulation technology design and test department, also can only be simulation technology as a means of verification. The potential of China simulation software market is huge, but also need long-term cultivation. Aonesoft Company should keep their leading position in industry, development rapidly without loss of stability, continue to strive for best partner of ANSYS Asia Pacific area. Therefore Aonesoft Companys future will be thriving. The future of simulation software will be more intelligent and cross platform development. By strengthening the research and development of new simulation software and strengthen industry demand, through the pilot to promote the application of traditional simulation software upgrade. The environment and the industry structure of simulation software in the future will be more complete and solid also vivid.

This publication describes the basis from which the structures, strategies and teaching and learning processes of open and distance learning were created and implemented for the first time at Tribhuvan University in Nepal. JAMK University of Applied Sciences has collaborated with diverse organisations in Nepal for several years. The development collaboration that this publication focuses on concerns the Training of Trainers for the Teacher Qualification Upgrading Programme in Nepal (ToT Nepal) funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, HEI ICI programme. The main goal of the programme was to strengthen the expertise of Tribhuvan University in order to establish an open and distance learning system, and thereby to provide more flexible studying possibilities to teachers who are already working. This publication provides viewpoints, concepts and some practices that have been discussed and worked on with the personnel of Tribhuvan University during the workshops. The concept of learning and pedagogy forms the foundation for the development of education. Therefore, the issue of learning shows as a cross-cutting theme in the articles. Furthermore, the context of the development of open and distance learning has a fundamental impact on the content of the development work. In the case of Nepal, the technology infrastructure is still rather weak and, therefore, starting from the basics reflects from the articles.The writers were the experts in the above-mentioned project from JAMK and Häme Universities of Applied Sciences. The writers of the articles cover their role and expertise areas in the project.

The overall aim of the Egyptian Twinning project described here was to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of the National Authority for Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Education (NAQAAE) in line with the relevant European best practices. The soul of Twinning is, however, about cooperation between people. Accordingly, the project stood for strengthening partner- ship between experts and institutions in Egypt, Finland and Germany. It was not about replicating European systems but rather seeking the best practices of all and for all. Solving complex challenges always raises possibilities for everyone to learn more: about the content itself through theories and their manifold applications for diverse practices, but also about organisations and cultures besides international cooperation, collegiality, friendship and ourselves as persons and experts in a multidimensional global world. In the texts here, the authors tell about their experiences of all of these.
Open and Distance Learning is one mean to provide learning opportunities and to implement the idea of equal opportunities and the right to education. This publication focuses on the development of open and distance learning at Tribhuvan University in Nepal, in which there was a need to establish a new mode of learning for the population that is working. This publication describes the basis from which the structures, strategies and teaching and learning processes of open and distance learning were created and implemented for the first time at Tribhuvan University.The development collaboration that this publication focuses on concerns the Training of Trainers for the Teacher Qualification Upgrading Programme in Nepal (ToT Nepal) funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, HEI ICI programme. The main goal of the programme was to strengthen the capacity of Tribhuvan University to establish an open and distance learning system.

This Discussion Paper critically examines local governance in the Niger Delta and its relevance to the search for inclusive and sustainable conflict-resolution in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It critiques the existing local government system and explores the possibility of reconceptualising local governance along more inclusive, accountable and participatory lines that would institutionalise democracy, development and peace at the grassroots or community level in the troubled oil-rich region. Its originality lies in its departure from top-down perspectives, and its refocusing of attention on the oft-neglected local sites of conflict and under development. The paper will appeal to scholars, policy actors and development planners with a particular interest in developments at the African grassroots level.
