This paper briefly examines the exchange rate arrangements of several of Eastern Europe's transition economies.Generally speaking, countries that have included some form of fixed exchange rate regime in their stabilization packages have been more successful in curbing inflation, and consequently reviving output. Further, while a fixed exchange rate is no panacea for economic problems, it can act as a credible nominal anchor in a comprehensive reform package.Such credibility, however, is contingent on the government's ability to implement a balanced budget. As transition progresses, fixed exchange rate regimes eventually become outmoded as they lack some of the flexibility and potency in conducting monetary policy central banks may require as the economy grows.To date, even the most advanced of the transition countries have balked at making this switch.A possible explanation may simply be inertia from past success of fixed exchange rates in reducing inflation and enhancing the credibility of such central banks. .

According to the latest reports of United Nations, the biggest challenge facing the world at the  present and in the next decades is water scarcity. Trans-boundary water resources from history to  present either lead to cooperation or to confrontation and conflicts.  For the last six decades, it has not been possible to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the water  issue has been raised as one of the keys for solving the conflict or having a successful discussion.  The history of the water conflict in the Middle East began by the foundation of the Israeli state in  1948. Since that time Israelis have tried to secure the state water supplies using different water  resources in the area. The rapidly growth of the driving forces (Nexus) has become a source of  numerous conflicts with their neighbours.  The whole area has suffered from water shortage and unsuccessful managing of the water  resources. Palestinians, Israelis, Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese are sharing the major part of  their water resources, the Jordan River and the aquifer of the West Bank and Garza Strip being  the main sources of water resources for Israelis and for the Palestinians. Dividing the land will  not be a solution to water gaps. It is likely to make the situation even worse.  Several methods and tools have been developed worldwide to assist the riparians to manage their  own shared water resources, part of which are technical and other social -political methods.  Scarcity index is one technical numerical method developed to assist the parties to allocate the  shared water resources and to assist on recovering the water gaps. Based on the mentioned  methods numerous agreements have been made and discussions have been held between the  riparians to achieve peace and co-operation. Some of them have been implemented, the other  remain open due to the political changes in the area.

The article discusses transcendence in music in relation to popular Sufi performances in East Africa, drawing on specific cases from Zanzibar. Based on fieldwork, it examines ways in which music and movement in a structured event or performance can affect the consciousness. This phenomenon is discussed in close connection to its increasing presence in popular music festivals. The article also addresses the latent conflict between the performative Sufi orders of Islamic faith and the more conservative and increasingly silent Muslims.

Accession to the EU is one of the biggest challenges for the CEECs in the coming years.Sound and sustainable public finances are crucial for the transformation towards a market economy to be continued (completed), as well as for the country's ability to comply with the membership requirements.As the long-term macroeconomic stability depends heavily on sound and sustainable fiscal balances, the structural reforms that will strengthen public finances should be a task of a highest priority for applicant countries.  The measurement of the budgetary position in transition economies presents important difficulties, as the quality and comparability of statistics is still poor, and as those less visible forms of fiscal deficit (i.e. the quasi-fiscal deficit and the contingent deferred fiscal deficit) are clearly linked with the postponements in structural reforms.  Furthermore, there is unquestioned interdependence between fiscal policy (budgetary aggregates) and the transition process (changes in macro- and microeconomic performance of the country).Indeed, one can hardly expect a successful balanced-budget policy during the entire journey from plan to market.To the extent that fiscal imbalances reflect the costs of necessary adjustments, they may be temporarily justified (as 'transitional' deficits).Thus, the most difficult issue in designing and implementing fiscal policy during transition is choosing a proper balance between the need to achieve macroeconomic stability (which require fiscal discipline) and the need to pursue structural, market-oriented (and fiscally costly) reforms.In practice, in the short run, this can lead to conflicts between quality and quantity of fiscal adjustment.  When the quality of fiscal adjustment is poor, the current 'good' quantities are not the evidence of sound public finances.Slow progress in structural reforms, which is not fully reflected in current budgetary aggregates, poses a risk of future fiscal imbalances and constitutes a threat to macroeconomic stabilization and sustainable growth.Therefore, further progress in restructuring the economy and reducing the role that the state plays in production and resource allocation remain the main challenges for sustainable fiscal position in transition economies.   The current levels of government spending in the relatively poor transition countries are much too excessive.The need to finance high government spending (strongly dominated by current transfers) makes impossible the reduction of the overall heavy fiscal burden on the economy.Such a burden creates a strong barrier to fast growth and leads to the development of the underground economy.  With this unfavourable current situation any pressure on the expenditure side will deteriorate fiscal position.Such pressures will derive from the continuous progress in structural reform as well as from the process of the preparation to accession.  As discussed in this paper, the budget deficit, as usually measured, has important shortcomings as an indicator of sound and sustainable public finances in transition economies.But this does not mean that fiscal imbalances are the matter of irrelevance. Instead, the medium term reform programs should address the need to reduce the fiscal deficit, but this goal can be achieved only by reshaping government expenditure with priorities given to productive activities (such as investment in infrastructure and in human capital), together with reducing the size of public spending.   Keywords: budget, deficit, European Union, fiscal policy .

Privatizing Eastern Europe : the role of markets and ownership in the transition
The authors present the results of the 1995 Bank of Finland survey (previous surveys were 1991 and 1993) on Finnish direct investments to the CIS, the Baltics and other CEE countries.The survey describes the situation during or at the end of 1994 and focuses mainly on Estonia and Russia, the main targets of Finnish direct investment in Eastern Europe. The results indicate that most Finnish direct investment went to service industries - only about a third went to other sectors. Direct investment was generally in the form of equity capital, while about a third was in the form of loans.The level of local banking services and the availability of credit appeared to be fairly low in Russia and Estonia.Investor experiences were described most often 'tolerable' in Russia and 'satisfactory' in Estonia.The future expectations of investors, in comparison with the results of the previous survey two years ago, remained positive and unchanged in Estonia, but somewhat less favourable than 1993 for Russia.Excessive, arbitrary bureaucracy was considered a major drawback by nearly all respondents. The authors draw attention to current problems with data collection and data quality.Presently, there is apparently nobody who can accurately specify the number of enterprises under Finnish ownership actually operating in Russia or Estonia. Keywords: direct investment, Russia, Estonia, Eastern Europe .

The Middle East : a political and economic survey
About 62 percent of Finland's current surface area has been covered by the waters of the Baltic basin at some stage. The highest shorelines are located at a present altitude of about 220 metres above sea level in the north and 100 metres above sea level in the south-east. The nature of the Baltic Sea has alternated in the course of its four main postglacial stages between a freshwater lake and a brackish water basin connected to the outside ocean by narrow straits. This article provides a general overview of the principal stages in the history of the Baltic Sea and examines the regional influence of the associated shore displacement phenomena within Finland. The maps depicting the various stages have been generated digitally by GIS techniques.Following deglaciation, the freshwater Baltic Ice Lake (12,600-10,300 BP) built up against the ice margin to reach a level 25 metres above that of the ocean, with an outflow through the straits of Öresund. At this stage the only substantial land areas in Finland were in the east and south-east. Around 10,300 BP this ice lake discharged through a number of channels that opened up in central Sweden until it reached the ocean level, marking the beginning of the mildly saline Yoldia Sea stage (10,300-9500 BP). As the connecting channels rose above sea level, however, the Baltic Sea became confined once more, to form the Ancylus Lake (9500-8000 BP). During its existence the outflow channel to the ocean shifted to the Straits of Denmark and the major lake systems of central Finland became isolated from the Baltic basin. After the brief Mastogloia transition phase, a greater influx of saline water began to take place through the Straits of Denmark, marking the Litorina Sea stage (7500- 4000 BP), to be followed by a somewhat less saline stage known as the Limnea Sea. After a transgressive period early in the Litorina Sea stage, shoreline displacement in Finland has proceeded at a steadily declining rate.

The subject of this article is East-West integration.Part two examines the issue of integration between East and West by introducing the club theory as applied to international relations.The general assumption of the club theory is that the costs and benefits are a function of the size of the club and that the club size will be expanded till the marginal costs equal the marginal benefits.Part three examines the concrete benefits and costs of EU enlargement.There are economic and political gains, budgetary costs, voting and migration effects involved in the integration between East and West.Finally, part four discusses visions and realism of further integration and suggestions for interim policies while achieving an integrated Europe. .
Business restructuring in Asia : cross-border M&As in the crisis period
Since the Copenhagen and Essen Summits in June 1993 and December 1994, there has been a consensus on eastern enlargement.Central and Eastern European countries have been shown the green light in terms of accession.However, questions of when and how remain open for discussion.The main elements of the accession strategy appear in the Europe Agreements on economic cooperation, the White Paper on approximation of laws, the Phare programme of economic aid to the associated countries and structured dialogue.  At the moment, the aspirant members are not ready to take on the complex set of rules ranging from minimum social and environmental standards in the single market to the application of competition law.  In respect to transition development, markets already finction reasonably well in most CEECs.However, in several areas of economic activity, effective and transparent corporate governance and appropriate standards for conducting business still have a long way to go.This applies, in particular, to enterprise restructuring, strengthening of financial institutions, commercialisation of infrastructure and environmental protection. Furthermore, many changes in legal structures are still required. Regrading to macroeconomic stabilisation, progress towards stability continues, growth remains relatively strong and inflation has declined.Nevertheless, increasing trade deficits, real exchange rate appreciation and signs of a deterioration in international competitiveness may lower growth.In addition, expectations concerning wage increases, further liberalisation of administered prices, money supply growth caused by high interest rates, and growth of credits to enterprises are to fuell inflation in the future.  From the EU's point of view, the official framework for admission to the EU involves, among others, the Commission preparing an opinion (avis) on the applicant's ability to acceppt the body of EU law (aquis communautaire).Furthermore, the Commission must prepare a report on the EU's financial framework covering the early years of the next century and likely effects of enlargement.Finally, before enlargement can take place, the Intergovernmental Conference must succeed in streamlining EU decision-making and institutions, extending EU responsibility for joint foreign and defence policies and improving cooperation in home affairs matters.  The EU has grown to fifteen members through four enlargements. Monetary integration is currently scheduled for 1999 and given the amount of effort made, there seems no way turning back.Monetary union is considered a logical extension of the single market and therefore, enlargement cannot be pursued at the expense of monetary union.Only after monetary union has started functioning, concrete actions can be taken in terms of enlargement.  Keywords: Integration, Central and Eastern Europe, the Europe Agreements, The European Union, the European Monetary Union, eastern enlargement. .

The theoretical literature suggests four criteria for judging whether regions should form a currency area: mobility of labour and capital, flexibility of prices and wages, openness to trade and diversity of production.Regions that have relatively closed economies, narrow product ranges, strong price and wage rigidities, and low external mobility of labour and capital should not join monetary union, but should instead retain exchange-rate flexibility.  According to Maastricht Treaty, countries wishing to join EMU must fulfil the convergence criteria on interest rate levels, exchange rates, price stability and public debt.Several studies indicate that neither current EU-members nor the Central and Eastern European countries fully satisfy Mundell's criteria for optimal currency area (OCA) or EMU convergence criteria.Therefore, a European monetary union might run more smoothly if limited to a subset of EU members.  European Union is less of an optimal currency area than, for example, the US, due to lower factor mobility, more variable real exchange rates and slower response to aggregate shocks.Regarding to convergence criteria, it seems that the majoriy of the EU-countries satisfy the criteria to price stability whereas more efforts are needed where public debt is concerned.In respect of Central and Eastern European countries, the successful conclusion of systematic transformation and market oriented structural reforms is essential before participation in EMU.At present, countries should concentrate on maintaining their commitment to stabilization and on development further modern monetary and fiscal policies. Furthermore, they must complete financial sector reform, and liberalize capital movements.In addition, their central banks have to become fully independent and have price stability as primary objective.Actions should be taken to tackle factors that hinder the efficiency of monetary policy e.g. the volatility of money demand, the poor degree of privatization and competition in the banking sector, the non-existence of a enforcable bankruptcy law, the lack of development of money and securities markets and the problem "bad loans" in the banking sector.  Endogineity of OCA criteria argues that suitability of European countries, both Western and Eastern, for EMU cannot be judged on the basis of historical data since the structure of these economies is likely to change in EMU.The more countries integrate with each other, the more highly correlated will be their business cycles. Therefore, if a country, failing the OCA criteria now, goes ahead and joins EMU anyway, its trade linkages and income correlation with other EMU members are likely to rise as a consequence of entry into EMU.  Keywords: EMU, OCA, integration, transition, Central and Eastern Europe, enlargement .

This study looks at the interplay between European Monetary Union (EMU) and a future EU enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe. The country focus is on the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.The analysis concludes that EMU is improving the framework conditions for a future Eastern enlargement. Moreover, EMU in itself is becoming ever more relevant to the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe: The introduction of the euro and these countries' subsequent accession to the EU will alter their monetary and exchange rate policy frameworks.The EMU convergence criteria will not play a major role in the EU accession process.However, in the preaccession period, they should be viewed as medium- and longer-term points of reference for stability-oriented economic policymaking. .

Biblical scholars have long claimed that the Israelites "could not conceive of a disembodied nefesh [soul]." In this book, Richard C. Steiner rejects that claim based on a broad spectrum of textual, linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence spanning the millennia from prehistoric times to the present. The biblical evidence includes a prophecy of Ezekiel condemning women who pretend to trap the wandering souls of sleeping people - prophecy that has been only partially understood until now because of the obscure technical terms that it contains. The extrabiblical evidence suggests that a belief in the existence of disembodied souls was part of the common religious heritage of the peoples of the ancient Near East.--Provided by publisher.
