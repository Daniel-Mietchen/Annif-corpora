Motorsport is not just about the spectacle of some of the world's most popular and famous sporting events - it also plays a crucial role in developing new techniques and technologies. Each unit in the IMI and EAL level 2 courses are covered in full, and the chapters can be easily matched to the BTEC First course structure. The book covers introductory topics in motorsport from vehicle science and maths through the basics of vehicle maintenance to pre and post race inspections.

Tyre pressure on trucks
The purpose of this thesis was to conduct a research concerning the stock location opti-mization in the warehouse of tire manufacturing facility for Goodyear EMEA, located in Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg. The main goal for the research was to find out and determine tires in the warehouse stock, which are so called fast movers defined by their volumes and shipping frequency and therefore determine optimal locations for these tires in order to enhance the logistics operations in the warehouse. The research was conducted by limiting the affiliated facilities in EMEA to only those, which manufac-ture truck tires in order to maintain proper scale for the research.  Theoretical framework of the research is divided respectively into two main parts. Part A explains the theory and analysis behind the stock location optimization from the local warehouse perspective and the process leading to stock location optimization research, which involved data analysis of stock movements which were compared to current stock locations. Part A therefore explains the activities and operations in Luxembourg facility and the analysis of the chosen tires, their volumes, shipping frequencies and their current stock location. Part B examines the external environment inside EMEA by focusing to the stock transfers and frequencies between other manufacturing facilities into Goodyear Luxembourg. Part B describes the relation between facilities and importance of analyzing the tire shipping between them and Luxembourg. Part segregation is for a reason to separate external and internal environments and demonstrate their interconnection to stock location optimization.  Quantitative research methods were mainly used to gather data to analyze stock movements, transfers and current stock, in order to determine the fast movers and their current locations. Analyzing was conducted primarily by Excel PIVOT tool and with coordination of Goodyear EMEA supply chain team.  The results from the research lead to implementation of new stock locations for variety of tires, which was the eventual tangible goal set by employing company, Goodyear S.A. The research works also as a template and guidebook for future stock location optimization in the GDTO Luxembourg.
