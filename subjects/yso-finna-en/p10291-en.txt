The article discusses transcendence in music in relation to popular Sufi performances in East Africa, drawing on specific cases from Zanzibar. Based on fieldwork, it examines ways in which music and movement in a structured event or performance can affect the consciousness. This phenomenon is discussed in close connection to its increasing presence in popular music festivals. The article also addresses the latent conflict between the performative Sufi orders of Islamic faith and the more conservative and increasingly silent Muslims.

"The author of the Epistle on Sufism, Abu 'l-Qasim al-Qushayri (376/986-465/1074), was a famous Sunni scholar and mystic (Sufi) from Khurasan in Iran. His Epistle is probably the most popular Sufi manual ever." "Written in 437/1045, it has served as a primary textbook for many generations of Sufi novices down to the present. Al-Qushayri has given us an illuminating insight into the everyday lives of Sufi devotees of the eighth to eleventh centuries C.E. and the moral and ethical dilemmas they were facing in trying to strike a delicate balance between their ascetic and mystical convictions and the exigencies of life in a society governed by rank, wealth, and military power." "In al-Qushayri's narrative, the Sufi 'friends of God' (awaliya') are depicted as the true, if uncrowned, 'kings' of this world, not those worldly rulers who appear to be lording it over the common herd of believers. Yet, even the most advanced Sufi masters should not take salvation for granted. Miracle-working, no matter how spectacular, cannot guarantee the Sufi a 'favorite outcome' in the afterlife, for it may be but a ruse on the part of God who wants to test the moral integrity of his servant. In the Epistle these and many other Sufi motifs are illustrated by the anecdotes and parables that show al-Qushayri's fellow Sufis in a wide variety of contexts: suffering from hunger and thirst in the desert, while performing pilgrimage to Mecca, participating in 'spiritual concerts', reciting the Qur'an, waging war against the 'infidel' enemy and their own desires, earning their livelihood, meditating in a retreat, praying, working miracles, interacting with the 'people of the market-place', their family members and peers, dreaming, and dying."--Jacket.
The last barrier : a journey into the essence of Sufi teachings
The articles in this volume build up ethnographic analysis complementary to the historiography of South Asian Islam, which has explored the emergence of reformism in the context of specific political and religious circumstances of nineteenth-century British India. Taking up diverse popular and scholarly debates as well as everyday religious practices, this volume also breaks away from the dominant trend of mainstream ethnographic work, which celebrates Sufi-inspired forms of Islam as tolerant, plural, authentic and so on, pitted against a 'reformist' Islam. Urging a more nuanced examination of all forms of reformism and their reception in practice, the contributions here powerfully demonstrate the historical and geographical specificities of reform projects. In doing so, they challenge prevailing perspectives in which substantially different traditions of reform are lumped together into one reified category (often carelessly shorthanded as 'wah'habism') and branded as extremist - if not altogether demonised as terrorist.

Quest for the Red Sulphur: The Life of Ibn Arabi is undoubtedly a landmark in Ibn Arabi studies. Until the publication of this book, anyone who wanted to learn about the life of Ibn Arabi has had little choice of material to work from. This major study by Claude Addas is based on a detailed analysis of a whole range of Ibn Arabi's own writings as well as a vast amount of secondary literature in both Arabic and Persian. The result is the first-ever attempt to reconstruct what proves to have been a double itinerary: on the one hand, the journey that took Ibn Arabi from his native Andalusia to Damascus - and on the other hand, the 'Night Journey' which carried him along the paths of asceticism and prayer to the ultimate stage of revelation of his mystic quest. --Provided by publisher.
Making space : Sufis and settlers in early modern India
"This book discusses the understandings of gender and Islam in pesantren and Sufi orders in Indonesia. It contributes to the decolonization of the anthropology of Islam in Indonesia, confronting ideological and intellectual tropes of (neo)-colonialism in two ways. Firstly, it deconstructs categories denying the "authenticity" of Indonesian Islams on the basis of comparison with the Arab Middle East, and secondly, it critically examines the salience of expatriate and diasporic Middle Eastern Muslim feminist discourses and secular western feminist analyses in Indonesian contexts"--
Living sufism
Addresses the rise and inner life of the Egyptian pietist movement in the first half of the thirteenth century, calling attention to the Sufi subtext of Jewish pietism without reducing its spiritual synthesis and religious renewal to a set of political calculations.--

The book tries to demonstrate the scientific reality of Islamic spirituality and clarify the misunderstandings and confusions about Islamic spirituality on scientific grounds. Scientific orthodoxy refers to magnetic sensitivity in human beings, electromagnetic energies that permeate our atmosphere, the flow of positive and negative ions in the atmosphere affecting human brain activity, the function of the pineal gland and many other empirical sources of transcendent experience that are yet to be investigated. This magnetic energy basis of spiritual experience, which the scientific camp has been forced into revealing, has proved to be a welcome development of modern science from the point of view of Islamic spirituality.

Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn 'Arabī (1165-1240) was a hugely influential figure in the development of Sufism, yet although interest in his work continues to grow, his poetry has received very little attention. This book is the first full-length monograph devoted to his Dīwān (collected poems). It begins by attempting to define Ibn 'Arabī's poetic style and his understanding of poetics, which is closely intertwined with his metaphysics: the rhythms of poetry echo those of creation, and meaning combines with form just as the spirit descends on matter. Drawing on a pre-Islamic theme, he insists that his poetry was revealed to him word for word by a spirit. At the same time, however, his attitude to the function of poetry and its relation to scripture is closer to mainstream medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian theology than has usually been thought. Denis E. McAuley focuses on close readings of books in unusual verse forms, including poetic responses to chapters of the Qur'an; imitations of earlier poets; poems that use only one rhyme word; and a cycle of poems modelled on the letters of the alphabet. In so doing, he makes frequent comparisons with other Islamic and European poets from the sixth century to the dawn of the twentieth, many of them virtually unstudied. Ibn 'Arabī emerges as a highly original poet whose work casts afresh light on the period and on classical Arabic literature as a whole.

Judaism, Sufism, and the pietists of medieval Egypt : a study of Abraham Maimonides and his times
Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt' addresses the extraordinary rise and inner life of the Egyptian pietist movement in the first half of the thirteenth century. The creative engagement with the dominant Islamic culture was always present, even when unspoken. Dr Russ-Fishbane calls attention to the Sufi subtext of Jewish pietiem, while striving not to reduce its spiritual synthesis and religious renewal to a set of political calculations. Ultimately, no single term or concept can fully address the creative expression of pietism that so animated Jewish society and that left its mark in numerous manuscripts and fragments from medieval Egypt. Russ-Fishbane offers a nuanced examination of the pietist sources on their own terms, drawing as far as possible upon their own definitions and perceptions. Jewish society in thirteenth-century Egypt reflects the dynamic reexamination by a venerable community of its foundational texts and traditions, even of its very identity and institutions, viewed and reviewed in the full light of its Islamic environment. The historical legacy of this religious synthesis belongs at once to the realm of Jewish culture, in all its diversity and dynamism, as well as to the broader spiritual orbit of Islamicate civilization.--
