Minimum wage policies as well as the business practice of outsourcing have important implications for the labor market outcomes of (primarily) lowskilled labor. This paper concerns optimal redistributive income taxation and provision of a public input in a twotype model with a minimum wage policy implemented for the lowability type. We assume that firms use part of their resources for outsourcing by locating part of the production process abroad. Our results show that desire to relax the selfselection constraint and the incentive to increase employment among lowability agents reinforce each other in terms of marginal income taxation. In addition, the appearance of equilibrium unemployment provides an incentive for the government to directly tax outsourcing. Without a direct instrument for taxing outsourcing, the government may reduce the amount of resources spent on outsourcing by increased provision of the public input good which is desirable for two reasons, as reduced outsourcing contributes to less wage inequality and increased employment.
