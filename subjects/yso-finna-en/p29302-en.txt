In this anthology of short stories by contemporary Kannada women writers, the editor has put together representative voices of last three decades. The authors included here come from variety of communities, from diverse cultural and regional backgrounds and draw on different literary influences in creating their own writing styles. Two of the authors are based outside Karnataka,in the metropolis of Mumbai, several are based in the now very cosmopolitan Bangalore, while others live in small cities and towns through out Karnataka. Some of the authors are academics, while others are professionals and yet others are homemakers. Among these stories there are several that bear the mark of modern style that dominated Kannada writing in the mid 20th century. There are others that are influenced by more recent politically charged literary movements such as the dalit assertion. Kruti R. is a sociologist by training and she has been active in the worlds of literature, theatre and arts.
