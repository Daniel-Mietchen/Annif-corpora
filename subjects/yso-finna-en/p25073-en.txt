"Preface Over the decades, much of the literature has focused on the biology and ecological aspects of algae found in freshwater, marine, and brackish environments. These organisms are also known to inhabit various other environments on Earth. More recently, there has been a substantial shift toward the concept of sustainable development and the "green economy" with emphasis on exploiting biological systems for the benefit of mankind. This underpins the fundamentals of the field of biotechnology, which has revolutionized various fields including agriculture, food, pharmaceutical and medical sciences, environmental sciences, and industrial feedstock, thus positively impacting most spheres of human endeavor. Algae--but more specifically, microalgae--have been associated with problematic events such as algal blooms caused by eutrophication of aquatic environments and in some cases the toxins produced have serious health impacts on the aquatic environment, plants, animals, and humans. However, these events are largely due to human activities resulting in the proliferation of nutrients in aquatic environments. The significance of algae cannot be underestimated as they contribute to approximately 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere, are the original source of fossil fuels, and are the primary producers in the oceans. Therefore, there is potential for exploitation of this invaluable biomass source that could lead to definite environmental and economic benefits for man"--
Developing Biofuel Production from Food Industry Wastes in the Rural Area of Kenya.
This PhD research focused on the problem of social sustainability in biodiesel programmes in Brazil and Timor-Leste. An enthusiastic yet inexperienced researcher, Sarina Kilham designed a two-country, multi-language, qualitative research project that incorporated action research, co-researchers, quantitative farm surveys, participant interviews and farm observations, which were video recorded to create a research documentary.

As feedstocks to refineries change, there must be an accompanying change in refinery technology. This means a movement from conventional means of refining heavy feedstocks using (typically) coking technologies to more innovative processes that will coax the last drips of liquid fuels from the feedstock. This book presents the evolution of refinery processes during the last century and as well as the means by which refinery processes will evolve during the next three-to-five decades. Chapters contain material relevant to (1) comparisons of current feedstocks with heavy oil and bio-feedstocks; (2) evolution of refineries since the 1950s, (3) properties and refinability of heavy oil and bio-feedstocks, (4) thermal processes vs. hydroprocesses, and (5) evolution of products to match the environmental market. Process innovations that have influenced refinery processing over the past three decades are presented, as well as the relevant patents that have the potential for incorporation into future refineries.-- back cover.

This book extensively covers the different types of biomass (e.g. molasses, sugar beet pulp, cheese whey, sugarcane residues, palm waste, vegetable oil, straws, stalks and wood), various pretreatment approaches (e.g. physical, thermal, chemical, physicochemical and biological) and methods that show the subsequent production of biofuels and chemicals such as sugars, ethanol, extracellular polysaccharides, biodiesel, gas and oil. In addition to traditional methods such as steam, hot-water, hydrothermal, diluted-acid, organosolv, ozonolysis, sulfite, milling, fungal and bacterial, microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, torrefaction, pelletization, gasification (including biogas) and liquefaction pretreatments, it also introduces and discusses novel techniques such as nano and solid catalysts, organic electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids. This book offers a review of state-of-the-art research and provides guidance for the future paths of developing pretreatment techniques of biomass for biofuels, especially in the fields of biotechnology, microbiology, chemistry, materials science and engineering.
With a focus on ecology, economy and engine performance, diesel engines are explored in relation to current research and developments. The prevalent trends in this development are outlined with particular focus on the most frequently used alternative fuels in diesel engines; the properties of various type of biodiesel and the concurrent improvement of diesel engine characteristics using numeric optimization alongside current investigation and research work in the field. Following of a short overview of engine control, aftertreatment and alternative fuels, Green Diesel Engine explores the effects of biodiesel usage on injection, fuel spray, combustion, and tribology characteristics, and engine performance. Additionally, optimization procedures of diesel engine characteristics are discussed using practical examples and each topic is corroborated and supported by current research and detailed illustrations. This thorough discussion provides a solid foundation in the current research but also a starting point for fresh ideas for engineers involved in developing/adjusting diesel engines for usage of alternative fuels, researchers in renewable energy, as well as to engineers, advanced undergraduates, and postgraduates.
