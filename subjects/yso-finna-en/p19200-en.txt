Abstract: Rapidly evolving technology of digital printing opens new opportunities on many markets. One of them is the printed fabric market where printing companies as well as clients benefit from new printing methods. This thesis focuses on the digital textile printing technology and its implementation for fabric-on-demand printing service in Finland. The purpose of this project was to study the technology behind digital textile printing, areas of application of this technology, the requirements for the digital printing on fabrics and the economical aspects of the new technology. Based on the study a tentative business plan for a small digital textile printing company taking advantage of the Internet as a service deployment platform was created. The thesis is based on a literature review of several printed sources, numerous internet articles and up-to-date presentations on digital printing. A business plan for the digital textile printing service in Finland was created as the result of this project. According to the information gathered, it is economically feasible for a start-up to operate with its own printing facilities consisting of two low-end digital textile printing ink jet printers. However, the demand for the service in Finland is still the subject for further studies.
