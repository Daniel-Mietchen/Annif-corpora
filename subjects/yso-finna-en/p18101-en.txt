juristic person legal person
"Several current international legal issues are related to the concept of legal personality, including the determination of international rights and duties of non-state actors and the legal capacities of transnational institutions. When addressing these issues, different understandings of legal personality are employed. These concepts consider different entities to be international persons, state different criteria for becoming one and attach different consequences to being one. Roland Portmann systematizes the different positions on international personality by spelling out the assumptions on which they rest and examining how they were substantiated in legal practice. He puts forward the argument that positions on international personality which strongly emphasize the role of states or effective actors rely on assumptions that have been discarded in present international law. The principal argument is that international law has to be conceived as an open system, wherein there is no presumption for or against certain entities enjoying international personality"--

The aim of the research is to identify what result brings the balancing between the protection of personal data and the protection of intellectual property rights undertaken by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its recent jurisprudence. The research should explain three main questions: first, why the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses belong to the personal data. Second, if it would be legitimate to place the liability for identifying and blocking the IPR infringements on the internet service providers only Third, what is the rationale for the position of the CJEU not to accept such claims of IPR holders. The author searches to find out whether the CJEU jurisprudence indicates that there is a certain hierarchy between data protection and IPR protection..

"This book examines the birth of the European individual as a juridical problem. Focusing on six legal case dossiers from the European Court of Justice which, doctrinally, concern the legitimacy of states derogation from the free-movement rights of workers the book treats these as an electrifying laboratory for the study of law and society The concrete individuals whose cases the book analyses are a scientologist, a dangerous gunman, a provocative trade-unionist, a rogue pimp, a drug dealer, and two prostitutes. These delinquent individuals each expelled from one of the Member States thus provide the raw material for constructing the idea of the European individual. Foucaults story of the modern subject constitutes the books main theoretical inspiration, as it considers the encounter between legal and other practices within a more general field of juridical power: a network of active relations, between different social spheres. The European individual, it is argued, emerged out of this field and its practices of knowledge power at the intersection of regimes of law, economy and security. "
