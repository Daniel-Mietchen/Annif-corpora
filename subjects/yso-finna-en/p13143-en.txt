Today, digital imaging is widely used in dentistry. In medical radiography, the importance of displays and room illuminance has been shown in many studies, whereas the effect of these factors in the diagnosis of dental radiography is not clear and remains controversial. There is limited knowledge among dentists as to how observer performance is affected by the type of display, level of ambient light or grayscale calibration. The aim of this thesis was to compare observer performance in the detection of both anatomical structures and pathology in panoramic and bitewing radiographs using consumer grade display with γ 2.2- and DICOM-calibration, a tablet (3rd generation Apple iPad® and a 6 MegaPixel (MP) display under different lighting conditions. Furthermore, the thesis aimed at providing recommendations for type of display and acceptable illuminance levels in the room for interpretation of dental radiographs.Thirty panoramic and bitewing radiographs were randomly evaluated on four displays under bright (510 lx) and dim (16 lx) ambient lighting by two observers. Both anatomical structures and pathology were evaluated because they provided both low- and high-contrast structure. Consensus was considered as reference. Intra- and inter-observer agreement was determined. The proportion of equivalent ratings and weighted kappa were used to assess the reliability. The level of significance was set to P<0.05.DICOM calibration may improve observer performance in the detection of pathology in panoramic radiographs regardless of the room illuminance level. DICOM calibration improves the detection of enamel and dentinal caries in bitewing radiographs, particularly in bright lighting conditions. On the other hand, in dental practice the room illuminance level is often higher, and it is thus recommended that the overall lighting level should be decreased. Furthermore, a DICOM-calib rated consumer grade display can be used instead of a medical display in dental practice without compromising the diagnostic quality and it saves costs. Tablet displays are recommended to use with care in dental radiography.
