Now in its fourth edition, Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local remains the same groundbreaking book when it first debuted its collection of outstanding scholars in examining the changing transnational landscape of education. With the addition of new coeditor Stephen Franz, the book provides new perspectives on the dynamic interplay of global, national, and local forces as they shape the functions and outcomes of education systems. The book calls for a rethinking of the nation-state as the basic unit for analyzing school-society relations and emphasizes the need to study social movements in relation to educational reforms. It also emphasizes the value of feminist, postcolonial, and culturally sensitive perspectives for inquiry into the potential of education systems to contribute to individual development and social change. This new edition incorporates recent developments in scholarship, especially in education policy and practice, the impact of the global economic crisis, and a new chapter on education in the European Union.

Experienced international companies would agree that successful performance in the home country or in the particular market doesn’t guarantee a success in a new one. For that reason, Finnish company Cubicasa Ltd., that desires to grow internationally, is interested to gather information of new markets. Accordingly the aim of the thesis research is to evaluate the reasonability to the company to enter Lithuanian market by providing relevant information and precise data of the new market. In order to provide good and precise information for the case company, qualitative approach and case study method was chosen. For the theory part the books written by authors P.Kotler, B. Rosenbloom, G. Johnson, K.Keller were used. For the empirical part the primary data was collected by interviewing potential customers from Lithuania. Secondary data was gathered by using electronic research as relevant information is delivered on the web pages of institutions, organizations and companies. In order to answer to the research questions, the first part of the thesis was divided into two parts for macro and micro environments analysis. PESTEL and Porter’s five forces frameworks were used. Second part of the thesis was concentrated on marketing strategy. Potential customers were classified by segmentation, targeting and positioning analysis. Finally, marketing mix as the main tool to answer research questions was used. The background knowledge for this thesis was gathered during the lectures at Oulu University of Applied Science such as international business, marketing, intercultural skills. The research work implemented under the guidance of the lecturer Outi Sutinen. The subject for thesis was provided by the Cubicasa Ltd company during the meeting at the TUNNI event. Further discussions were held with founder of the company Mikko Perälä and head of product development Jarmo Lumpus. Lastly, in case if Cubicasa decides that Lithuanian market is attractive and worth to enter, it is advisable to apply given information and recommendations for the successful entry in the Lithuanian market.

Kanali - from Rauma to the world : Learning international business competence by doing
The last decade has witnessed the rise of a great number of transnational social movements and activist networks. While many of these movements have been initiated in the North, some are driven by people from the Global South with the aim of addressing various forms of destitution and asserting a variety of basic economic and cultural rights. Such transnational organizing is increasingly evident in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of these initiatives relate particularly to the growing numbers of people depending on forms of informal work for survival. This edition of Current African Issues looks into the transnationalization of a local association of informal workers as it becomes involved in an international network of grassroots organizations. While this transnational engagement opens up new political possibilities, it also poses new challenges. Participation in international activities is highly unequal and mediated rather than direct, as influential actors engage in practices of gate-keeping that tend to work to the disadvantage of women. Tensions also emerged as a result of the divergent gender ideologies espoused by different participants. The paper draws on various theoretical perspectives on spatial politics in the global age to interrogate the unequal and contested spatialities of this transnational activism. Feminist scholarship sheds further light on the gendering processes at work in the transnationalization of a grassroots association.

COOPERATION BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR SERVICES
Abstract: Strategic alliance is considered today as a natural and common alternative to employ when a firm plans to enter a new market with a stable and secure basis. In fact strategic alliance is more preferred entry option compared to acquisitions around the world across all industries. In alliances, like in all international operations there are risks, however many theorists as well as companies have understood the value of operating with a partner. Fira Oy (further referred to as 'Fira'), a construction firm in Finland has realised the potential in new markets and has decided to execute this prospect through strategic alliance with a local partner. Fira has done market research particularly in the Swedish market. It is a usual path for a Finnish company to expand its operations into the neighbouring economy. Alliances have been studied theoretically and practically for years, yet still no clear model for success exists. This research ties the theoretical points of view with practise together to advice Fira in entering a new market through strategic alliance. The framework for the research is organised in the following manner: Different theoretical strategic alliance modes are compared to find the most suitable for Fira and its operations. The second part of the research is to construct a partner profile by analysing the strategic and cultural characteristics of Fira. A cultural analysis is conducted to show the viewpoint of the employees toward Fira's company culture. From the results a partner culture fitting Fira is identified. The profile includes the strategic goals as well as the strategic capabilities the partner has to have. The strategic capabilities are discovered through a value chain analysis. Furthermore, the complementary capabilities to be performed by the partner for the alliance are determined. The final part of this research is risk in alliances. As mentioned above, there is risk in all international operations. In alliances companies often think it is reduced by half since the partner is responsible for half of the risk. However, risks often increase in other operational and environmental elements, making the risk factor one of the most significant factors to be considered when entering an alliance. The objective of this research is to construct a strategic alliance model for Fira, a construction business entering the Swedish market. The framework forms a basis for any international strategic alliance Fira considers to join in the future.
