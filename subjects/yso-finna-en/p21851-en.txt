immigrant background
What is happening to young adults in contemporary Europe? How central is ethnic background to their prospects and lives? This book provides a comparative analysis of the situation of over 2500 children of international migrants in Europe. Focussing on Britain, France and Germany, it examines nine ethnic/nationality groups including Pakistanis and Indians in Britain, Magrebians in France and Turks in Germany. The book includes new empirical material on language use, educational experiences, labour market entry, political incorporation and cultural behaviour of young adults in these three countries based upon a unique comparative international survey. Roger Penn and Paul Lambert offer an antidote to the hysteria surrounding international migrants that has become increasingly evident in the media since 2001. Their findings indicate that there is a widespread process of assimilation underway in each of the three countries, alongside the maintenance of cultural and religious identities associated with parents' country of birth.

Evidence-based practices in providing culturally competent nursing care for ethnic minority patients in years 2000-2009: a literature review
The well-being and productivity of immigrant youth has become one of the most important global issues of our times as a result of mass migration and resettlement. In this volume, scholars from multiple nations and disciplines provide a state-of-the-art overview of contemporary research on immigrant youth and delineate the most promising future directions for research on their success, suggesting implications for policy and interventions that will benefit host societies as well as immigrant youth. The contributors to Realizing the Potential of Immigrant Youth include many of the leading international experts on migration, acculturation, intergroup issues and immigrant youth development, with contributions from the fields of child development, demography, economics, education, immigrant mental health, social psychology and sociology.
