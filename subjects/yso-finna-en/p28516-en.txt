Spatial language and dialogue
Scale in spatial information and analysis
Written by a prominent statistician and author, the first edition of this bestseller broke new ground in the then emerging subject of spatial statistics with its coverage of spatial point patterns. Retaining all the material from the second edition and adding substantial new material, Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns, Third Edition presents models and statistical methods for analyzing spatially referenced point process data. Reflected in the title, this third edition now covers spatio-temporal point patterns. It explores the methodological developments from the last decade along with diverse applications that use spatio-temporally indexed data. Practical examples illustrate how the methods are applied to analyze spatial data in the life sciences. This edition also incorporates the use of R through several packages dedicated to the analysis of spatial point process data. Sample R code and data sets are available on the author's website --

Fundamentals of satellite remote sensing : an environmental approach
From multidimensional and multi-scale data integration to uncertainties in spatial data mining, this book launches into areas that are rarely addressed. Topics covered include: -- New developments of uncertainty modelling, quality control of spatial data, and related research issues in spatial analysis -- Spatial statistical solutions in spatial data quality -- Eliminating systematic error in the analytical results of GIS applications -- A data quality perspective for GIS function workflow design -- Data quality in multi-dimensional integration -- Research challenges on data quality in the integration and analysis of data from multiple sources -- A new approach for imprecision management in the qualitative data warehouse -- A multi-dimensional quality assessment of photogrammetric and LiDAR datasets based on a vector approach -- An analysis on the uncertainty of multi-scale representation for street-block settlement.

New insights into the uncertainty of spatial models in physical geography
This is a book about how ecologists can integrate remote sensing and GIS in their daily work. It will allow ecologists to get started with the application of remote sensing and to understand its potential and limitations. Using practical examples, the book covers all necessary steps from planning field campaigns to deriving ecologically relevant information through remote sensing and modelling of species distributions. All practical examples in this book rely on OpenSource software and freely available data sets. Quantum GIS (QGIS) is introduced for basic GIS data handling, and in-depth spatial analytics and statistics are conducted with the software package R. Readers will learn how to apply remote sensing within ecological research projects, how to approach spatial data sampling and how to interpret remote sensing derived products. The authors discuss a wide range of statistical analyses with regard to satellite data as well as specialised topics such as time-series analysis. Extended scripts on how to create professional looking maps and graphics are also provided. This book is a valuable resource for students and scientists in the fields of conservation and ecology interested in learning how to get started in applying remote sensing in ecological research and conservation planning.
