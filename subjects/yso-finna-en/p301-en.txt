"High-value talent management must be relevant to today's workplace Misplaced Talent takes a hard look at the cluttered field of Talent Management, and offers a clear guide to making better people decisions in any organization. Deliberately challenging practitioners to do more, this insightful discussion sorts through the tools and techniques developed over the last century to examine their true relevance to the modern workplace. You'll learn which activities show the greatest potential to improve the lives of employees and the organizations they work for, and identify which of your existing practices don't really add enough value to be worth the expenditure of time, money, and potentially lost talent. The author asks you to make up your own mind about which approaches work best for your own specific talent decisions, but provides the best theory and practice available today as a foundation upon which to formulate a more relevant strategy. In a world of big data, the potential to understand employees and react appropriately has never been greater. So why is Talent Management as an industry relying on outdated theory and practices? This book is a guide to bringing HR up to date, giving you the tools, techniques, and perspective you need to demonstrate more value to your organization. Adopt the tools and techniques most effective in today's workplace Identify and discard methods that don't add value to the organization Implement critical changes that can transform the HR function Make better people decisions based on psychology and research Fundamentally, not much has changed in what constitutes good people practice. Practitioners must demonstrate the value of Talent Management, but the solutions implemented often fall short of the rigor and discipline they deserve. Misplaced Talent provides the insight you need to refocus attention and engage your organization about the value of better people decisions"--

Few companies have the luxury of operating only in the domestic market nowadays. Therefore, expatriates are sent abroad to ensure that the business operates efficiently.  The objective of this research based thesis was to define and develop the expatriate process of ABB Drives Finland. The aim was to clarify each stage in a logical, written form as a process description, to map the possible pitfalls and to give recommendations based on them. Thus, the goal was to create standards for an optimal expatriate process for ABB Drives Finland. The theoretical framework of this thesis consists of several different topics related to the empirical part. These topics include theories of international human resource management as well as information linked to expatriate processes and globalization. The writer's aim was to create a solid theoretical framework of reference to support the empirical research. To better understand the current situation, a qualitative case study was carried out with a quantitative questionnaire as a basis for discussions. After interviewing the Global Mobility Manager responsible for the expatriate process, two focus group sessions were held. The focus groups consisted of 13 former expatriates. In addition, four former expatriates were interviewed separately. The findings were combined, analyzed and divided into subgroups according to the expatriate stages. As a result, the current expatriate process was defined and several development recommendations were formulated. A process description of an optimal expatriate process for ABB Drives Finland was completed with a mathematical formula that concretely demonstrates the direct savings the company would receive if the process was be optimal. The results will hopefully facilitate Human Resources and Global Mobility teams' constant struggle for extra resources. The improved process will ultimately increase wellbeing and productivity, creating both economic and psychological benefits.
