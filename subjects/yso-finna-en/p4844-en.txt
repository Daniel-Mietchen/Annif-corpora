The charming true story of an inquisitive little boy who decided to write every country in the world. Two years ago, seven-year-old Toby decided he'd like to write to someone in every country, to find out more about the world we live in. With his Mum's encouragement, he set about hand-writing to research scientists in Antarctica, game-keepers in Chad and to a very famous South African president... Nearly everyone he wrote to responded, sometimes sending photos, recipes or drawings, telling Toby a little about where they lived -- how they lived, what food they ate, what school was like, and, importantly for Toby (as someone very interested in dinosaurs), whether there were fossils. This book is the result, bringing together the huge variety of replies that Toby received. Charming, touching and fascinating, this is a book that shows that the world is only as big as your imagination and that it is full of potential friends, waiting to be discovered, no matter where you live.

Martha Gellhorn's heroic career as a reporter brought her to the front lines of virtually every significant international conflict between the Spanish Civil War and the end of the Cold War. While Gellhorn's wartime dispatches rank among the best of the century, her personal letters are their equal: as vivid and fascinating as anything she ever published. Gellhorn's correspondence from 1930 to 1996—chronicling friendships with figures as diverse as Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and H. G. Wells, as well as her tempestuous marriage to Ernest Hemingway—paint a vivid picture of the twentieth century as she lived it. Caroline Moorehead, who was granted exclusive access to the letters, has expertly edited this fascinating volume, providing prefatory and interstitial material that contextualizes Gellhorn's correspondence within the arc of her entire life. The letters introduce us to the woman behind the correspondent—a writer of wit, charm, and vulnerability. The result is an exhilarating, intimate portrait of one of the most accomplished women of modern times.

Message in a bottle
Elizabeth I's linguistic skills were never in doubt during her lifetime. They were put to excellent use when she became queen, and although she never left England, throughout her reign she wrote extensively to correspondents abroad. Her extant foreign correspondence ranges from the ceremonial to the religiously committed to the intimate and emotionally vulnerable. The relationships Elizabeth forged through these texts were of central importance to the diplomacy and politics of the period. This volume presents work on the Queen's correspondence by an international team of scholars and includes newly edited texts and translations of nine of Elizabeth's holograph letters.

Kingdom of fear : loathsome secrets of a star-crossed child in the final days of the American century
Despite needing a heart transplant and against the advice of her doctor, Mary Catherine moves to Uganda to work at a new orphanage. Whatever time she has left, Mary Catherine wants to spend it helping children -- especially since there will be no children of her own. The only problem is Major League Baseball player Marcus Dillinger, the man she never meant to fall in love with. Neither Marcus nor Mary Catherine's other friends -- Tyler Ames and Sami Dawson -- know just how serious her heart condition is. Still, Marcus is sure in the depths of his soul that something isn't right. Ultimately his correspondence with Mary Catherine leads him on a desperate life-or-death mission to rescue her and get her to a United States hospital before time runs out. Meanwhile, Sami and Tyler struggle with issues of their own. In a season when Tyler plans to ask Sami to marry him, the very core of their relationship is in jeopardy
