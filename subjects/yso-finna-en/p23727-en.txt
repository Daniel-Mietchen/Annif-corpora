Heartbreaker
It isn't easy to be a loving partner to someone who is routinely distracted, has trouble restraining their impulses, and finds it difficult to communicate with others. But for those who have partners living with attention deficit disorder, or ADD, these issues are everyday struggles. Often, ADD symptoms manifest in ways that are destructive to healthy relationships. In Loving Someone with Attention Deficit Disorder, marriage and family therapist Susan Tschudi (whose husband has ADD) presents practical guidance readers can use to set healthy boundaries, clarify their expectations, and ensure their partners fulfill their responsibilities. The book focuses on helping the reader meet his or her own needs in the relationship, not just on addressing the needs of their partners. It offers thorough and practical advice for moving through obstacles as a couple, accepting that ADD will always be a part of the relationship, and defusing anger and frustration that may arise.

In "Emotion-Focused Couples Therapy: The Dynamics of Emotion, Love, and Power", authors Leslie S. Greenberg and Rhonda N. Goldman explore the foundations of emotionally focused therapy for couples. They expand its framework to focus more intently on the development of the self and the relationship system through the promotion of self-soothing and other-soothing; to deal with unmet needs both from the client's adulthood and childhood; and to work more explicitly with emotions, specifically fear, anxiety, shame, power, joy, and love. The authors discuss the affect regulation involved in three major motivational systems central to couples therapy - attachment, identity, and attraction and clarify emotions and motivations in the dominance dimension of couples' interactions.Written with practitioners and graduate students in mind, the authors use a rich variety of case material to demonstrate how working with emotions can facilitate change in couples and, by extension, in all situations where people may be in emotional conflict with others. Greenberg and Goldman provide the tools needed to identify specific emotions and show the reader how to work with them to resolve conflict and promote bonding in couples therapy.

"This popular text now includes exercises that can be used by trainers and trainees to foster family therapy skills development. Family Therapy: Concepts, Process and practice is a must-have resource for all students and mental health professionals training in family therapy.
