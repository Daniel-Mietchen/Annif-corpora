Clara Bog and Esker Trail : an introduction for visitors
This study deals with the sand ridges that occur in the area of the Virttaankangas-Säkylänharju esker, which is situated in southwestern Finland. Light is shed on the genesis of the ridges, the factors contributing to their formation, by means of the morphology, stratigraphy and constituent material of these features. The determination of the time of their origin is based on raised-shore investigations. The study is based on field work designed to check the reliability of interpretations made from aerial photographs and maps. Glückert (1971) interpreted the ridges to transverse dunes originated on shores. According to present study they are beach ridges. In some places there are heaps of eolian sand on their summits and over to their lee sides. Few actual dunes have formed.
