Installation art : a critical history / Claire Bishop
This monograph is the first extensive survey of the most important works by Czech-born Canadian artist Vera Frenkel. Her contemplative, transdisciplinary projects have been a presence on the international scene since the 1970s. Her installations, videos, writings, and websites address central issues in an age that is more affected by human migration, and violence than any other. Among her topics are politics of the archive, the impact of media on the shaping of cultural memory and forgetting, and the interplay of institutional and individual narratives. Among the works featured are String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, No Solution: A Suspense Thriller; The Secret Life of Cornelia Lumsden (1979/1986); and from the Transit Bar, (first seen at documenta IX 1992), Body Missing, (1994), and recent works such as ONCE NEAR WATER (2008-09) and The Blue Train (work in progress, 2012). --

Intersecting travelogues : wandering through practices and archaeologies of space, place and image
For nearly three decades Tadashi Kawamata's organic, improvised installations – known as 'displacements' – have been transforming environments, utilising their site histories and found objects. Kawamata is fascinated by coal mines, as symbols of industrial power and working class community, and as neglected sites after closure. Kawamata spent 10 years visiting Japanese and international mining towns, inviting locals to gather materials for sculptural constructions, and reuniting forgotten communities with on-site sport, music, cooking and social events. Accompanying an exhibition at Tokyo's Meguro Museum of Art, this limited edition catalogue commemorates the project with photography, recollection, and Kawamata's own lectures and mission statements.
