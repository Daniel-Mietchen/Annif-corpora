"As today's preeminent doomsday investor Mark Spitznagel describes his Daoist and roundabout investment approach, "one gains by losing and loses by gaining." This is Austrian Investing, an archetypal, counterintuitive, and proven approach, gleaned from the 150-year-old Austrian School of economics, that is both timeless and exceedingly timely. In The Dao of capital, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel--with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career--takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring. Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and--as Spitznagel has shown--highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel "brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio. "The Dao of capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process--a harmony that is so essential today"--

BIRI provides expert consulting in broking, finding suitable investment targets, finding contacts, development of the real estate, organizing finance with both banks and other investors etc. At the moment BIRI is looking at the possibility of expanding its services in Europe to cover certain parts of Germany mainly the northwestern parts. As per the company's request Hamburg was chosen as the city the following study is concentrated on. Hamburg is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in Germany and it has seen steady growth for some time. As BIRI and the signee are already well acquainted with the Finnish real estate market it was decided to compare the two markets and their legal procedures in order to get an understanding of the potential as well as positive and negative aspects of the German market compared to the Finnish one. The work was roughly divided into ten parts starting with a market analysis of Hamburg and ending on the topic of investing through a limited company. The goal is to give a general comprehensive view on the requirements and steps needed to be taken before and after buying real estate in Germany. The project is based on books about business premises investing, various internet resources about the topic and interviews with experts in the field as well as personal experience from the writer. While going through the phases of international real estate investment from Finland to Germany, both residential and business premises were used to bring out the most relevant facts, also residential and business premises were compared as investment targets. The results indicate that investing in Germany has a lot of potential.

Privatization in recent years has become a common phenomenon leading to the formation of privatization agencies in almost all countries across Africa.  In this study, the main objective is to provide an understanding as to why privatization is key in attracting foreign direct investments . Also; it looked at the motivation for and the impact of such investments in an organisation. This study also attempted to look into the origin and current status of privatization in Africa and some of the notable economic benefits it has accrued  necessary to support the study of this subject by use of  literature reviews. The  data collected in this research study  supports the fact that privatization is essential in attracting FDI. Qualitative method was used to collect data for the analysis. Thirteen management officials from a privatized company were interviewed. Some secondary data (statistics/ figures) about FDI were collected through email from the Kenya Investment Agency (KIA).The empirical findings are presented and analysed by use of narration deduced from stories told by interviewees. The findings indicate that the current wave of privatization (from the 2000's to date, especially in telecommunication) has led to a tremendous  increase in FDI . The study also shows that when privatization is strategically implemented, it boosts the overall economic efficiency in a company as well as mobilizing more foreign and domestic investments.

Insurance companies promote economic activity by offering savings products and protection against risks. At the same time, insurance companies themselves are also investors. The reliability of insurance business is important for the economy as a whole. The low level of interest rates weakens insurance companies' investment returns and increases the market value of liabilities in the sector; when protracted, this poses problems, particularly for life insurers. Systemic risks in the insurance business have begun to attract attention, especially in consideration of insurance companies' importance as significant institutional investors..

This new volume in the series will follow the same effective formula used by its predecessors. The book will devote a chapter to each of a broad array of highly successful traders, ranging widely in the markets they trade and their methodologies, but sharing in their achievement of superior performance. Each chapter, following the original format, will include an introductory section, a core section based on an interview with the trader, and a conclusion section that seeks to draw useful trading and investment lessons illustrated by the trader's approach and advice"--
