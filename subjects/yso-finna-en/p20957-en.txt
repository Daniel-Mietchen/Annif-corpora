Building upon his earlier book Effective Multi-Unit Leadership (described by the Leadership and Organization Journal as one of the key books of its kind for this decade ) Professor Chris Edger has produced a book that clearly defines and outlines the professional practice of outstanding retail Area Managers. Bursting with real-life Case Studies this book will be essential reading for General Managers who aim to go further up the chain of command and Area Managers who want to be the best! Professor Edger outlines how Area Managers can close down the distance between themselves and their units in order to optimise performance. Without abandoning academic rigor he produces essential how to checklists for the ambitious GM or Area Manager that can be applied out in the field. This book is a must read for those that aspire to become great retail Area Managers.
