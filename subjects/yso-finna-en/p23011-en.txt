Enterprise resource planning is going to the cloud and to stay ahead of the competition, SAP has presented a new solution for companies' finance departments to run their daily business. SAP Simple Finance, the first step of the SAP'S/4HANA roadmap, provides a re-designed data model, a simple user interface and real-time business for companies to help them stay innovative. This thesis studies the new functions that Simple Finance brings to SAP Accounting and investigates, from companies' perspective, how the achieved benefits will affect the way of managing business. In addition to that, the thesis presents SAP's fairly new HANA database as well as discusses the company's strategy with its cloud solutions now and in the near future. Having introduced the three cornerstones of the solution for accounting, cash management and business planning in detail, the thesis discusses why it was necessary to change the user interface and what the solution SAP has come up with is. To provide information on the implementation, the thesis presents the migration steps as well as the roadmap that companies could have when starting the road to SAP HANA. This thesis stands behind SAP's strategy of moving forward but when it comes to Simple Finance, the need for optimized financial solution does not justify the implementation; there has to be a higher level need, and a business case for HANA database.
