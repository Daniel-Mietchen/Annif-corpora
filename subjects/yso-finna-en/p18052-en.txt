This work represents a comprehensive account of all existing methods of statistical estimation for Boolean models. It summarizes the available theory concerning Boolean models in a form accessible for mathematically aware scientists working in stochastic geometry, image analysis and microscopy. Written in lecture note style, it has two levels of presentation - one orientated to applied mathematicians and the other for general mathematicians.
