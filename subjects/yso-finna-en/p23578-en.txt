Heat stress and chilling sensitivity of different ripening classes of tomatoes
Introduction to food process engineering
Responses of heat stress to prevent chilling injury of tomatoes
Interaction of prechilling, temperature, osmotic stress, and light in Picea abies seed germination
Managing the cold chain for quality and safety
Thermal, circulatory, and neuromuscular responses to whole-body cryotherapy
Germination differences between natural and afforested populations of Pinus brutia and Cupressus sempervirens
A simple solution to volume constraints
Production of calves following nonsurgical transfer of fresh and refrigerated bovine demi-embryos
Summary: A histological study of chilled and nonchilled seeds of Rubus chamaemorus L. has shown considerable loss of storage granules in the latter case. Chilling helps to maintain viability.
