"New Technologies in Developing Societies examines critically, and from theoretical, practical and policy perspectives how new technologies are transforming day-to-day human activities in Africa and other developing regions. In particular it addresses how technologies are harnessed to enhance socioeconomic conditions, and how people use technologies to empower themselves and to foster a strong deliberative democracy. It also studies how they deal with the challenges that new technologies pose to the protection of intellectual property rights of indigenous people, and the struggles between tradition and modernity in the HIV/AIDS prevention campaign.

"Based on an in-depth examination of Mexico's print and broadcast media over the last twenty-five years, this book is the most richly detailed account available of the role of the media in democratization, demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between changes in the press and changes in the political system. In addition to illuminating the nature of political change in Mexico, this accessibly written study also has broad implications for understanding the role of the mass media in democratization around the world." --Publisher's description.

Television in transition : papers from the First international television studies conference
Broadcasting is arguably the most influential and powerful industry operating today. The media impose an inescapable presence in contemporary life and infuse all areas of public communication. But what is the quality of the relationship between 'broadcaster' and 'citizen'? Do the media and media authorities take the audience's interests seriously into account? Do audiences have real opportunities to express themselves? Are citizens well informed and educated about the social, the cultural and the civic role that media can play? In this book, five authors present the main results of an extensive programme of research that was financed by the European Commission. The study was conducted in 29 European countries and each author analyses European trends from different but complementary perspectives: from the broadcasters' side (media accountability and responsibility, including the key role of Public Service Broadcasting); from the citizens' side (viewers' participation mechanisms) and from the regulatory side (legal instruments which protect viewer rights). Given the historical experience of the United Kingdom, the situation in this country is analysed in detail. A specific chapter also describes the instruments and procedures that TV viewers have at the European Union level in addition to those existing at national level.
