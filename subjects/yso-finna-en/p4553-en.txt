basicity
The first part of this book looks at the consequence of chemical and topological defects existing on real surfaces, which explain the wettability of super hydrophilc and super hydrophobic surfaces. There follows an in-depth analysis of the acido-basicity of surfaces with, as an illustration, different wettability experiments on real materials.
