Head first design patterns
A student-friendly, course-friendly guide to compiler theory, applications, and programming technologyCompiler construction is a tricky subject, involving theory, the application of that theory, and programming technology. Virtually every day, advances in computer technology propel advances in compiler technology. Compiler Construction Using Java, JavaCC, and Yacc covers every topic essential to learning compilers from the ground up and is accompanied by a powerful and flexible software package for evaluating projects as well as several tutorials, well-defined projects, and test cases. While the coverage of JavaCC is entirely optional, this book provides the only comprehensive introduction to the topic currentlyavailable.Far easier to read and understand than any other compiler guide, this booksets a new standard for learning this invaluable skill. It provides:. Strong coverage of formal languages, including context-sensitive and unrestricted languages as well as regular and context-free languages. A clear exposition of compiler design and implementation theory . Numerous well-defined projects, using source language with six levels of complexity. A complete teaching support software package that evaluates compiler projects for correctness, run time, and size of code, and runs on multiple platforms. Immediate feedback for students on their projectsCompiler Construction Using JavaTM, JavaCC, and Yacc provides substantial support for each project, many of which are incremental enhancements of previous projects. The goals at each new level are challenging but achievable and can be reached in several different ways, for example, by writing a compiler or interpreter by hand, with JavaCC, or with Yacc.

Covers fundamental and advanced Java database programming techniques for beginning and experienced readersThis book covers the practical considerations and applications in database programming using Java NetBeans IDE, JavaServer Pages, JavaServer Faces, and Java Beans, and comes complete with authentic examples and detailed explanations.Two data-action methods are developed and presented in this important resource. With Java Persistence API and plug-in Tools, readers are directed step by step through the entire database programming development process and will be able to design and build professional data-action projects with a few lines of code in mere minutes. The second method, runtime object, allows readers to design and build more sophisticated and practical Java database applications.Advanced and updated Java database programming techniques such as Java Enterprise Edition development kits, Enterprise Java Beans, JavaServer Pages, JavaServer Faces, Java RowSet Object, and Java Updatable ResultSet are also discussed and implemented with numerous example projects.Ideal for classroom and professional training use, this text also features:. A detailed introduction to NetBeans Integrated Development Environment. Java web-based database programming techniques (web applications and web services). More than thirty detailed, real-life sample projects analyzed via line-by-line illustrations. Problems and solutions for each chapter. A wealth of supplemental material available for download from the book's ftp site, including PowerPoint slides, solution manual, JSP pages, sample image files, and sample databases. Coverage of two popular database systems: SQL Server 2008 and OracleThis book provides undergraduate and graduate students as well as database programmers and software engineers with the necessary tools to handle the database programming issues in the Java NetBeans environment.
