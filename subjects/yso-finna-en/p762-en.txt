Presentation of the fundamental principles and practices of modern digital design. Transistor-level implementations are included, which allow the readers to gain a solid understanding of a circuit's real potential and limitations, and to develop a realistic perspective on the practical design of actual integrated circuits. Coverage includes the largest selection available of digital circuits in all categories (combinational, sequential, logical, or arithmetic). Coverage also includes detailed digital design techniques, with a thorough discussion on state-machine modeling for the analysis and design of complex sequential systems. Key technologies used in modern circuits are also described, including Bipolar, MOS, ROM/RAM, and CPLD/FPGA chips, as well as codes and techniques used in data storage and transmission.--from publisher description.

"Ones and Zeros explains, in lay terms, Boolean algebra, the suprisingly simple system of mathematical logic used in digital computer circuitry. Ones and Zeros follows the development of this logic system from its origins in Victorian England to its rediscovery in this century as the foundation of all modern computing machinery. Readers will learn about the interesting history of the development of symbolic logic in particular, and the often misunderstood process of mathematical invention and scientific discovery, in general. Ones and Zeros also features practical exercises with answers, real-world examples of digital circuit design, and a reading list." "Ones and Zeros will be of particular interest to software engineers who want to gain a comprehensive understanding of computer hardware." "Outstanding features include: a history of mathematical logic, an explanation of the logic of digital circuits, and hands-on exercises and examples."--BOOK JACKET.

This work represents a comprehensive account of all existing methods of statistical estimation for Boolean models. It summarizes the available theory concerning Boolean models in a form accessible for mathematically aware scientists working in stochastic geometry, image analysis and microscopy. Written in lecture note style, it has two levels of presentation - one orientated to applied mathematicians and the other for general mathematicians.
