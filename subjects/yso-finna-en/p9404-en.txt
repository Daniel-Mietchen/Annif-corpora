The used time from the order creation to the actual delivery date is determined based on the data collected from the SAP program. All information was collected from the SAP database using limited group of products. The information is divided into smaller groups based on the delivery address and the delivery priority set by the customer. The company that commissioned the study is one of the world's leading marine and energy power solutions provider. The supply of spare parts is a significant part of the company's services division. By monitoring the customer service, the business can be developed t be more customer-oriented and a long-term customer relationship can be ensured. The theoretical sec tion presents the values set by the customer and internal order processing, which affects the time duration of the order process of spare parts. The focus of the study was on delivery form and urgency that the customer has defined when placing the order, and on how the company has classified the spare part deliveries internally and how it works in practice.
