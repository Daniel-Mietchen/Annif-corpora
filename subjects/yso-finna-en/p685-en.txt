Classical studies : a guide to the reference literature
The volume, which constitutes a tribute to the scholarly work of Jean Lallot, contains contributions on the history of syntax in Antiquity (including the later Byzantine period). The various papers highlight the problematic status of syntactic description in ancient grammar. The contributions are grouped into four sections, the first of which deals with the status of syntactic description and reflection in Antiquity, the second with Alexandrian grammar, the third with the "virtues and vices of speech", whereas the fourth section contains papers on the relationship between syntax and dialectic, between syntax and phonetics, and between syntax and lexicology. The contributors are international specialists (from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Greece, and the United States) in the field of ancient grammaticography.

The present book was born of an international research project on 'Classics and Communism' which aimed to discover and explore the history of classical philology after World War II in what was then considered the camp of Socialist countries....The work involved a number of 'case studies', such as personal histories of prominent philologists in the region, as well as national surveys. Classical studies were explored in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, particularly in Russia, Lithuania, and Ukraine; the situation in Yugoslavia was examined on the example of Serbia and Slovenia.

Strategies in teaching greek and latin : two decades of experimentation
Over the last decades, the study of the history of ancient linguistics has enjoyed an increasing popularity. This book concentrates on two aspects of ancient grammar: the predominance of a semantic approach and the importance of the cultural and intellectual context of grammatical theories. In a series of casestudies on the Stoa, Apollonius Dyscolus, the so-called causal use of ίνα, and the interjections, the author demonstrates the relationships between the various disciplines studying language.

The Origins of Criticism complements the usual, history-of-ideas approach to the topic precisely by treating criticism as a social as well as a theoretical activity. With unprecedented and penetrating detail, Ford considers varying scholarly interpretations of the key texts discussed. Examining Greek discussions of poetry from the late sixth century B.C. through the rise of poetics in the late fourth, he asks when we first can recognize anything like the modern notions of literature as imaginative writing and of literary criticism as a special knowledge of such writing.
