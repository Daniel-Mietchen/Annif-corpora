"Eve Arnold's interest in photography started late with a photo-finishing job in New York City in 1946. A member of Magnum Photos, her list of assignments were a mix of politics, social issues, travel, and current events, with a little glamour thrown in. Arnold is perhaps best known for her images of Marilyn Monroe. She has chronicled figures as diverse as migrant potato workers, heads of state, and screen icons. A blend of exacting technique and moral courage would typify her long career which never settled for clich es or stereotypes. Guided in her own words, this volume features Arnold's iconic photographs as well as many never-before published images."

An introduction to press photography
"The Path to Buddha looks at the daily life of Buddhists and their pilgrimages to holy sites. In the two main chapters of the book, we see the monks in animated discussion, meditation and prayer, and follow the devout believers on their arduous journeys to prayer. These two chapters are interspersed with sections of portraits of this proud and dignified people who have their own innate sense of style and fashion demonstrated in the way they dress and adorn themselves."

This book records the full reach of the FSA program from 1935 to 1943, honoring its vigor and commitment across subjects, states, and stylistic preferences. The photographs are arranged into four broad regional sections but otherwise allowed to speak for themselves-to provide individual impressions as much as they cumulatively build an indelible survey of a nation. Through color and black-and-white images, we meet convicts, cotton workers, kids on the street, and relocated workers on the road. We see subjects victim to the elements of nature and the timeless rituals of human life, as much as to the vagaries of the global economic market. We meet Dorothea Lange's iconic Migrant Mother, weather-beaten and worn, with two children leaning on her shoulders.

William Klein is a cult figure in photography and film and, although long noted as a painter, his early work has remained largely unseen for over sixty years. This book presents a selection of extremely rare Klein paintings from the late 1940s and early 1950s. It also includes projects for murals, some of which executed on a monumental scale for the first time, Lettrist works, fashion photographs and Printed Contacts. The show also maps a decisive moment in the artist's development: in 1952. While photographing his painted Turning Panels commissioned by architect Angelo Mangiarotti, Klein captured the blur of objects in movement. The incident set the artist off on a series of experiments in the dark room, in which he developed the blueprint of his photographic abstraction. Giving a new perspective on his entire career, this book clearly portrays the foundations of Klein's unique visual language as his trajectory is traced through painting, architecture, photography, books, and film.
