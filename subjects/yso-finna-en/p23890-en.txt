Cardiorespiratory function is prominently affected by oxidative stress. Cigarette smoking is the archetype of oxidative and nitrative stress and free radical formation. New adverse effects of smoking keep on propping up in research. The chapters provide the comprehensive view of new developments in this area regarding cardiovascular and lung function and muscle catabolism. Alterations in inflammatory cytokines and proteins as well as degradation of muscle proteins due to smoking, by far unrecognized, caused by oxidative stress also are presented. Much less is known about the effect of cognitive stress on vagally-mediated cardiorespiratory function and surprisingly, on vagal immune pathway. The experimental studies also show that clinically important meconium aspiration syndrome contains an oxidative trait which is amenable to antioxidative treatment. This volume creates a source of information on the damaging role of oxidative stress in cardiorespiratory function that has by far not been available.

Why the Pain? What's the Gain? takes you on a guided tour of humankind's 3000-year wayward search for the perfect workout; from the dirt courtyards of the ancient Greek gymnasium to the birth of the modern gym in 19th-century Paris; to the weekend, beachside Olympic-caliber gymnasts of Santa Monica and Sydney. Daniel Kunitz seeks the answer to a simple yet profound question: Why do we work out? We will listen in on the innovators and charlatans who lifted the multibillion-dollar business of gym-fitness into being. We will learn how the women's movement sparked an enormous exercise boom and tell the story not only of how we arrived at the big-box gym era but also of the last decade's acceleration into a new fitness frontier. Daniel Kunitz puts himself through the grit and pain of the cross fit, parkour and tough mudder regimes, searching not just for new-found physique, but on a quest to understand the pain and more precisely the gain of working out.

"In this fifth edition of Principles of Exercise Testing and Interpretation, as in earlier editions, we attempt to develop conceptual advances in the physiology and pathophysiology of exercise, particularly as related to the practice of medicine. The underlying theme of the book continues to be the recognition that the most important requirement for exercise performance is transport of oxygen to support the bioenergetic processes in the muscle cells (including, of course, the heart) and elimination of the carbon dioxide formed as a byproduct of exercise metabolism. Thus, appropriate cardiovascular and ven- tilatory responses are required to match those of muscle respiration in meeting the energy demands of exercise. As depicted by the logo on the book cover, normal exercise performance requires an efficient coupling of external to internal (cellular) respiration. Appropriate treatment of exercise intolerance requires that patients' symptoms be thought of in terms of a gas exchange defect between the cell and the environment. The defect may be in the lungs, heart, peripheral or pulmonary circulations, the muscles themselves, or there may be a combination of defects. Thus, we describe the pathophysiology in gas transport and exchange that affect any site in the cardio- respiratory coupling between the lungs and the muscles. We illustrate how cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide the means for a critical evaluation by the clinician-scientist of the functional competency of each component in the coupling of cellular to external respiration, including the cardiovascular system. To achieve this, clinical cases are used to illustrate the wide spectrum of pathophysiology capable of causing exercise intolerance"--Provided by publisher.

"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)

This unique and comprehensive handbook examines the various models of stress, coping, and health and their relevance for nursing and related health fields. Building on the first edition that has been highly-praised for its analysis and critique of existing models and its discussion of new research surrounding self-regulation and stress, this Second Edition continues to provide a critical analysis of the field while providing up to date cutting-edge research. Under the expert editorship of Dr. Virginia Hill Rice, experienced scholars and practitioners present a broad range of issues and research that relate to stress and health, such as response-oriented stress; stimulus-oriented stress; and transactional stress, coping, and health in children, adolescents, attitudes, and much, much more.
