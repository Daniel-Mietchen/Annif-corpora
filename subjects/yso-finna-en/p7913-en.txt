The "Counseling Skills Practice Manual" is a practical guide for students who are working on improving their counseling skills. Designed as a companion to "The Essential Counselor" and its accompanying DVD of professionally demonstrated skills, this manual works directly with the student, offering a discussion of each skill set along with examples and practice exercises. The manual features 12 practice sessions, each of which focuses on a specific counseling skill set. Many of the essential skills are covered, such as using questions, non-verbal behaviors, making reflections of client meaning, and feeling. But the student also gains practice here with other important skills, such as learning how to deal with clients in crisis and reluctant clients, how to appropriately confront, and how to give and receive accurate and supportive feedback to one another. These practice sessions are designed to help the students recognize and build upon their natural interpersonal skill set as they learn new skills. They will help students become more competent in their use of counseling skills and feel more comfortable and confident in their roles as emerging counseling professionals.

Promoting child development and mental health in adult psychiatric care : a nurses' perspective
The Welfare of Children with Mentally Ill Parents examines the interventions made by professional workers from a range of different disciplines in families with dependent children and a mentally ill parent. The authors compare responses of professionals in ten European countries and one state in Australia. The analysis of the differences sheds new light on both the inherent and system-determined difficulties in helping families to manage their situation effectively. Features the only comparative study of mental health social services and the law governing compulsory hospital admission Covers a current "hot-button" topic that is growing in importance as the impact of social policy developments on children over time becomes more apparent Offers a unique perspective due to the focus on the impact of children of mentally ill parents and the international systems that deal with child protection.
