In 2009–2011, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the United Kingdom Health Protection Agency undertook a project to investigate the adverse health effects of floods and to understand how best to protect the health of populations during floods in the WHO European Region. The project had two main components. A questionnaire was sent to 50 of the 53 Member States of the WHO European Region to collect information on recent experience of floods, their health effects and current preparedness and response mechanisms. In addition, a systematic review was undertaken of the epidemiological literature on the global impact of flooding on health. Analysis of the returned questionnaires and the peer-reviewed literature brought to light many issues pertinent to Europe. These findings will help WHO to prepare evidence-based guidance for the European Region on health concerns before, during and after flooding incidents and the measures for prevention, response and recovery.

On the other hand, various interactions between microwave devices and their environment, such as feeding structures and housing, must be taken into account, and this is only possible through full-wave EM analysis. Electromagnetic simulations can be highly accurate, but they tend to be computationally expensive. Therefore, practical design optimization methods have to be computationally efficient, so that the number of CPU-intensive high-fidelity EM simulations is reduced as much as possible during the design process. For the same reasons, techniques for creating fast yet accurate models of microwave structures become crucially important. In this edited book, the authors strive to review the state-of-the-art simulation-driven microwave design optimization and modeling. A group of international experts specialized in various aspects of microwave computer-aided design summarize and review a wide range of the latest developments and real-world applications.^

Computer-aided full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis has been used in microwave engineering for the past decade. Initially, its main application area was design verification. Today, EM-simulation-driven optimization and design closure become increasingly important due to the complexity of microwave structures and increasing demands for accuracy. In many situations, theoretical models of microwave structures can only be used to yield the initial designs that need to be further fine-tuned to meet given performance requirements. In addition, EM-based design is a must for a growing number of microwave devices such as ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas, dielectric resonator antennas and substrate-integrated circuits. For circuits like these, no design-ready theoretical models are available, so design improvement can only be obtained through geometry adjustments based on repetitive, time-consuming simulations.^
