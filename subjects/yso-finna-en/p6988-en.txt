This Bachelor  ́s thesis set out to compose a marketing communications plan that can be adapted into actual use by Company XYZ. The emphasis of the research was put on studying the success of the company  ́s  existing marketing communications tools as well as the existing customers ́ and partners ́ reception of the suggested additions. These additions were created through research of relevant academic literature and the input of the company representatives. The choice of promotional tools was also restricted to an extent by financial boundaries set by XYZ. The theoretical framework was formed by combining Fill  ́s marketing communications planning framework with the collective input of marketing communications theories from Pelsmacker, Geuens and Van den Bergh and Vuokko. Following the theoretical analysis and the construction of a preliminary marketing communications plan, a quantitative survey was carried out with a total of 45 respondents, each an existing customer of XYZ or in another way already affiliated with the company. The survey - conducted electronically -concentrated on mapping the opinions of the respondents regarding XYZ  ́s current marketing communications. The survey also presented the respondents with the suggested new promotional tools in order to gain feedback on which ones are noteworthy enough to include in the revised marketing communications plan and which ones to eliminate entirely. The distribution of the survey endured for 20 days, after which results were gathered, presented and analyzed. Based on the analysis, a revised marketing communications model was created and conclusions for the company were made. Generally XYZ  ́s existing promotional tools work well, with the company  ́s website and personal referrals raising as the two most important and functional tools. The company is also promoted well via trade shows and car dealerships and printed material such as brochures and magazine articles. The most lucrative additions to the promotional mix were found to be a direct mail campaign, a monthly electronic newsletter and free gifts. Also XYZ  ́s existing blog and Facebook group were regarded as promotional tools that have potential but need to be developed further to work fully. Further research opportunities lie in the company  ́s brand analysis, more effective ways of using social media as a promotional media and an expansion plan for the company once they become large enough to be able to cater to a market larger than Finland.

Abstract: Athletes as endorsers : sports stars playing in the field of advertising. This thesis studies the celebrity endorsement model and specially athletes as endorsers. What drives the companies to use athletes as spokesperson and how do they cope with risks involved in it? As recently news have been filled with scandals involving athletes with multimillion endorsement deals how could have these been avoided and what are the effects on endorsing companies? Main focus of the study is to investigate what kind of methods marketers use to ensure a successful endorsement campaign? Secondary focus was on researching what kind of risks companies face when cooperating with a star athlete? This thesis uses secondary data as its main source of information. Conducted research show that even though use of athletes as endorsers can be very risky, it can also lead to success. In celebrity endorsement only certainty is uncertainty. It was also discovered that marketers often value extremely different attributes when selecting a female endorser than they do with male endorsers.

Integrated communication : concern, internal and marketing communication
Live entertainment is currently one of the few vital components of the music industry as it struggles to survive in the XXI century and conform to the drastic changes on the music market. Music events occur in great amount on a daily basis and it is important to plan and produce them in the right manner in order to stay relevant and secure one's place on the market. This report introduces various crucial matters that require attention during event organization process, such as marketing and strategic planning, communication and promotion, risk management, event programming and capacity management, to name a few. The 5-phase project management model is applied as the base on which this thesis is built. The research is conducted by comparing the theoretical and practical approach used in the music event business. The practical approach is based on examinations and interviews with the world market leader in live entertainment – Live Nation. An additional analysis of practices used in other large and successful music events in Europe and USA is also conducted. As this thesis shows, the practical approach is often easier and less rigorous than the theory. Some of the steps in this process may be simply omitted due to being considered of little relevance by the management team, many other are outsourced to professional agencies depending on requirements (security, catering). It becomes evident how important it is to be innovative and always stay up to date with the state of the market in order to organize the most successful events.
Understanding digital marketing : marketing strategies for engaging the digital generation
Marketing in todays society has gone to a level in which the act of selling is causing resentment among the public. We are at a stage where traditional printed advertising has lost its strength and digital marketing has taken over; raising the stakes. In between all this, most companies have failed to analyze their existing clientele, thus improving their up-to-date knowledge on the target group and aiming the marketing to the proper customer segments. The case company, Liikuntakeskus Voitto Ltd., is a recently founded health and fitness center located in Limingantulli, Oulu. The topic for this thesis originated from the owners of the company; wishing to examine its clientele in order to gain detailed knowledge on the current target group and to readjust the marketing if necessary. The objective was to determine what type of customer groups Liikuntakeskus Voitto is formed of and how they can be reached in terms of marketing communication. This thesis also aimed to uncover the questions on how the customers had initiated first contact with the case company and what were the main reasons to join. Quantitative research method was used in gathering the data for the empirical part of the thesis. The research itself was conducted as a questionnaire; as a traditional paper form and an online survey. Closed questions were used for the most part to gain coherent and comparable answers. However, the questionnaire included also a few open-ended questions allowing the customers to give direct feedback on the services to the client company. The theoretical part of the thesis was based on printed and online material. The results were presented to the management of the client company and the necessary action was taken in accordance with the results. The main customer segments and their characteristics were identified, revealing the potential development area in marketing. ^

The purpose of this thesis is to find out how persuasive and ensuing effectiveness advertising campaigns related to economic crisis in social marketing are. During the case study of the Finnish campaign Älä Ruoki Lamaa (“Don't Feed the Recession”) and the American campaign Feed the Pig, the primary objective is to identify key issues related to persuasive communication. The research takes a closer look at the advertisements and the web pages of the campaigns. Älä Ruoki Lamaa is a national ad campaign which urges people to spend money in order to keep the recession from expanding. The Finnish campaign is quite contrary to the campaign running in the United States, which urges people to do the exact opposite: “Feed the pig”. Both campaigns try to fight the recession, but the core messages of the campaigns are very different, as well as the knowledge and arguments communicated. Älä Ruoki Lamaa wants people to keep their old consumer behavior and Feed the Pig wants people to change their spending habits. These goals of the campaigns coincide with the goal of social marketing, to encourage people to adopt behavior that will enhance their own and fellow citizens' lives. The analysis and interpretation in this thesis concentrates on the visible aspect of the advertising campaigns. Through the results of the research, which deals with the non-traditional topic of recession, an insight into social marketing campaigns is given. During the research process various ways of improving persuasiveness of advertisements are presented and the interdependency and substitutability of different communicational tools are exemplified. The results suggest that the complex interrelations between target audience, media strategy, message structure, message strategy and presentation of the advertisements used in marketing communication all have a great influence on the persuasiveness and effectiveness of advertising campaigns, as well on social marketing communication.

The aim of this thesis was to find the appropriate way for BPW Helsinki to attract young foreign business or professional women living in Finland. To achieve this objective, the key research question has been stated as “How could the business-oriented non-Finnish young women get interested in BPW membership?” Various theories of marketing communication by Kotler & Keller; De Pelsmacker, Geuens & Van den Bergh; McDonald & Wilson; Homburg, Kuester & Krohmer have been used to support the empirical part of this research. Besides, a framework has been established based on the marketing communication planning framework of Fill. Only qualitative method has been applied to accomplish the research. The data included six interviews collected through face-to-face contacts and e-mails. This research identified that foreign women do not know anything about BPW Helsinki. Hence, improving communication with the foreign women is the primary objective to attract the potential women to BPW Helsinki. Besides, BPW Helsinki needs to operate new services like career counseling, parenting and Finnish language training. The research revealed that cultural factors would be a pivotal issue while targeting foreign women to become members.
Nowadays, digital solutions and social online interaction are commonly used for educational purposes. One of the pioneers who offers modern and innovative solutions for e-learning is Finnish company HappyWise Ltd. based in Oulu.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in marketing communication
This thesis researches the potential and usage of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in marketing communication. The commissioning company for this thesis is the German company XiLLeR GmbH, which operates in the fields of IT and the media. XiLLeR GmbH would like to know what is already possible with the help of RFID technology in marketing communication and in which direction this technology is developing. This research started in the summer 2009 by collecting information about the topic from a variety of sources. The project itself began in the fall 2009 and ended on schedule in May 2010. This thesis does not specifically concentrate on researching RFID technology in logistics, and a broader research of RFID technology itself is not included in this research. The information framework is about the basics of RFID technology, and there is a short introduction of Near Field Communication (NFC) software. NFC enables the usage of RFID in mobile phones. A chapter about traditional marketing communication tools interacting with RFID presents, among other things, different cases around the world and what RFID technology could bring to marketing communication. This helps the reader to build a larger picture as to how marketing communication can benefit from this technology. The ethicality of the RFID technology in marketing communication is researched, especially from the consumer's privacy point of view. The research method in this thesis is qualitative. Empirical material consists of personal interviews, articles and cases. The analysis of this material is based more on words and pictures than on numbers. This approach was chosen because the subject is new and the research needed interviews from professionals with a certain level of technological knowledge in order to get optimum results.    RFID has been identified as one of the cornerstones of the upcoming “Internet of Things”, where interconnected networks are everywhere and part of people's everyday life. The shift from mass-markets to more personalized micro-markets give marketers the need to create more personalized targeted marketing, which could be offered with the help of RFID technology. The younger generation can use technology better than any previous one. Their growing needs in the field of technology make it easy to envision future success for RFID technology in marketing communication.
From selling to ease of purchasing : a sales study, case company X Inc
The purpose of this thesis was to create an integrated marketing communications plan. The thesis was made for a Finnish consulting company which is specialized on project-, risk- and quality management in different industries in Finland and abroad. The past advertising has relied on relationships with former cooperation partners and the objective of the study is to define what kind of integrated marketing communications plan the enterprise in question needs when aiming to increase customer awareness and enhance the current corporate identity. Hence, the study focuses on situation analysis and the actual IMC program including the suggested advertising- and promotional tools. In addition, sketched plans were created for a logo, business card and website layout of the company. A qualitative method was chosen for the empirical part of the study. The data was collected by using unstructur ed interviews and various sources of the industrial field in question to ensure the practicability of the final outcome. This thesis had two outcomes. It provides feasible ideas and a theoretical framework about the subject for the case company and offers a draft of new visual corporate identity. However, the final decisions and execution are left for the company as they are dependent of company's preferences and resources.
