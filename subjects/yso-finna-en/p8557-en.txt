Talks to teachers : a festschrift for N. L. Gage
"Anyone who spends time with children knows that praise works. It is a powerful motivator - praising children for good behaviour or good work builds self- esteem and self-confidence. Children love to collect stickers, certificates and rewards - so what better way is there to shape behaviour, encourage good work habits and produce confident learners? Teachers and parents alike know that praise is effective - we use it every day and we see the positive effect that it has on our children. However, constructivist practitioners would argue that praise in any form creates hierarchies and competition in the classroom, has little effect on genuine learning and is invasively judgemental rather than supportive. Constructivists would further argue that self-esteem cannot be built by external agency - teachers and parents can only create an appropriate environment in which a robust sense of 'self' can grow and develop. This book challenges traditional, embedded thinking about the role of praise. It questions the assumptions we make about developing self-esteem, about the ability of children to form their own independent judgements and the choices that children make regardless, rather than because of, contingent praise. What happens when children are praised? Read this book, listen to what children really think and challenge your own assumptions. Features include:- - Case studies and children's work samples; - Points for reflection which could be used for CPD sessions; - Appendices containing behaviour policy samples; - Pupil, teacher and parental perspectives"-- Provided by publisher. - A David Fulton Book.

This book makes techniques widely used in the field of discourse analysis accessible to a broad audience and illustrates their application in the study of classroom talk. Its separate chapters illustrate the analysis of interactional resources such as turn taking, participation frameworks, narrative and contextualization cues, and modeling forms of discourse analysis teachers may practice in their classrooms. Throughout, the author urges readers to use these analytic tools to investigate their own assumptions about what goes on in classrooms, what counts as knowledge, and how features of talk and interaction influence who gets to learn.
Dialect and education : some European perspectives
"Comprehensive Behavior Management: Schoolwide, Classroom, and Individualized Approaches supports teachers in preventing management problems and responding to unwanted behavior when it occurs in classrooms. The text offers a comprehensive presentation of three levels of behavior management strategies: school-wide, classroom, and individual, all three of which contribute to a positive learning environment. A social learning emphasis, in which human behavior is viewed within an ecological framework, is integrated throughout the text. Application of this information is supported by a range of devices such as vignettes, examples, strategies, and activities to show teachers how to manage behavior effectively"--
