Volume III sets out classical Cauchy theory. It is much more geared towards its innumerable applications than towards a more or less complete theory of analytic functions. Cauchy-type curvilinear integrals are then shown to generalize to any number of real variables (differential forms, Stokes-type formulas). The fundamentals of the theory of manifolds are then presented, mainly to provide the reader with a "canonical'' language and with some important theorems (change of variables in integration, differential equations). A final chapter shows how these theorems can be used to construct the compact Riemann surface of an algebraic function, a subject that is rarely addressed in the general literature though it only requires elementary techniques.
"The book gives thorough coverage of the derivation and solution methods for all fundamental nonlinear model equations, such as Korteweg-de Vries, Camassa-Holm, Degasperis-Procesi, Euler-Poincare, Toda lattice, Boussinesq, Burgers, Fisher, Whitham, nonlinear Klein-Gordon, sine-Gordon, nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear reaction-diffustion, and Euler-Lagrange equations.".
