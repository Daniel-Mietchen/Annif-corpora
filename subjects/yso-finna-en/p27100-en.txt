With the expansion of the EU in 2004, the free movement of workers across the Continent will further affect the employment opportunities of women. This sociological study explores the complex inter-relationship between women's employment, equal opportunities and Women's Studies training. This volume provides unique information about, and insightful analysis of, the changing patterns of women's employment in Europe; equal opportunities in a cross-European perspective; educational migration; gender, race, ethnicity and nationality; and the uneven prevalence and impact of Women's Studies on the lifestyles and everyday practices of those women who have experienced it.

The gender and racial composition of the American workforce is rapidly changing. As more women in particular enter the workforce and as they enter jobs that have traditionally been dominated by men, issues related to sex and gender in work settings have become increasingly important and complex. Research addressing sex and gender in the workplace is conducted in several distinct disciplines, ranging from psychology and sociology to management and economics. Further, books on gender at work often reflect either a more traditional management perspective or a more recent feminist perspective; rarely however, are these two orientations on women and work acknowledged within the same text. Thus, the principle goal of the book is to communicate a variety of social psychological literatures and research on gender issues that affect work behaviors to upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in applied psychology and business.

Women's studies is a rapidly expanding field with a tremendous growth in the number of London courses available. As a result of this there has been increasing debate about the nature of feminist research. Can a specifically feminist methodology be identified? Which research methods are most appropriate in feminist work? What is the difference between a feminist approach and other forms of scholarship.; "Researching Women's Lives" explores these issues by focusing on the dynamics of doing research, rather than engaging in a theoretical discussion about research techniques. Feminists are now involved in exploring a whole range of wider issues concerned with practical, political and ethical matters in undertaking research. In addition to issues such as violence, sexuality, political activity and popular culture, contributors also examine the impact of race, class, sexual orientation and age.

"Italian Feminist Thought" represents a radical re-examination of institutionalized definitions of womens' nature and social role, in relation to the sexual division of labour, the structure of the family and to social welfare, the church and the media. Italian feminism is closely related to political developments from 1966 to the present, and the essays collected here have strong political overtones, revealing a particular emphasis on language as the site of a struggle over meaning, and as the prerequisite for political change. The book includes selections from the works of a wide range of individuals and groups, from Rivolta Femminile to Lesbo Femminismo and Donnawomanfemme. It should be essential reading for anyone concerned with contemporary feminist debates, whether within or outside the academy.

This lucid study moves changing ideas about sex roles from the margins to the center of intellectual history. With superb insight and erudition Rosenberg discerns the connections between social science and feminism which replaced the ideal of 'true womanhood' with 'the new woman' at the turn of the 20th century. Besides brilliantly illuminating the personalities and ideas which led from one intellectual era to another, the book contributes groundbreaking research to the question of feminism's fate in the 1920s.
This text brings together leading feminists who explore questions of feminist interventions in organisations of knowledge production, covering both the structure and culture of academic institutions and the social divisions between women. Feminism is located as a force for change, empowering women to gain a political understanding and providing a methodology for new approaches to teaching, learning, research and writing in the academy. Contributions demonstrate how an analysis of the micropolitics of the academy in terms of power, policies, discourses, pedagogy and interpersonal relationships provides a framework for de- privatising women's experience and influencing change. Using theoretical constructs and their own biographies and experience, the contributors present predicaments, inequalities and strategies. Power and influence are considered in conjunction with gender, 'race', social class and sexuality.
Critical care nursing : a holistic approach
Feminist activism is often taught as an historical phenomenon, and many students entering courses on women's studies are not familiar with current feminist work in the field. This book documents a wide variety of different forms of feminist activism in the 1990s, from organisations such as "Rights for Women" and "Southall Black Sisters" to "Asian Women's Work in Refuges". It raises questions about the meaning of feminist activism and its interpretation within women's studies and other academic disciplines. The chapters suggest, against much current representation within women's studies and elsewhere, that feminism is still alive.; With a comprehensive introduction providing an historical overview of the development of feminist activism from second wave feminism onwards, this text is intended to be of use as a resource for all students of women's studies and related courses.
