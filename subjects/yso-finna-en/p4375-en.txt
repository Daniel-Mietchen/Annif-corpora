"Shaping Interior Space, 3rd Edition, emphasizes the impact that designers make through their spatial compositions and design manipulations. Intended for intermediate and advanced students, the author covers strategies for creating interior environments that work as a total system to enhance the experience of the user. The text places the emphasis on design virtues other than function and aesthetics to more fully address the designer's role in providing appropriate amounts of order, enrichment, and expression. Based on the ten principles introduced in the first chapter, the new edition's reorganization continues to be driven by the sequential presentation of the book's themes and not by the strict sequence of steps in the design process. The revised organization of the table of contents addresses what designers need to know and what designers need to do for their clients"--

INTERIOR DESIGN, DECOR & STYLE GUIDES. Life Unstyled is about taking inspiration from real homes that are beautiful, creative and inspiring but at the same time a little rough around the edges, with signs of everyday life evident throughout. The first section, 'Homes Unstyled', sets out Emily's manifesto for creating a stylish home that is beautiful but lived in. A Home is Never Done advocates allowing your space to evolve gradually so it is an ever-changing expression of your tastes and interests. Work with What You've Got suggests ways to make the most of the home you have rather than yearning for unattainable perfection. Signs of Life offers ideas for wrangling papers, clutter and other stuff. Creative Clutter tackles collections and displays, while Break the Rules rejects style diktats and shows how individuality can bring a home to life.

"Museums are among the iconic buildings of the twenty-first century, as remarkable for their architectural diversity as for the variety of collections they display. But how does the architecture of museums affect our experience as visitors? This book proposes that by seeing space as common ground between architecture and museology, and so between the museum building and its display, we can illuminate the individuality of each museum and the distinctive experience it offers--for example, how some museums create a sense of personal exploration, while others are more intensely didactic, and how the visit in some cases is transformed into a spatial experience and in other cases into a more social event. The book starts with an overview of the history of museum buildings and display strategies, and a discussion of theoretical and critical approaches. It then focuses on specific museums as in-depth case studies, and uses methods of spatial analysis to look at the key design choices available to architects and curators, and their effects on visitors' behaviour. Theoretically grounded, methodologically original, and richly illustrated, this book will equip students, researchers and professionals in the fields of architecture, museum studies, curating, exhibition design, and cultural studies, with a guide for studying museums and a theoretical framework for their interpretation"--Provided by publisher.

"Designing Liners: A History of Interior Design Afloat covers the interior design of these floating palaces from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. The book offers the first history and analysis of this highly significant aspect of the design of interiors, which mirrors and reinforces cultural assumptions about national identity, gender, class and race. The interiors of ocean liners reflect the changing hierarchies of society and shifting patterns in globalization. The trajectory of the professionalization of interior design is the connecting narrative of the book, from the local decorating firm to the internationally renowned architect." "This book provides the first survey of the transient history of interior design in relation to the development of passenger shipping. The history of these great ship interiors is tracked, from their commissioning by the line owners; the materials, methods and sources for the initial creation; their construction; their use and reception. Drawing on a broad range of original research, Anne Wealleans' approach combines design history, architectural history, and material and visual culture."--BOOK JACKET.
