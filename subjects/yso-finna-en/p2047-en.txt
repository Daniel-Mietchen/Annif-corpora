This thesis was planned according to the needs of the case company, which is a Finnish company in the brewing and soft drink industry. The company's interest was to ease the tendering of sea freight when exporting. The project objective was to design an electronic tendering form for sea freight. In order to collect data to support the designing of the form, a literature review and a small-scale qualitative research were. The literature review studied maritime export and tendering process, as well as the transportation of the export goods. The author implemented a qualitative research in order to gain a deeper understanding of freight forwarding, freight rates and the features that would make the tendering form functional. The author interviewed three (3) freight-forwarding companies for the research. The author also studied the case company's previously used method of tendering. The data collection methods for this consisted of interviews, phone calls and emails with the contact people from the case company, as well as secondary data in the form of previous tenders. The time span of the project was roughly a year. The contract was signed in December 2012 and the project was completed in November 2013. The outcome of the project is an Excel document, which encloses instructions sheet, tender sheets, an additional sheet to ease the collection of primary data from the tenders, as well as a complementary cover letter containing further information required by the tenderers. The final products of the thesis is available in the Attachments 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Abstract: This study was commissioned by Ewals Cargo Care, which transports cargo with Mega trailers in Europe using a number of intermodal solutions to achieve cost-efficient transport for the needs of the customers. The main objective of this study was to determine the estimated sea freight rates increase in 2015 when the tighter sulphur directive will come into force. The objective was also to find out the current situation and the commercial value of the Baltic Sea as well as solutions for the ship-ping companies to respond to tighter sulphur directive.  The purpose of this study was to calculate the estimated increase of the sea freight rates in a few routes so that Ewals Cargo Care could prepare for possible rise in pric-es in the near future. The study was divided into theoretical and empirical part with equal proportions. Theory section introduces the commercial situation of the Baltic Sea, the sulphur directive and the structure of the shipping costs.  In the empirical analysis part the new freight rates were calculated, solutions for tighter suphur directive challenges was searched and two interviews were held with shipping companies which are in cooperation with Ewals Cargo Care. Interviews and calculations are also the part of the execution of the study which also is the major research process.  After the empirical part of the study results were reviewed and conclusions of the studied subject were presented. Frames of the interviews, tables of the current and new freight rates are attached in the end of the study.

This thesis was commissioned by the sea import department of DSV Air & Sea Oy. The purpose of this final thesis was to create an orientation folder for a new employee and for the use of the current employees acting as their instructor. As the need for the thesis rose from practice, the thesis type is functional final thesis.    Methods used in this final thesis include a theoretical framework, an interview with the HR-manager of DSV Finland and utilization of writer's own professional experience. The theoretical framework is combined from the theory of orientation and basics of freight forwarding and sea mode transportation. The theory of orientation is build from the definition of orientation, reasons and benefits of it, what the actual orientation process is and the evaluation of the orientation at the end of the process. The theory of freight forwarding and sea mode transportation in the latter part of the theoretical framework gives an insight to the traffic coordinator's work by introducing importing from the third countries as well as different customs procedures.     The orientation folder was divided in to two parts based on the results of the theoretical framework, employment related issues and instructor's guidebook. The first part, employment related issues, is targeted for the new employee to introduce them to the practical issues regarding employment at DSV Air & Sea Oy. The second part, the instructor's guidebook, is for the use of both the new employee as well as their instructor. The instructor's guidebook aims to give the new employee all the essential, basic guidelines of the work of a traffic coordinator. The actual product is not included in this thesis due to the confidential nature of the company information it contains.    The implementation chapter of the thesis report contains a portrayal of the methods used to develop the final product as well a description of the orientation folder. Evaluation of the final product is also included in the implementation. The final part of the thesis report, the discussion, summarizes the results of the complete project and the final product.    The orientation folder has been checked and accepted by the head of the sea import department at DSV Air & Sea Oy. It meets the required standards and the expectations set for it by the writer and the commissioning company and it is considered to have improved the inner orientation process at DSV Air & Sea Oy. As a conclusion, the aim set for this thesis was achieved.
Commodity trade (by sea) statistics. Results of the maritime transport study for the years 1972-1975 : analysis by type of goods moved during 1972-1975 between regions of the world
The objective of this bachelor thesis was to study the effects the transition from air freight to maritime shipments and hub model will have on Bayer Oy?s export processes and transport planning. Furthermore, to display the benefits the transition can offer to Bayer Oy, and to understand the hub model implementation processes from the point of view of the pilot shipment to Israel. This thesis is a hybrid of the qualitative and quantitative research methods. First a throughout understanding of the transition process was achieved with the qualitative research methods, such as studying the current literature and publications released in the field. Additionally, an open-ended questioner was conducted with the research field experts in the sponsor company to gain insight of the operational changes. In order to verify the hypothesis concerning the expected benefits, a quantitative cost comparison was conducted. The cost analysis included the comparison between the direct reefer containers and airfreight, as well as between the pallet prices via hub model versus airfreight. Ancillary savings from the packing changes were also presented. The implementation process of the pilot hub model shipment to Israel was divided into four sections; route changes, TM3 planning, documentation and cost savings. The results of this thesis presented the operational changes caused by the transition, the potential cost savings and the implementation process of the pilot hub model shipment to Israel. Additionally, further research subjects were presented such as improving communication throughout the distribution chain, risk assessment for brakes in the manufacturing process and the correlation issue between the scheduling of the direct truck to HUB Velten and the container closing dates of different destinations.
