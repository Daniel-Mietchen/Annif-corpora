Without the body there would be no feminist theory. And it's possible to say that without feminist theory there would be no modern "body." The body has long been a contested site in feminist circles. From debates about motherhood, pregnancy, and abortion, discussions of pleasure and sex, to more philosophical discussions of embodiment and the gendering of bodies, the major thinkers of feminist theory have reshaped our ideas of how women and men understand what the body is. In "Feminist Theory and the Body" Price and Shildrick bring together over 40 of the world's greatest feminist writers to represent the key arguments from all of the different feminist schools of thought on the body. The book's seven sections cover Woman as Body?, Sexy Bodies, Bodies in Science and Biomedicine, After the Binary, Altered Bodies, BodySpaceMatter and Performing the Body. It includes articles on race, cyberspace, theatre, classics, transsexuality, reproductive technologies, illness, rape, plastic surgery, disabilities and much, much more.

Bigger, smaller, fatter, thinner women's bodies have been one of the most contested sites in human history. Men's bodies have rarely been assigned much more than a sketchy role as heroic, but women's bodies are surrounded by cultural, religious, social and political taboos and strictures. And for large stretches of history, women have had little control or power over their own bodies. Edward Shorter explores the long history of women's oppression through their bodies and the thinking behind it. Why did Aristotle think that women were misbegotten men and why was Sir William Blackstone in the 18th century codification of law that bears his name able to promote the view that women experience "civil death" in marriage, giving their husbands complete rights and responsibilities over their wives' bodies. It was, argues Shorter, the end of women's physical victimization that was the precondition for feminism.
