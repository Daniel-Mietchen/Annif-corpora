Abstract: The microclimates of the Kevo IBP (International Biological Programme) ecosystem study sites are discussed. Comparisons between the sites and the meteorological station are made by means of word models and regression and correlation analyses. Several ecologically meaningsful climatological data are given as monthly and other averages. General descriptions of the study sites are also given.
