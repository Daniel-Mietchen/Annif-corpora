This volume is the latest edition of an international edited book series based on the formation and growth problems of High Technology Small Firms (HTSFs) begun in 1993. This body of work is unique, and maps the evolution of research in this area through almost two decades of academic research and government policy towards a sector that is the key to future prosperity of developed and developing notational economies throughout the world. In this the latest Volume, there is one major and two subsidiary themes that have emerged from the best papers to be presented at the HTSF Conference held at the University of Twente at Enshede in May 2008. Following a contextual introduction by the editors, seven of the chapter are concerned with the key issue of strategy, which is always a key concern for HTSFs as they seek to find the best way to getting their products to the market. Indeed, a further two papers are concerned with the requirements of international marketing, while a final three papers deal with aspects of education for HTSF founders.

Value creation and structural change during the third industrial revolution : the Swedish economy from a vertical perspective
The poverty and underdevelopment in a country like India calls for action. CSR, fueled by economic growth and public expectations, has the potential of becoming one of the driving forces behind development and in the longer perspective a way of achieving a sustainable society. However, this is not the only possible outcome. Although CSR seems to have a great potential to play a role in the development of society, there is no guarantee that it will actually do so. Not until firms realize the economic benefits from using CSR such as easier hiring and higher retention rates of their employees, we will see true CSR engagement. The interest in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which recognizes that companies have obligations that extend beyond short-run profit maximization to include notions of social and environmental concern, has increased considerably in recent decades. The globalization of the world economy and the related trade liberalization has brought forward a discussion of the importance of business as an actor in the development of society. Due to the vast and diverse nature of previous researches in the area, the aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how the concept of CSR is incorporated particularly in the operations of an info-tech company in India. In order to provide clarity to the issue, five interviews were procured from different IT companies all varying in size and scale of operation and all of them being located in New Delhi, India. Documentation and interviews were used as data collection methods for this thesis. The main finding of this study is that the evolving nature of CSR strategies in the Indian info-tech sector does have a positive attitude and would play an increasingly important role in developing and the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society in the near future. While at the same time the CSR agenda in India is on track to emerge as a more balanced and better integrated in terms of keeping in mind all the stakeholders point of view.
