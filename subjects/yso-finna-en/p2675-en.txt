Interest in contemporary slavery has increased dramatically over the last ten years, but there remains a widespread tendency to view slavery in the past and slavery in current society as independent fields of study. This book provides a comparative analysis of historical slave systems and modern forms of human bondage. From this standpoint, recent concerns over human trafficking, debt-bondage, child labor and other related problems are analyzed in view of the historical strengths and weaknesses of the legal abolition of slavery. By bringing together a range of studies on different aspects of slavery, both past and present, this book provides a platform for promoting dialogue about ways of addressing both contemporary slavery and the enduring legacies of historical slave systems.--Publisher's description.

Presenting a wealth of highly original and innovative analyses and case studies, this book examines the strategic ties between various emerging economies, their different approaches to finding mutual trade solutions, and new trends in the use of contingent protection. The research methodology can also be applied to the study of specific Latin American countries or other developed or developing states in comparison to China. The book presents new theories and offers a valuable template for further studies in this area. Further, the application of the New Haven approach can further develop the studies' potential to offer guidance in a broader context.
