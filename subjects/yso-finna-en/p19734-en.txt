Fashion illustration today
"The global interest in menswear has exploded in recent years as the discerning man, whatever his style, looks to express himself through fashion. As a result the industry has seen the rise of a new breed of menswear illustrators who are redefining the industry and its visuals through works commissioned for the pages of GQ, Dazed & Confused, and Vogue Hommes, as well as for the campaigns of Carhartt, Thom Browne, Alexander McQueen, Prada, and Christian Dior, among others. This inspiring survey of contemporary men's fashion drawing introduces a generation of illustrators who approach fashion image-making with sophisticated artistry. From the exuberant street sketches of Richard Haines, made rapidly on the streets of New York, to the delicate drawings of C©♭dric Rivrain or the bold graphic approach of Donald Urquhart, these groundbreaking talents are expanding our perceptions of the modern man. Richard Kilroy, a top menswear illustrator in his own right, introduces and contextualizes the movement before bringing together designers' sketches, street-style reportage, editorial coverage, and commissions for leading brands. Whether drawn in pencil, splashed across a sketchbook, or digitally rendered, the illustrations are as varied in style as menswear itself."--Publisher's website.
