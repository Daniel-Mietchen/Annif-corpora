"Public Sector Management is a core textbook that provides a historical background to the emergence and development of the public sector. It offers an up-to-date and stimulating assessment of the contemporary challenges facing the public sector in developed economies. The book argues that public sector management theories evolved during the highly stable world of the second half of the 20th century, and they need reconsideration in a world being made increasingly uncertain due to the combined influence of "meta-events" such as population aging, globalization and the current financial crisis in many developed nation economies. The book presents the perspective, supported by real world case examples, that development of appropriate strategies for ensuring the long term survival of public sector organizations requires a strategic orientation focused upon a willingness to embrace change, accompanied by a commitment to exploiting innovation and entrepreneurship.
