This book unveils a corner of human history which has hitherto been unexplored and is therefore unknown. It tells the story of why and how Francis Maginn, a deaf Irishman from Cork, inspired the formation of the oldest Association of Deaf Peole in the United Kingdom. The origin and development of the British Deaf Association can be understood only against the background of the fate of Deaf People in recent centuries. Their advance is a tale which should be of great interest and full of surprises to deag and hearing readers alike.

Abstract: Comparing strategic management between the United Kingdom's and Finland's ice hockey organizations, from the point of view of two same levelled teams. The potential of making a profit from the game of ice-hockey is relatively common, not only for professional teams, but also lower levelled teams, thus they have the potential to grow as an organisation. The UK's highest level called the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) attracts a lot of viewers and thus makes a lot of profit from ticket sales and fan equipment. According to marketing and communications executive for the team Cardiff Devils, Evans-Determan (2010), in the season 2009-2010 the ice hockey team from Nottingham Panthers (EIHL) attracted on average 4234 fans per game. This shows that the demand for ice hockey is relatively high in the UK and not as small as what is commonly thought. This paper will compare two same levelled team's strategic management from two diverse market environments and determine the structural differences in how they operate. Additionally, it will show what potential growth opportunities these organisations have and what ideas and operations they could adapt from one another in order to be more successful than what they currently are. The study will provide research of customer demand, as well as point out what business theories the teams are using or should be using in order to achieve their mission and vision statements. The two teams chosen for this research are Blackburn Hawks from the United Kingdom, who play in the ENL-league (England National League) and Vuosaaren Viikingit from Finland, who play in the Division II-league (4th highest level in Finland).
