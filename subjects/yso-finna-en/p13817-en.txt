Simkin & Norman's 12th Edition of Concepts of Accounting Information Systems builds upon previous issues with more in-depth focus on topical issues essential to accountants such as Sarbanes-Oxley, Cobit Version 4, XBRL, and of risk and governance in a much more concise, user-friendly way. More Case in Point sections highlight how the concepts are applied in the field and additional multiple choice questions have been added at the end of the chapters to help reinforce the material. An enhanced and updated database chapter also provides hands-on instruction in Microsoft Access.

Abstract: The object of the study was to clarify the functionality of the internal supply chain based on forecast for the target company. The study addressed the following questions: 1) the status of the functionality of the internal supply chain processes based on forecast, 2) how the forecast information in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system could serve production's planning and purchase processes and 3) how the Overall Planning module could serve the above-mentioned processes. A definition of the forecast process is also included in order to get a better description of the whole process chain.  The theoretical section of the master's thesis was based on the analysis of the forecast, Supply Chain Management (SCM), Internal Supply Chain Management (ISCM) and ERP system. The risks of SCM have also been described. The study focused extensively on the production- and purchase planning and the functionality of the Overall Planning module, which is a part of the ERP system.  The empirical section of the master's thesis was collected by theme interviews in the case company Eskimo Finland Oy in July â€“ December 2014. The interviews were based on questionnaires tailored suitable for different departments. The observation part was accomplished during the autumn 2014. The results gave the conclusions that the processes included manual steps, which could be made more efficiently by using the forecast information via the Overall Planning module in the ERP system. Benefits of both Calculation Run of Needs application (MRP) and Overall Planning module could be used better to reduce lead times.
