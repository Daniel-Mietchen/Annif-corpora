Methods to incorporate the amenity of landscape into forest management planning
Volume 2: Focuses on the tensions that arise between people and wildlife on agricultural land, and explores how to mitigate them. It investigates the common sources of conflict and the consequential threats to conservation, discussing a variety of solutions and demonstrating the benefits of an evidence-based, interdisciplinary strategy.

The world of garden design : inspiring ideas from around the globe to your backyard
Landscape evaluation : approaches and applications
Provides a combination of selected case studies, combined with authoritative and thought-provoking editorial syntheses, to demonstrate how ecological study (often long term), combined with a flexible, interdisciplinary approach, is a consistently effective strategy to tackle the most pressing challenges facing farmers, conservationists, and policy makers today. It is aimed at student and professional academics as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers, both government and non-government.
Landscape boundaries : consequences for biotic diversity and ecological flows
Changing landscapes : an egological perspective
Wildlife conservation on farmland. Volume 1, Managing for nature on lowland farms
All over the world, efforts are being made to preserve landscapes facing fundamental change as a consequence of widespread agricultural intensification, land abandonment and urbanisation. The 'cultural' and 'resilience' approaches have, until now, largely been viewed as distinct methods for understanding the effects of these dynamics, and the ways in which they might be adapted or managed.

Resource assessment in forested landscapes
Garden Revolution shows how an ecological approach to planting can lead to beautiful gardens that buck much of conventional gardening's counter-productive, time-consuming practices. Instead of picking the wrong plant and then constantly tilling, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing, Larry Weaner advocates for choosing plants that are adapted to the soil and climate of a specific site and letting them naturally evolve over time.

Multifunctional landscapes. Vol. 1, Theory, values and history
Volume 1: Integrates more than 30 years of research by the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford to reveal how agricultural systems and wildlife interact, presenting examples from scales varying from microcosm to landscape, individuals to populations, and covering plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, with the purpose of fortifying the evidence base for managing outcomes. It considers the implications of agricultural development for natural habitats, biodiversity, and the provision of essential ecosystem services.
