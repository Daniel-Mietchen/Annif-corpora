The Dutch response to HIV pragmatism and consensus
In the early twentieth century, ambitious social welfare campaigns linked the improvement of health to the broader aim of "modernizing" American life. Lowered mortality rates, especially among infants and young children, became for reformers a barometer by which to measure society's overall "progress". To date, most analyses of Progressive Era child welfare movements have concentrated on urban areas in the Northeast and the national leadership role played by the Children's Bureau. Modern Mothers in the Heartland, in contrast, shifts the focus to the Midwest. Illinois provides an interesting case study because its rates of infant and maternal mortality tended to be higher than those of other midwestern states, and Chicago's rates were consistently higher than those of other major industrial centers. Drawing on local and state sources to reconstruct the nature of maternal and child health work, Lynne Curry highlights the interactive character of health reform: policy makers, clients of community health services, practitioners, and the volunteers who worked with them negotiated the final outcomes of the campaign's stated aims. Situating maternal and child health reform in its historical and regional contexts, this study uses information about Illinois's distinctive social, economic, and political history - even its geography - to enhance the analytical picture.

The tracheobronchial tree is open to the environment surrounding the body. Respiration has thus the essential bearing on general morbidity, vulnerability to disease and immunity. Further, respiratory function shapes the neuropsychological responses to succumbing to disease, controls the mind-to-body interaction and sets the perception of quality of life. The chapters of this book deal with the preventable drivers of poor respiratory health, the role of health information technology, the improvement in health care delivery and the integration of respiratory health and behavioral health services. Innovative strategies to promote prevention, care coordination and care integration as well as to align disease acceptance and quality of life measures also are tackled. Maintaining respiratory health is of rising research interest as a way of preventing a disease or a non pharmacological therapeutic succor. The book will be of interest to clinicians, family practitioners and medical researchers.

About your body
Health education : effectiveness, efficiency and equity
A Curriculum of Wellness seeks to encourage a deeper discussion about teaching our children how to be healthy and live well. It makes a significant contribution to the field of education as it features influential curriculum concepts nuanced with action research principles in a unified, intimate, and deeply relational inquiry into physical education teacher practice. This work presents a very practical yet complex and wisdom-guided way to transform teaching practices that follow more holistic understandings of wellness. A new mode of curriculum inquiry, wisdom-guided inquiry, is presented, providing an opportunity to open up a fresh avenue to understand curriculum and become engaged in discussions that concern teaching, learning, and public education. An outstanding feature of this book is its transdisciplinarity. While the story is situated within physical education discipline, this book has implications for all teachers and teacher educators because it provides insights that encourage us to consider more carefully the subjective insights of teachers and to understand these as central to being and becoming a teacher.
