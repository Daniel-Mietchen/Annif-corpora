The book presents the latest advances in research into health effects of air pollution, with heavy motor vehicle traffic or cigarette smoke as the exemplar of pollution. The airways are the first-line defense system against pollution. The book focuses on respiratory ailments underlain by inflammation, increased susceptibility to infection, particularly acquired during harsh environmental conditions and exposures to particulate matter or pathogens. The importance of astute analysis of lung function for early diagnosis of disorders is underscored. A knowledge deficit concerning the aerosolized drug delivery through the airways also is addressed. Recent developments and viewpoints in the field of environmental health hazards as well as methodological advances in their assessment are provided. The book will be of interest to pulmonologists, healthcare providers, researchers and clinicians engaged in environment-related respiratory diseases, but also to policy makers concerned with clean ambient air quality.

Long-term evaluation of mass-BCG-vaccination campaign : a study of thirty years of experience in Finland
The respiratory tract is a frequent target of infections caused by a wide range of organisms. The book provides reader-friendly information on aspects of pulmonary infections, including comprehensive accounts of bacterial and viral diseases, therapeutic approaches, molecular and classical culture-related techniques of diagnosis, and explaining the basic cell biological mechanism. The role of oxidative stress, both helpful in fighting invading pathogens and detrimental in yielding to infection is detailed as it is often undervalued and needs focus. The chapters encompass latest developments and applications in bacteriology and virology, preventive and therapeutic tips, and raise attention to implementation of proper antibiotic policies by medical institutions to decrease resistance to antimicrobials. The perennial problem of low influenza vaccination coverage rate is rationalized. The volume will be of interest to both clinicians and biomedical researchers engaged in this exciting field.

"Biotechnology is delivering not only new products to diagnose, prevent, and treat human diseases but entirely new approaches to a wide range of difficult biomedical challenges. Because of advances in biotechnlogy, hundreds of new therapeutic agents, diagnostic tests, and vaccines have been developed and are available in the marketplace. In this jargon-free, easy-to-read textbook, the authors demystify the discipline of medical biotechnology and provide a fundamental understanding of the wide-ranging approaches pursued by scientists to diagnose, prevent, and treat medical conditions."--Back cover.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant pathogen in developing countries causing mortality especially among children and the elderly. The development of new pneumococcal vaccines has reduced the amount of serious infections, but several pneumococcal serotypes set a great challenge in the battle against the pathogen. Zebrafish is an excellent model for various infections due to its developed immune system. Zebrafish is easy to maintain and it has many characteristics that make it a widely used animal model. The aim of this study was to set up a model for Streptococcus pneumonia infection in adult zebrafish and to find out if zebrafish can be used in the development of pneumococcal vaccines. The purpose was to find a dose of bacteria that kills half of the test animals, find out the role of pneumococcal virulence factors, and to examine the clearance of S. pneumoniae from the zebrafish blood stream. The purpose was also to find out if two commercial pneumococcal vaccines give zebrafish protection against the Streptococcus pneumonia infection. For the study, the zebrafish were infected intraperitoneally with a wild-type S. pneumoniae and mutants lacking certain virulence factors. The progression of pneumococcal infection was studied by following the mortality and bacteria concentration of blood. For testing the vaccines, fish were injected intramuscularly with the vaccines. The vaccinated fish were infected with wild-type pneumococcus to find out the effects of the vaccines. The results showed that a dose of 5 x 106 colony forming units of wild-type Streptococcus pneumoniae killed approximately half of the fish. Most of the surviving fish were able to clear the bacteria within 24 hours. S. pneumoniae entered the bloodstream very rapidly and was able to multiply in zebrafish. The bacterial concentration continues to grow within six hours post-infection. After 12 hours, the amount of bacteria decreased rapidly and by the next day most of the fish had cleared the bacteria. The mutant experiments indicated that capsule is a crucial virulence factor along with autolysin and pneumolysin. The lack of pili had no effect on the mortality rates when compared with wild-type infections.

The study was carried out to know the attitude of childbearing mothers towards immunization in the USA. It is conducted as a consequence of a rapidly increasing level of immunization non-compliance among mothers. The incidence of non-compliance as mentioned is not considered high. However, there are strong indications that the number will increase in the absence of mass consciousness, awareness and vaccine education. Immunization is very essential because it is an important aspect of preventive medicine. It provides protection against specific bacterial and viral infections. It means the artificial production of immune bodies to protect the body against invasion of certain diseases. This research was undertaken by making use of Qualitative Research Method. The researcher investigated different factors contributing to non-compliance to immunization. The consultation of academic sources was significant to achieving results during literature reviews e.g. journals, articles, internet (official) pages and textbooks. The responses to research questions are based on critical and observatory analysis of authors` accounts on the subject.

This volume provides a modern look on the age-old influenza infection and the preventive role of anti-influenza shots. Influenza pandemic outbreaks are unrelenting despite the growing understanding of the molecular basis of viral infection and its spreads. A leap in medical technologies has revolutionized the design of new influenza vaccines. The chapters cover vaccination strategies in various age-groups of people and provide the extensive amount of knowledge on the immune response to influenza vaccination in a spectrum of disease conditions.

Helminth infections are common, cause considerable pathology, and alter a host's immune profile. This can have important consequences not only on the host's ability to control a helminth infection, but also on their ability to control unrelated infections. In endemic areas, understanding how helminth infection influences the outcome of common infectious diseases and changes the efficacy of childhood vaccination programs is an important public health question. This book reviews how host immunity to helminths alters our ability to respond to the major pathogens that exist in helminth endemic regions. Current understanding of how helminths alter important but relatively neglected contributors to the host's anti-helminth immune responses are addressed, namely host antibody responses and how maternal infection may alter a child's immune development. These are discussed in relation to the control of helminth infection and unrelated infections. Also covered are how helminth infections alter the host's ability to control TB, HIV and malarial infections along with neglected bacterial infections, such as cholera, and how endemic helminth infections are likely to alter our ability to respond to life-saving vaccination strategies.
