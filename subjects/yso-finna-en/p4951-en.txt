All service situations are influenced by the environment in which the service is provided. The environment is as important of a factor as service and can be perceived positively or negatively. Providing a quality servicescape seems to be becoming a prerequisite for maintaining a competitive edge. Any service minded organization striving for success and profitability should understand the importance of a servicescape.     The Think Tank meeting room has been created in Sweden after a survey on the needs of meeting guests was conducted. Scandic created a concept “MEETING” in order to ensure the same level of standards in all Scandics.     The aim of this study is to establish if the Think Tank brand is suitable for the Finnish market, since no market research has been conducted in Finland before the launch of the product.     This survey has been conducted by using quantitative study as the research method. Statistical data was collected by dealing out questionnaires to the meeting guests that visited the Think Tank room at the Scandic Grand Marina in Helsinki. The measurement tool, SERVICESCAPE together with Feng Shui, was used to analyze the results and findings of the study.     The results of the findings were highly affected by the low respondent rate. Yet some interesting points were found. Some products had a more significant role than others in the meeting room and divided more the opinions of the respondents. According to the results recommendations could be made on minder adjustments to increase the level of satisfaction of the Think Tank room. The statistical data combined with the generally positive feedback of the servicescape indicated that the Think Tank meeting room and its products suit the meeting guests in Filand well.
