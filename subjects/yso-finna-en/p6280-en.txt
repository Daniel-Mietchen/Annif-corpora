The function of the transmembrane protein FasL is to complex with the Fas receptor in a target cell and induce target cell apoptosis. Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays important role in immunoregulation. FasL expression is mostly seen in activated lymphocytes. We have characterized endothelial FasL expression in different functional compartments of lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, we have explored the functional role of endothelial FasL expression by analyzing correlation with apoptosis of lymphocyte subpopulations in lymph nodes and by assessing endothelial expression under different conditions by activation of immune functions in gastrointestinal mucosa. Immunohistochemical stainings (Fas, FasL, CD3, CD20, CD19, CD23, CD56, FVIII) were performed on 20 reactive lymph node tissues (I and II), 60 pediatric endoscopy biopsy samples (III) or 60 samples from gut resections (IV). A double-staining method combining apoptosis detection with the TUNEL-method and lymphocyte classification with FasL, Fas and cell lineage markers was optimized. Patient groups included non-pathological lymph nodes, pediatric cow's milk-sensitive enteropathy, pediatric celiac disease, appendicitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Control groups included normal biopsy samples from pediatric patients and non-pathological resecate samples from the appendix, colon or ileum to correspond to patient groups. Quantitative analysis (positive vessels or cells per mm2) was performed thoroughly for each anatomical region. In a subset of patients, soluble FasL in the serum was quantified with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In reactive lymph nodes FasL expression was predominantly present in high endothelial venules located in the paracortical area, where apoptotic T and B lymphocytes, some expressing Fas, were subsequently found. In the gut wall vascular FasL expression was seen in high endothelial vessels near lymphoid follicles. Serum FasL was elevated in children with an abundance of mucosal lymphoid follicles. In IBD, vascular FasL was upregulated in ulcers and in the submucosa of colons affected by Crohn's disease.The results indicate that endothelial FasL is characteristically present in high endothelial venules of lymphoid tissues. Detection of apoptotic Fas expressing lymphocytes adjacent to such vessels supports the idea that endothelial FasL functions as a selective gatekeeper by inducing apoptosis of Fas+ lymphocytes entering from the blood stream.

Trojan is a novel leukocyte-specific protein cloned from chicken (Gallus gallus) embryonic thymocytes. The molecule is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular CCP domain followed by two FN3 domains. Its cytoplasmic tail is predicted to possess a MAPK docking and a PKA phosphorylation site. Trojan displays differential expression on developing thymocyte subpopulations. It is high on CD4 and CD8 double negative, and CD4 or CD8 single positive cells, but diminishes from the surface of selection-undergoing CD4 and CD8 double positive cells. This expression pattern is similar to that of anti-apoptotic molecules such as IL-7RÎ± and BCL-2. We hypothesised an involvement of Trojan in the regulation of apoptosis, possibly as an anti-apoptotic receptor. Our in vitro studies with a T cell line showed that upon apoptosis induction, Trojan expression rises dramatically on the surface of surviving cells and gradually decreases towards its normal levels as cells recover. When sorted based on their Trojan levels, cells with high expression appear less susceptible to apoptotic induction than those bearing no Trojan on their surface. Cells that overexpress Trojan from a cDNA plasmid show elevated steady state intracellular calcium, suggesting the molecule is able to transmit cytoplasmic signals. In addition, computational analyses pointed towards an involvement of MAPK and a possible regulatory mechanism by PKA.Trojan belongs to a novel gene family that includes two other members in the chicken. One is a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase named Mystran, and the other - a transmembrane protein with an ITAM, named Thracian. We discovered the family in other avian species and found related genes in reptiles and coalecanth fish. We observed dynamic adaptation of their extracellular regions possibly in concert with ligand-binding, association with other surface molecules or as a response to pathogen challenges. This was coupled to largely unchanged cytoplasmic tails, suggesting a conserved signalling mechanism.The presented study shows that a novel avian leukocyte protein called Trojan possibly has an anti-apoptotic role. It belongs to a gene family that was subjected to evolutionary selection, likely linked to the molecular function of the proteins.
