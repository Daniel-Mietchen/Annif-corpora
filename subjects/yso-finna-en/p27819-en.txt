Stage management : a practical guide
The book offers readers a practical manual on how to stage manage in all theatre environments. Revered as the authoritative resource for stage management, this text is rich with practical resources, including checklists, diagrams, examples, forms and step-by-step directions. In addition to sharing his own expertise, Stern has gathered practical advice from working stage managers of Broadway, off-Broadway, touring companies, regional, community, and 99-seat Equity waiver theaters. In its 11th edition, the book is now fully in color and updated to include new information on Equity contracts, social media applications in stage management, and working with high school productions.
