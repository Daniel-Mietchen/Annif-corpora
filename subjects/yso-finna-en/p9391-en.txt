Revenue is the "top" line on the income statement and is the fundamental driver of business success. It is essential that managers and executives understand the complexities involved in recognizing revenue under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the US Revenue Recognition principles are , are primarily concerned with two things: (a) the timing aspect (the when issue) and (b) the amount to be recorded (the how much issue). This book will provide extensive guidance in assisting managers with the appropriate answers to the two questions above for their companies. This book is principally designed for managers and executives who have organizational responsibility for delivering results in the form of "profits" for their organizations. The book will be a comprehensive yet readable examination of the existing rules of revenue recognition for corporate entities. After reading the book, the manager or executive will have a thorough understanding of how accountants measure and record revenue. This "skill-set" will prove invaluable in understanding the impact that their business decisions will have on the financial statements with an emphasis on the income statement and the statement of cash flows. The book will also have an executive-level overview of the proposed "IASB and FASB Standard: Revenue from Contracts with Customers."

The systematic and adequate maintenance of historical buildings is essential for their preservation. The same goes for monumental buildings - churches, palaces, archaeological sites - and utilitarian buildings like schools, hospitals factories selected for preservation and those "architettura minore" - the traditional edifices representing local craftmanship and use of local materials and techniques, architecture without arhitects, such as the wooden constructions found in Finland's countryside and towns. What happens when the maintenance is not sufficient, when it is necessary to apply conservation methods or even restoration to prevent further losses and deterioration, to ensure the preservation of the monument? Are restoration principles valid when treating wooden architecture?.

Moral Realism is a systematic defence of the idea that there are objective moral standards. In the tradition of Plato and G. E. Moore, Russ Shafer-Landau argues that there are moral principles that are true independently of what anyone, anywhere, happens to think of them. These principles are a fundamental aspect of reality, just as much as those that govern mathematics or the natural world. They may be true regardless of our ability to grasp them, and their truth is not a matter of their being ratified from any ideal standpoint, nor of being the object of actual or hypothetical consensus, nor of being an expression of our rational nature. Shafer-Landau accepts Plato's and Moore's contention that moral truths are sui generis. He rejects the currently popular efforts to conceive of ethics as a kind of science, and insists that moral truths and properties occupy a distinctive area in our ontology. Unlike scientific truths, the fundamental moral principles are knowable a priori. And unlike mathematical truths, they are essentially normative: intrinsically action-guiding, and supplying a justification for all who follow their counsel.Moral Realism is the first comprehensive treatise defending non-naturalistic moral realism in over a generation. It ranges over all of the central issues in contemporary metaethics, and will be an important source of discussion for philosophers and their students interested in issues concerning the foundations of ethics.

"Conservation: Principles, Dilemmas, and Uncomfortable Truths presents multi-perspective critical analyses of the ethics and principles that guide the conservation of works of art and design, archaeological artefacts, buildings, monuments, and heritage sites on behalf of society. Contributors from the fields of philosophy, sociology, history, art and design history, museology, conservation, architecture, and planning and public policy address a wide range of conservation principles, practices, and theories from the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, encouraging the reader to make comparisons across subjects and disciplines. By wrestling with and offering ways of disentangling the ethical dilemmas confronting those who maintain and sustain cultural heritage for today and tomorrow, 'Conservation: Principles, Dilemmas, and Uncomfortable Truths' provides an essential reference text for conservation professionals, museum and heritage professionals, art and cultural historians, lecturers and students, and all others invested in cultural heritage theories and practices."--Publisher's description.
Challenges the entrenched understandings of Machiavelli, arguing that he was a moral and political philosopher who consistently favored the rule of law over that of men, that he had a coherent theory of justice, and that he did not defend the 'Machiavellian' maxim that the ends justify the means.
