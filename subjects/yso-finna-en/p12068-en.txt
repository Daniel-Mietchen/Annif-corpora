the other hand, the devices operate slower and the widely used 6T SRAM cells become unreliable. As countermeasures, longer paths in the logic circuits and larger transistor sizes in the memory structures are shown to be effective ways of compensating the downsides of the Near-Threshold Computing. The results give a basis for low-power IC circuit designing, if the normal supply voltage with no drawbacks should be used, or if reduced voltage levels should be used and the drawbacks tolerated somehow.

"Introductory material will consider the problem of embedded image processing, and how some of the issues may be solved using parallel hardware solutions. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are introduced as a technology that provides flexible, fine-grained hardware that can readily exploit parallelism within many image processing algorithms. A brief review of FPGA programming languages provides the link between a software mindset normally associated with image processing algorithms, and the hardware mindset required for efficient utilization of a parallel hardware design. The bulk of the book will focus on the design process, and in particular how designing an FPGA implementation differs from a conventional software implementation. Particular attention is given to the techniques for mapping an algorithm onto an FPGA implementation, considering timing, memory bandwidth and resource constraints, and efficient hardware computational techniques. Extensive coverage will be given of a range of image processing operations, discussing efficient implementations and how these may vary according to the application. The techniques will be illustrated with several example applications or case studies from projects or applications I have been involves with. Issues such as interfacing between the FPGA and peripheral devices will be covered briefly, as will designing the system in such a way that it can be more readily debugged and tuned"--

"Chapter 1 Sets and Functions This chapter introduces two major notions: sets and functions. We are all familiar with real functions, for example f(x} = 2x + 1 and g(x} = sin(x). Here the approach is somewhat different. The first difference is that we do not limit the discussion to the set of real numbers. Instead, we consider arbitrary sets, and are mostly interested in sets that contain only a finite number of elements. The second difference is that we do not define a 'rule" for assigning a value for each x. Instead, a function is simply a list of pairs (x,y), where y denotes the value of the function when the argument equals x. The definition of functions relies on the definitions of sets and relations over sets. That is why we need to define various operations over sets such as: union, intersection, complement, and Cartesian product. The focus of this book is Boolean functions. Boolean functions are a special family of functions. Their arguments and values are finite sequences of zero and ones (also called bits). In this chapter we show how to represent a Boolean function by a truth table and multiplication tables. Other representations presented later in the book are: Boolean formulas and combinational circuits"--

This book examines in detail the basic properties and design, including chip integration, of CMOS and bipolar VLSI devices and discusses the various factors that affect their performance. The authors begin with a thorough review of the relevant aspects of semiconductor physics, and proceed to a description of the design of CMOS and bipolar devices. The optimization of these devices for VLSI applications is also covered. The authors highlight the intricate interdependencies and subtle tradeoffs between those device parameters, such as power consumption and packing density, that affect circuit performance and manufacturability. They also discuss in detail the scaling, and physical limits to the scaling, of CMOS and bipolar devices. The book contains many exercises, and can be used as a textbook for senior undergraduate or first-year graduate courses on microelectronics or VLSI devices. It will also be a valuable reference volume for practicing engineers involved in research and development in the electronics industry.
