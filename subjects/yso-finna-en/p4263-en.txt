Quo vadis Finnish army aviation?
China is the sixth most important trade partner of Finland, and Finland is China's largest  partner in Nordic region. Though ocean transportation still dominates the Finnish export to  China, air freight has shown the irreplaceable importance in consideration of speeding up delivery  to long-haul destinations, ensuring superior conditions of high value carriage, and cutting  inventory and storage costs for the customers. Not only led by this general trend but also  accompanied with a strong belief in a bright future for the two countries, air cargo carriers in  Finland are formulating their strategies to focus more on the China traffic. Lufthansa Cargo  AG (LCAG), as the second leading air carrier in Finland, also has been actively participating in  the competition.  The study is sponsored by LCAG to find out the opportunities for the company to increase  the market share of air freight traffic to China from Finland. In order to approach the main  research question, two secondary research questions were formulated as: what is the industry  structure of Finnish air freight market in respect to the China traffic, and what is the competitive  position of LCAG in this market. The research paid special attention to the scope of air  freight traffic flow from Finland to China.  Both primary and secondary data were employed to respond to the research questions. Depth  interviews with the industry experts, decision makers and most potential customers - air  freight forwarding agents - resulted in primary data. The major advantage of using depth interviews  for this particular research was that probing is effective in uncovering underlying or  hidden information, especially as the nature of the topic is complex. The period of data collection  was during the author's internship in LCAG from August 2008 to January 2009.  In conclusion, the research results reveal that air carriers in Finland are operating in an oligopoly  market structure concerning the China traffic. They are facing the shrinking demand, the  threats of the new entrants and substitutes, the increasing bargaining power from the buyer  due to the over capacity, and the fierce competition always there for them. Comparing to the  market leader, LCAG is regarded as charging higher rate but offering less perceived added  value services. However, the results of this study also indicate that LCAG does have opportunities  to increase its market share of the traffic to China in the terms of delivering consistent  high quality service, shortening the overall lead time, strengthening the cooperation with Chinese  partners, offering more value added services to improve the value of the rate charged,  tailoring forwarder management and establishing closer shipper contacts.
