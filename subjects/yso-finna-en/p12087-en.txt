Chondrites are the largest group of meteorites. They can provide unique insights into the origins and early evolution of our Solar System, and even into the relationships between our Solar System and other stars in the vicinity of our Sun. The largest structural components of most chondrites are the glass-bearing chondrules, and there are numerous theories for their origin. This clear and systematic text summarizes the ideas surrounding the origin and history of chondrules and chondrites, drawing on research from the various scientific disciplines involved. With citations to a large number of published papers on the topic, it forms a comprehensive bibliography of the key research areas, and extensive illustrations provide a clear visual representation of the scientific theories. This text will be a valuable reference for graduate students and researchers in planetary science, geology, and astronomy.
