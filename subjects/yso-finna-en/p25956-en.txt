Transformative learning and identity
A moral responsibility or an extra burden? : a study on global education as part of Finnish basic education
This text takes readers on a step-by-step journey through the history of reflective practice, from its origins with Donald Schon through to ideas of knowledge and power and how the counsellor or psychotherapist deals with issues surrounding the 'self'.

It will help adult educators understand what transformative learning is, distinguish it from other forms of learning, and foster it in their practice. The book covers five broad areas: historical, theoretical, practical, research, and future perspective. It is comprehensive, interdisciplinary, critical, reflective, and accessible to a wide audience of interested scholars, students, and practitioners. Co-edited by leading experts in the field with an advisory group of prominent authorities, this handbook is the leading resource for the field.
