The last of the Shor shamans
North America and Greenland : native languages
Stephen Leonard set off on a journey to document the language and spoken traditions of a small group of Inuit living in a remote corner of north-west Greenland - the Inugguit (the "big people"), who speak a complex language understood by few outsiders. Leonard lived with the Inugguit for 12 months, learning their language and living their way of life, where the traditional is juxtaposed with a modern consumerist lifestyle that has now made it to every corner of the planet. Some of the Inugguit may live in tiny, wind-beaten wooden cabins with no running water, but Amazon delivers. Affected directly by climate change, their quiet corner of the planet is melting. Their white, Arctic universe is about to become the centre of a geo-political battle over the remaining finite resources left on Earth, a place where polar bear fur clad Arctic hunters and their dog teams meet precious metal prospectors with satellite-based spectroscopes and hundreds of millions of dollars to spend.
