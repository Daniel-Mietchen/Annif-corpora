This paper is a summary report of a study on the soil fauna of Finland, supported by the Ministry of Environment, in the framework of the Finnish “PUTTE-Project” (Research Programme of Deficiently Known and Threatened Forest Species). The material was collected systematically from 15 different habitat types in eleven sampling areas with geographical coverage of the country...
