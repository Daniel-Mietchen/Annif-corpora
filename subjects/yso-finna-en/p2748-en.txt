The purpose of this thesis work was to research the bottlenecks in solar energy, to calculate energy payback time and to increase solar energy in Finland. This thesis was made as part of the Solarleap project, where Turku University of Applied Sciences and Satakunta University of Applied Sciences are partners together. This thesis is the first step on this project, and there will be more researches when the project goes forward. The theory part consists of solar energy and its effectiveness in Finland. The most common photovoltaic and thermal photovoltaic technologies are also presented. In the theory part, renewable energy sources and possibilities in Finland and also photovoltaics supply chain is discussed. The research part includes a discussion on the bottlenecks in solar energy, the investment costs of photovoltaic systems and the payback time of energy. Solar energy has lots of potential in Finland, but solar energy?s market share is small and the knowhow could be better. Also the energy payback time is bigger than in Europe.
