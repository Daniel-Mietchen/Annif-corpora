Finding new territories to expand a business is a common goal for many. Many markets are flooded with such a variety of products it is sometimes hard for an entering business to be noticed. Entering a virgin market that is not yet saturated with the mass companies is an ideal situation for a business. They would be new, fresh and desired. There are many countries that are considered to be up and coming economies. The factors in making these countries virtually untouched are many, some including poverty, crime, corruption and even terrorism. The objective of this thesis is to show Nigeria as a lucrative target market and to create a guide for entry. There are barriers to entry and fears of terrorism that keep many businesses away. In this work, it will unveil some of the people in Nigeria, lessening the mystery to this culture. The Nigerian culture is very business orientated and worldwide, business is business, and this is a common bond that foreign businesses have with their Nigerian counterparts. This thesis is written jointly with a Nigerian author and an American author, giving the knowledge of a native Nigerian as well as the questions of an outsider. The commissioners for this thesis are also used as the case companies. The first commissioner/case company is Vallila Interior, a Finnish interior design company and the focus will be on their brightly colored textiles. The second commissioner/case company will be Altretes Enterprises, a Nigerian interior design company wishing to import foreign textiles to meet their clientele’s demand. This thesis will be a guide on connecting the two companies and easing some fears the Finnish company might have about entering the Nigerian market.
"Functional Clothing Design introduces new ways to look at the human body, the environment, and clothing. It explores the ways design can achieve goals such as protecting the body, increasing health and safety, or increasing body function. Building on the groundbreaking text Clothing: The Portable Environment by co-author Susan M. Watkins, this text covers aspects of functional clothing design including: User-centered design for comfort and function in clothing; Clothing for thermal protection, impact protection, and hazardous environments; The design of wearable technology and other apparel solutions that enhance and augment body function; Commercial product development and the development of functional garmets and materials".

"This user-friendly guide to evaluating apparel quality presents the roles of product designers, manufacturers, merchandisers, testing laboratories, and retailers from product inception through the sale of goods, to ensure quality products that meet customer expectations. Bubonia provides an overview of apparel production, with emphasis on quality characteristics and cues, consumer influences and motivations impacting purchasing decisions, and the relationship of apparel manufacturing and production processes, cost, price point and the quality level of an apparel product. A key aspect of the book is the focus on both U.S. and international standards and regulations required for apparel analysis, performance, labeling requirements and safety regulations. Heavily illustrated with images of stitch and seam types plus photos of their uses in actual garments, students will have the tools needed to skillfully evaluate and critique quality elements in apparel and textile products"--
