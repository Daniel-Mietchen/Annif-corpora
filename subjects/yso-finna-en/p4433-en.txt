This Bachelor’s thesis was done as a private project with objectives to propose and describe an idea for a web application. The proposed application enables students in developing countries to prepare better for exams, acting as a collective platform for exam preparation related activities. Another objective of this thesis was to gain practical knowledge of web application development and related technologies by developing a prototype web application for the proposed idea. Ruby and Rails web framework was used to develop the prototype. The reasons to opt Ruby and Rails for development were its open source nature, popularity and my keen interest in learning the framework. Front-end framework Bootstrap 3.0, online drawing tool Google Drawing and other technologies associated with the web application development were used to describe the idea and to build the prototype application. Question paper browsing, reading, subscribing and answering components were fully developed in the prototype application along with very basic social networking features such as, posting micro-post and following other users. Being a prototype, the developed web application has potential for further development. Features, such as web accessibility, responsive design, social network integration, push notification service, and PDF file generation can be added to extend the application.
