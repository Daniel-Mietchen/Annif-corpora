The acquisition of early reading skills : the influence of the home environment in Lusaka, Zambia
Starting school is seen as a significant event in childhood not only by parents and teachers, but by children themselves. Although it seems clear that gender identities have been firmly developed in domestic settings, we also know that school has a major influence on further development as evidenced by achievements and choices of subjects in later educational careers. How do children come to negotiate such a social gender identity? Gerard Duveen and Barbara Lloyd examine the beginnings of this process through an investigation of four- and five-year-old children's reconstruction of gender during their first year at school. Their research is informed by the theory of social representations, and their approach combines the psychology of development with that of social gender identities.

Publisher's description: On Reading Books to Children: Parents and Teachers brings together in one volume current research on adult book reading to children. The authors, drawn from around the world, are key researchers and eminent scholars from the fields of reading and literacy, child language, speech pathology, and psychology, representing multiple perspectives within these disciplines. Chapters on the effects and limitations of book sharing are integrated with chapters discussing promising programs on storybook research. The reality of reading to children is more complex than it appears on the surface. The authors discuss some effects of and suggestions for reading to children that have emerged from the research. The ideas set forth in this volume will stimulate new lines of research on the effects of storybook reading, as well as refinements of current methods, yielding findings that enrich our understanding of this important arena of literacy development.
