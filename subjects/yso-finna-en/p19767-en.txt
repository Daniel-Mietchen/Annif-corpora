From social media to the Internet of Things, digital fabrication to robotics, virtual reality to synthetic biology, new technologies are racing forward across the board. Together they are ripping up the rule book for people, firms, and governments alike. Mastering this so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is the theme of the World Economic Forumâ€™s 2016 Annual Meeting, for which this special collection serves as background reading. Klaus Schwab kicks things off with an overview of the topic, followed by sections on the technological trends driving the revolution; those trends' economic, social, and political impacts; and the resulting challenges for policy. Drawn from the pages of Foreign Affairs and the pixels of ForeignAffairs.com, the articles feature world-class experts explaining crucial issues clearly, directly, and authoritatively. We hope you enjoy the collection and come back for more.

"Sustainable Business: Key Issues is the first comprehensive introductory-level textbook to address the interface between environmental challenges and business solutions to provide an overview of the basic concepts of sustainability, sustainable business, and business ethics. The book introduces students to the background and key issues of sustainability and suggests ways in which these concepts can be applied in business practice. Though the book takes a business perspective, it is interdisciplinary in its nature and draws on knowledge from socio-economic, political, and environmental studies, thereby providing a practical and critical understanding of sustainability in the changing paradigm of global business. It goes beyond the conventional theories of sustainability and addresses critical issues concerned with population, consumption and economic growth. It discusses realistic ways forward, in particular the Circular Economy and Cradle to Cradle frameworks.The book is both a theoretical and practical study guide for undergraduate and postgraduate international students of broad areas of sustainability, teaching ways to recognize opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship at the intersection of environmental, economic, ethical, and social systems. It takes a strategic approach in applying the power of business methods and policy to address issues of global importance such as climate change, poverty, ecosystem degradation and human rights.This textbook is essential reading for students of business, management and sustainability courses. It is written in an engaging and accessible style, with each chapter including case studies, discussion questions, end of chapter summaries and suggestions for further reading"--

Corporate social responsibility is becoming more and more current issue and some sort of a hot topic in the business world. Companies are putting more effort into their own responsible activities than they did before and at the same time the public awareness of responsibilities of companies is growing. This thesis focuses on the tools for managing corporate social responsibility. The aim is to find out what kind of tools there are, which are the most suitable for the needs of small and medium enterprises and also to clarify the basic concepts and contents of CSR. This thesis is a qualitative research and interviews were used as the research method. Information about the CSR tools were gathered based on the interviews and also the selection criteria for the right tools for SMEs was drafted. The results show that the selection of tools is quite large. There are CSR tools for various purposes. Some are only for reporting CSR, some are designed to help companies in their environmental issues and some offer advice in the financial aspects of business. The conclusions state that only few of tools introduced are suitable for SMEs with little to no changes made to the principles of the tools. Most of the tools are developed for the purposes of bigger enterprises and without any changes they would require a lot of resources from an SME to be implemented properly.
