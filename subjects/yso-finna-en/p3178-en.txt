This textbook is intended for those studying A-levels, diplomas or undergraduate programs that focus on textiles and fashion. It provides a clear and systematic approach to the fundamentals of topics such as textile fibres, fabric manufacture, textile dyeing, apparel design and manufacture. Developments such as environmental and sustainability, smart textiles and the integration of technology into the textile and fashion industry are also discussed. Case studies are incorporated to demonstrate practical aspects of the topic. Each chapter includes a summary to emphasise the key points and a comprehensive self-review section for the student.
