This publication aims to provide a source of inspiration for students, designers and companies, and all stakeholders whose interest lies in the area of sustainable fashion. The book presents approaches to fashion that embrace future-oriented value. Several chapters illustrate how effective fashion can be as transformative design or change agent experimentation. A sustainable approach can also reframe current business thinking and reveal opportunities for innovative business strategies. Sustainable Fashion proposes how we can make positive change in current practices and how to effect new mindsets, creating transformation in fashion.

Designers and artists have always looked to nature for inspiration and materials, but only recently have they been able to alter and incorporate living organisms in their work. In a world with finite resources and a growing population, design that mimics or appropriates the sustainable template of nature is likely to prove as vital as it is novel. 'Bio Design' examines some seventy projects (concepts, prototypes and completed designs) that cover the fields of architecture, industrial processes, education, fine art, material engineering and bioengineering. Each project is illustrated by a short text, images and captions that combine to explain the problems the venture tackles, and how living materials and processes were harnessed to solve them in sustainable and aesthetically pleasing ways. Many of the solutions also provoke thought about manipulating life for human ends.
