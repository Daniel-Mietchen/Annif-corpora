Women's health
The book recounts the events and changes that have taken place over many centuries in society: changes in scientific knowledge and the way it is communicated, changes in technology, and changes in the lives and times of those who have dedicated their efforts to the health of women and their progeny. Covering developments in seemingly unrelated fields, the book illustrates how they were vital to advances in gynaecology and obstetrics. This multi-faceted approach, chronological tables, and reviews of related subjects and technologies, provides a rich treatment than would be possible if the authors had written from a century-by-century perspective. With narrative that engages and draws you along page after page, History of Obstetrics and Gynaecology puts the achievements of the last millennium in perspective.
