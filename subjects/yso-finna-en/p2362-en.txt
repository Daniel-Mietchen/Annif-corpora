Abstract: Two observations of birds nestin in snow are reported. In northern finland a Capercaillie, Tetrao urogallus, and in western Finland an Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo, laid their eggs in the snow. All nine eggs laid by the Capercaillie hatched. The melting of the snow destroyed the Eagle Owls nest...
Synchrony in tetraonid population dynamics
There are two native subspecies of the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo in Europe: the mainly coastal nominate subspecies carbo, and the mainly continental subspecies sinensis. The population of the latter, in particular, has increased significantly in recent decades. Old literature records suggest that cormorants of some kind were breeding at the largest freshwater lake in Europe, Lake Ladoga, in the early part of the 20th century. A couple of specimens from this population were allegedly also collected; however, the current whereabouts of these specimens appear to be unknown. Recent studies have shown that both cormorant subspecies are ecologically fairly flexible and, therefore, breeding at a freshwater locality cannot by itself be regarded as evidence that they belonged to the continental subspecies sinensis. Thus, it is not possible to ascertain with certainty to which subspecies Lake Ladoga's cormorants belonged..
