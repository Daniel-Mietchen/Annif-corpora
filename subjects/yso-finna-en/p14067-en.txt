This research monograph investigates how 'finite-dimensional' sets can be embedded into finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The first part brings together a number of abstract embedding results, and provides a unified treatment of four definitions of dimension that arise in disparate fields: Lebesgue covering dimension (from classical 'dimension theory'), Hausdorff dimension (from geometric measure theory), upper box-counting dimension (from dynamical systems), and Assouad dimension (from the theory of metric spaces). These abstract embedding results are applied in the second part of the book to the finite-dimensional global attractors that arise in certain infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, deducing practical consequences from the existence of such attractors: a version of the Takens time-delay embedding theorem valid in spatially extended systems, and a result on parametrisation by point values.
"Topology is a large subject with many branches broadly categorized as algebraic topology, point-set topology, and geometric topology. Point-set topology is the main language for a broad variety of mathematical disciplines. Algebraic topology serves as a powerful tool for studying the problems in geometry and numerous other areas of mathematics. Elements of Topology provides a basic introduction to point-set topology and algebraic topology. It is intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students with working knowledge of analysis and algebra. Topics discussed include the theory of convergence, function spaces, topological transformation groups, fundamental groups, and covering spaces.The author makes the subject accessible by providing more than 250 worked examples and counterexamples with applications. The text also includes numerous end-of-section exercises to put the material into context"--

In the fifth of his famous list of 23 problems, Hilbert asked if every topological group which was locally Euclidean was in fact a Lie group. Through the work of Gleason, Montgomery-Zippin, Yamabe, and others, this question was solved affirmatively; more generally, a satisfactory description of the (mesoscopic) structure of locally compact groups was established. Subsequently, this structure theory was used to prove Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, and more recently in the work of Hrushovski, Breuillard, Green, and the author on the structure of approximate groups.

"The book is the first systematic research completely devoted to a comprehensive study of virtual knots and classical knots as its integral part. The book is self-contained and contains up-to-date exposition of the key aspects of virtual (and classical) knot theory. Virtual knots were discovered by Louis Kauffman in 1996. When virtual knot theory arose, it became clear that classical knot theory was a small integral part of a larger theory, and studying properties of virtual knots helped one understand better some aspects of classical knot theory and encouraged the study of further problems. Virtual knot theory finds its applications in classical knot theory. Virtual knot theory occupies an intermediate position between the theory of knots in arbitrary three-manifold and classical knot theory. In this book we present the latest achievements in virtual knot theory including Khovanov homology theory and parity theory due to V O Manturov and graph-link theory due to both authors. By means of parity, one can construct functorial mappings from knots to knots, filtrations on the space of knots, refine many invariants and prove minimality of many series of knot diagrams. Graph-links can be treated as "diagramless knot theory": such "links" have crossings, but they do not have arcs connecting these crossings. It turns out, however, that to graph-links one can extend many methods of classical and virtual knot theories, in particular, the Khovanov homology and the parity theory."--Publisher's website.

People who teach university-level mathematics for a living often find themselves reading lots of books on the subject. For some of us, this can often be quite pleasant â€” why else would anybody choose to review books for the MAA? But even for the book-lovers among us, after youâ€™ve just read about ten linear algebra texts, all of which look like they were stamped from the same cookie cutter, the process can occasionally wear thin. Itâ€™s very pleasant, then, to stumble across a book that is genuinely unique, that addresses a topic in a way not found elsewhere, and that teaches you something that you didnâ€™t know before. Itâ€™s even nicer when the book in question does a really good job of it, as is the case with the book under review. Winding Around is written by John Roe, author of the excellent Elementary Geometry, a book that I have always thought is not as well known as it deserves to be. This time around, the author again discusses some geometry, but also throws in topology, complex analysis, and abstract algebra. The unifying concept that links all these ideas is that of the winding number. Prior to looking at this book, I had at least heard of the winding number, but I must confess that it was something of a hazy memory. I first ran across the term in an undergraduate course in complex variables, where it was defined as an integral, proved to be an integer, and invoked in such things as the Cauchy Integral Formula and Cauchy Residue Theorem. Over the years I may have encountered the term again as I flipped through books on complex analysis, but that seems to have been the extent of my dealings with the concept. I certainly did not realize, until seeing this book, that the idea of the winding number could be applied profitably in other areas of mathematics. This book starts, after some preliminary motivational material, with a chapter discussing homotopic maps. This is in preparation for a chapter that give...
