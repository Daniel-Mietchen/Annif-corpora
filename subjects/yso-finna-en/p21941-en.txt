Sequester or harvest : the optimal use of managed forests to mitigate climate change
This text offers a thorough, state-of-the-art examination of the science of carbon sequestration in forests, the management of forests for carbon and other values and the socio-economic and policy implications and challenges of managing forests for carbon.
"Frames forestry activities within climate-change policy context. Analyzes the operation and efficacy of market-based mechanisms for forest conservation and climate change. Explores voluntary schemes for carbon crediting, provides an overview of carbon accounting best practices, and presents tools for future sequestration and offset programs. Concludes with options for slowing deforestation"--Provided by publisher.

"Boreal ecosystems contain one-third of the world's forests and stored carbon, but these regions are under increasing threat from both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Written by leaders from the forefront of private, public and academic sectors Reclamation and restoration of boreal ecosystems emphasizes a broad, conceptual approach to the specific application of empirical research into development planning, restoration and modelling of these ecosystems, the importance of which is highlighted at a time of global climate change as they act as carbon sinks. There is a focus on the reclamation of exploited ecosystems from a holistic standpoint, ranging from environmental and edaphic variables to the restoration of keystone flora. Recent advances in quantification of ecosystem services, such as habitat suitability and carbon storage modelling are also detailed. The book contains case-studies which address how both historical and novel assemblages can provide ecosystem stability under projected climatic and land-use scenarios".
