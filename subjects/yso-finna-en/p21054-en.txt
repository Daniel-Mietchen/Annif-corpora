Ecology of industrial pollution
Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.

"Written primarily as a textbook for upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, this book provides fundamental knowledge concerning the biological and health effects of pollutants on living systems. Also able to serve as a reference for professionals, the book stresses the chemical and biological characteristics of major pollutants found in the air, water, and soil, and their impacts on the health and wellbeing of humans, animals, and plants. This new edition is greatly expanded and updated, includes a color insert, and contains a new chapter on Occupational Toxicology"--Provided by publisher.

Skimmers are known to be one of the most efficient tool that are normally employed in effective oil clean-up and recovery operation as well as during treatment of waste water before a final discharge into the environment.  There are lots of factors that determine the recovery rates of most skimmers especially when certain oil types are involved. In this piece, I will be writing about the use of skimmers, how it works, how the specification and design of skimmers enhances its oil recovery abilities and its general advantage over host of other equipments. My source of writing will be solely based on scientific journals, textbooks, articles and internet sources which deal indepthly with the topic in question.

"Written for researchers and practitioners in environmental pollution, management and ecology, this interdisciplinary account explores the ecological issues associated with industrial pollution to provide a complete picture of this important environmental problem from cause to effect to solution. Bringing together diverse viewpoints from academia and environmental agencies and regulators, the contributors cover such topics as biological resources of mining areas, biomonitoring of freshwater and marine ecosystems and risk assessment of contaminated land in order to explore important questions such as: What are the effects of pollutants on functional ecology and ecosystems? Do current monitoring techniques accurately signal the extent of industrial pollution? Does existing policy provide a coherent and practicable approach? Case studies from throughout the world illustrate major themes and provide valuable insights into the positive and negative effects of industrial pollution, the provision of appropriate monitoring schemes and the design of remediation and restoration strategies."--NHBS Environment Bookstore.

Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

Microplastic Pollutants introduces the reader to the growing problem of microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment and is the first ever book dedicated exclusively to the subject of microplastics. Importantly, this timely full-colour illustrated multidisciplinary book highlights the very recent realization that microplastics may transport toxic chemicals into food chains around the world. Microplastic pollutants is currently an important topic in both industry and academia, as well as among legislative bodies, and research in this area is gaining considerable attention from both the worldwide media and scientific community on a rapidly increasing scale. Ultimately, this book provides an excellent source of reference and information on microplastics for scientists, engineers, students, industry, policy makers and citizens alike.

This study aimed to assess the ecological status of three urban ponds in the Tampere region by analysing their present condition in reference to previously conducted research as well as other reference criteria.  The main pond of interest was Sorsalampi, as it is presently in the focus of city development plans. The ecological condition of Hautalammi and Vaakkolammi was of interest as reference conditions and was determined simultaneously. The ponds were analysed during autumn/winter of 2009/10. The studied parameters include physiochemical elements, the nutrient level, as well as biological elements and sediment properties. The results of this study are in accordance with previously obtained results indicating that all three ponds are affected by urban and/or industrial pollution and are to a certain extent eutrophicated. According to the criteria of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union, the ecological status of Sorsalampi was estimated between “poor” and “bad”, whereas the status of Vaakkolammi was classified as “poor”. Hautalammi could not be classified.
