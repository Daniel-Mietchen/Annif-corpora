Long term use of continuous positive airway pressure care in sleep apnea : literature review on common side effects and possible nursing interventions
"The approach to anesthesia in children poses specific challenges such as acute emotional fear and distress, fluid imbalances, greater risks for dangerous upper respiratory infections, and most importantly, dosing requirements. The guest editors on this issue are the leaders in this field and will collect the best contributors to address new research advances in perioperative and postoperative scenarios, as well as offering best practices for common pediatric procedures." -- (Elsevier)
