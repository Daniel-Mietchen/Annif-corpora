Chemical plant growth retardants (PGR's) are widely used to decrease plant height and increase quality in commercial bedding plant production. Spraying is most used application method. Usually it has to be given in  certain stage of plant development and it has to be repeated. After the  spraying working in the greenhouse is not allowed. Giving the recommendation of PGR-use in concentration is a common  way. It gives a lot of space for variation of actual amount of PGR that a plant absorbs. Effect of the amount of absorbed PGR-solution was a main  question of this study. Liner dip is an application method, which could solve many of the  disadvantages of the spray-applications. It is pretransplant method: One  dipping of young plant plugs to the PGR solution before transplanting to cultivation pots is enough.  Usability of the method in the cultivation of seed propagated plants or  usability of other chemicals than triazoles, has not been studied earlier. In this study the crop was seed propagated petunia and chemicals tested were  plant growth retardant flurprimidol (product name Topflor) and  propiconazole (Tilt), a fungicide from triazoles -group. According the results of this study, actual amount of absorbed PGRchemical  is more important than the concentration of the given PGR-solution. The application method is suitable also for the seed propagated  plants and flurprimidol acts very well as PGR with the liner dip method.  On the ground of this study, propiconazole is not a suitable chemical for  the method.

The latest techniques for propagating crops with terminal, stem, and leaf/stem cuttings are the focus of this horticulture handbook. All the bases are covered - propagation basics, stock plant management, media, temperature, light, nutrition, plant growth regulators, insect and disease management, equipment, and postharvest handling. From these general subjects, the editors focus in on specifics for scores of specialty bedding plants, perennials, specialty cut flowers, and foliage plants. Then they zoom in even closer, covering more than 60 important floriculture crops in detail so propagators and growers can provide high-quality cuttings and young plants to the market.

"Heterocycles in Life and Society is an introduction to the chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, focusing on their origin and occurrence in nature, biochemical significance and wide range of applications. Written in a readable and accessible style, the book takes a multidisciplinary approach to this extremely important area of organic chemistry. Topics covered include an introduction to the structure and properties of heterocycles; the key role of heterocycles in important life processes such as the transfer of hereditary information, how enzymes function, the storage and transport of bioenergy, and photosynthesis; applications of heterocycles in medicine, agriculture and industry; heterocycles in supramolecular chemistry; the origin of heterocycles on primordial Earth; and how heterocycles can help us solve 21st century challenges. For this second edition, Heterocycles in Life and Society has been completely revised and expanded, drawing on a decade of innovation in heterocyclic chemistry. The new edition includes discussions of the role of heterocycles in nanochemistry, green chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, molecular devices and sensors, and supramolecular chemistry. Impressive achievements include the creation of various molecular devices, the recording and storage of information, the preparation of new organic conductors, and new effective drugs and pesticides with heterocyclic structures. Much new light has been thrown on various life processes, while the chemistry of heterocycles has expanded to include new types of heterocyclic structures and reactions, and the use of heterocyclic molecules as ionic liquids and proton sponges. Heterocycles in Life and Society is an essential guide to this important field for students and researchers in chemistry, biochemistry, and drug discovery, and scientists at all levels wishing to expand their scientific horizon."--

Turkey is one of the biggest cotton producing countries in the world. Defoliant is applied on 17% of the Turkey cotton production, which is similar to average defoliant application in the world. In Turkey, Finish速 and Dropp速 are widely in use as defoliant for desired boll opening in cotton. Finish速 contains ethephon a.i. and cyclanilide a.i., and Dropp速 contains thidiazuron a.i. and diuron a.i. In this study, total risk of defoliant on human health and environment were calculated by POCER (The Pesticide Occupational and Environmental Risk) indicator. The objective of this study was to determine the total risk value of defoliant application in cotton on human health and environment in Turkey. Thidiazuron a.i. has no potential risk on human health and environment. Diuron a.i. has relatively low total risk value on human health. Yet, it has very low risk on environment (0.097). Ethephon a.i. has relatively high total risk on human health (1.550). Cyclanilide a.i. has total risk on human health similar to ethephon a.i. These active ingredients (a.i.) have no potential risk for environment. Consequently, defoliant application in cotton has very low total risk value due to 10 of maximum value.
