Practical dispersion : a guide to understanding and formulating slurries
This volume offers a comprehensive guide on the theory and practice of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) for handling challenges associated with poorly soluble drugs. In twenty-three inclusive chapters, the book examines thermodynamics and kinetics of the amorphous state and amorphous solid dispersions, ASD technologies, excipients for stabilizing amorphous solid dispersions such as polymers, and ASD manufacturing technologies, including spray drying, hot melt extrusion, fluid bed layering and solvent-controlled micro-precipitation technology (MBP). Each technology is illustrated by specific case studies. In addition, dedicated sections cover analytical tools and technologies for characterization of amorphous solid dispersions, the prediction of long-term stability, and the development of suitable dissolution methods and regulatory aspects. The book also highlights future technologies on the horizon, such as supercritical fluid processing, mesoporous silica, KinetiSol℗ʼ, and the use of non-salt-forming organic acids and amino acids for the stabilization of amorphous systems. Amorphous Solid Dispersions: Theory and Practice is a valuable reference to pharmaceutical scientists interested in developing bioavailable and therapeutically effective formulations of poorly soluble molecules in order to advance these technologies and develop better medicines for the future.℗

Using classical and quantum methods with a strong emphasis on symmetry principles, this book, a reissue of the 2004 second edition, develops the theory of a variety of optical activity and related phenomena from the perspective of molecular scattering of polarised light. In addition to the traditional topic of optical rotation and circular dichroism in the visible and near-ultraviolet associated with electronic transitions, the newer topic of optical activity associated with vibrational transitions, which may be studied using both infrared and Raman techniques, is also treated. Ranging from the physics of elementary particles to the structure of viruses, the subject matter of the book reflects the importance of optical activity and chirality in much of modern science and will be of interest to a wide range of physical and life scientists.
