"Hospital-Based Palliative Medicine: A Practical, Evidence-Based Approach focuses on improving a Hospitalist's ability to provide quality palliative care in the inpatient hospital setting. Although several large textbooks exist for the palliative care provider, there are few detailed resources aimed specifically at the general Hospitalist and hospital-based staff. Existing textbooks dedicate at most only one chapter to palliative care and they lack the detail and specificity in symptom management and communication skills to truly guide care. Hospital-Based Palliative Medicine addresses each of the major components involved in the delivery of inpatient palliative care. These include the management of complex symptoms and the use of specific communication techniques - right down to the actual words to say to the patient - to convey important information such as the reason for and use of medication and how to handle difficult topics with patients and their families and caregivers. The book's authors are all leaders in the field of palliative care, and most of them also practice as hospitalists, and thus understand both perspectives. Chapters are presented in a consistent format with particular attention to both clinical pearls and pitfalls, making the material practical and easily accessible to the busy hospitalist and associated hospital staff"--Provided by publisher.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases affect many people in Finland. One way to support this patient group is patient education. Since the time spent in the inpatient settings is limited, treatment and education of cardiovascular patients is currently focused mainly on the outpatient settings. This creates pressure for the nurses due to the strict time-frame and high turnover of patients. The purpose of this final project was to find evidence-based knowledge on the patient education of a cardiac patient and to implement a nursing journal club. The research questions were when and how the education for heart patients should be conducted. This final project was done in co-operation with the cardiac outpatient clinic in the University Hospital of Helsinki where the collected knowledge was presented in four journal club sessions. Data collection was done following the basics of literature review and by conducting multiple database searches. A more in-depth analysis was conducted once five most relevant articles were found. These five articles were presented to the nursing staff of cardiac outpatient clinic in Meilahti during May 2011. The issues presented in the nursing journal clubs were focused on the learning needs of cardiac patients, different kinds of patient education methods and the psychological path-way of a patient suffering from a cardiovascular illness. The focus was on going through the results of each article and discussing them together with the nurses. Based on the discussion, it became clear that most crucial points that rose from the articles chosen were taking patient's individual needs into consideration and the importance of consistent planning and documenting care.

"Evidence-based care is a well established principle in contemporary healthcare and a worldwide health care movement. However, despite the emphasis on promoting evidence-based or effective care without the unnecessary use of technologies and drugs, intervention rates in childbirth continue to rise rapidly. This new edition emphasises the importance of translating evidence into skilful practice. It updates the evidence around what works best for normal birth, aspects of which still remain hidden and ignored by some maternity care professionals. Beginning with the decision about where to have a baby, through all the phases of labour to the immediate post-birth period, it systematically details research and other evidence sources that endorse a low intervention approach. The second edition: - has been expanded with new chapters on Preparation for Childbirth and Waterbirth - highlights where the evidence is compelling - discusses its application where women question its relevance to them and where the practitioner's expertise leads them to challenge it - gives background and context before discussing the research to date - includes questions for reflection, skills sections and practice recommendations generated from the evidence. Using evidence drawn from a variety of sources, Evidence and Skills for Normal Labour and Birth critiques institutionalised, scientifically managed birth and endorses a more humane midwifery-led model. Packed with up-to-date and relevant information, this text will help all students, practising midwives and doulas keep abreast of the evidence surrounding normal birth and ensure their practice takes full advantage of it"--Provided by publisher.

"The knowledge and skills of critical thinking, evidence-based practice, problem solving, judgment, and decision making are essential to effectively serve clients in all types of clinical practices. This book teaches clinicians and students how to avoid fallacies and biases in thinking as well as the skills to make well-informed, ethical decisions. Grounded in the belief that clinical decision making is a challenging process that can be improved by honing the skills integral to evidence-based practice, this book explores common sources of error and provides psychologists, counselors, social workers, and allied health professionals practical guidance with decision aids and applications of critical thinking skills to clinical decision making"--Provided by publisher.
