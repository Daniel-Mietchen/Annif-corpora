This volume focuses on the architectural form of the portico as it was implemented, modified and experienced in the three regions of Gaul known as Narbonensis, Aquitania and Lugdunensis. It maps the chronological spread of the portico, and analyses the siting of these features in the landscape. Frakes sees the portico as a symbol of Roman Imperial power, but one which local elites could but into, placing their own images alonside the imperial ones in its spatial cells. As such it can be seen as an important tool in tracing the modalities of Romanization, and particular care is taken in exploring the diversity of portico types and decoration to be found, particularly outside of the major fora. Finally Frakes examines the end of portico construction towards the end of the 3rd centuries BC and asks why this architectural component fell from favour. Contains a detailed catalogue of porticoes excavated in the region.
