environmental attitudes
The health of the planet survey : a preliminary report on attitudes on the environment and economic growth measured by surveys of citizens in 22 nations to date
"This book brings together a collection of highly-respected contributors to provide a global history of environmentalism. It makes the basic assumption that we can better understand the relationship that exists between man and nature through the close observation of conflicts that have taken place between the two. Using a range of case studies, A History of Environmentalism: Local Struggles, Global Histories weaves together an intricate fabric of environmental struggles throughout history that tells us much about transformations of cultural perceptions and ways of production and consuming, as well as ecological and social changes. Although the narratives included in the book are strongly rooted in specific places, including Brazil, Italy, the USA and Australia, they suggest and reveal things about environmental issues in history on a world scale. This book will enable students to understand the history of environmentalism from a global and local perspective simultaneously"--

"Most of us recognize that climate change is real, and yet we do nothing to stop it. What is this psychological mechanism that allows us to know something is true but act as if it is not? George Marshall's search for the answers brings him face-to-face with Nobel Prize-winning psychologists and the activists of the Texas Tea Party; the world's leading climate scientists and the people who denounce them; liberal environmentalists and conservative evangelicals. What he discovers is that our values, assumptions, and prejudices can take on lives of their own, gaining authority as they are shared, dividing people in their wake. With engaging stories and drawing on years of his own research, Marshall argues that the answers do not lie in the things that make us different and drive us apart, but rather in what we all share: how our human brains are wired--our evolutionary origins, our perceptions of threats, our cognitive blind spots, our love of storytelling, our fear of death, and our deepest instincts to defend our family and tribe. Once we understand what excites, threatens, and motivates us, we can rethink and reimagine climate change, for it is not an impossible problem. In the end, Don't even think about it is both about climate change and about the qualities that make us human and how we can grow as we deal with the greatest challenge we have ever faced."--

"Children growing up today are confronted by four difficult and intersecting challenges: dangerous environmental change, weakening democracies, growing social inequality, and a global economy marked by unprecedented youth unemployment and unsustainable resource extraction. Yet on streets everywhere, there is also a strong, youthful energy for change.This book sets out an inspiring new agenda for citizenship and environmental education which reflects the responsibility and opportunities facing educators, researchers, parents and community groups to support young citizens as they learn to 'make a difference' on the issues that concern them. Controversial yet ultimately hopeful, political scientist Bronwyn Hayward rethinks assumptions about youth citizenship in neoliberal democracies.Her comparative discussion with the US and UK draws on lessons from New Zealand, a country where young citizens often express a strong sense of personal responsibility for their planet but where many children also face shocking social conditions. Hayward develops a 'SEEDS' model of ecological citizenship education (Social agency, Environmental Education, Embedded justice, Decentred deliberative democracy and Self transcendence). The discussion considers how the SEEDs model can support young citizens' democratic imagination and develop their 'handprint' for social justice.From eco-worriers and citizen-scientists to streetwise sceptics, "Children, Citizenship and Environment" identifies a variety of forms of citizenship and discusses why many approaches make it more difficult, not easier, for young citizens to effect change.This book will be of interest to a wide audience, in particular teachers of children aged 8-12 and professionals who work in Environmental Citizenship Education as well as students and researchers with an interest in environmental change, democracy and intergenerational justice.Introduced by international sustainability expert Tim Jackson, the book includes forewords by leading European and USA academics, Andrew Dobson and Roger Hart.Half the author's royalties will be donated to child poverty projects following the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand.Follow Bronwyn Hayward's blog at: http://growing-greens.blogspot.co.nz/<BR>"--Provided by publisher.

The purpose of this thesis is to offer up to date information on the international students’ knowledge and attitude towards sustainable development in Oulu University of Applied Sciences. This thesis was commissioned by the Oulu University of Applied Sciences Sustainable Development Team. Similar study was conducted with the Finnish students in 2011. The research task was done in two parts. First the survey questions were translated to English and a few questions were added to gather more background information on the respondents. The primary research included data collection with an online survey, analysis and summary. The online survey was sent to all the students in English speaking degree programmes. The main conclusions from the survey were that the international students had good basic knowledge in sustainable development. Overall the students’ attitudes towards sustainable development were positive. Students felt that sustainable development issues are handled well in the schools everyday operations and that sustainable development teaching should be more practical.
Hot topic - cold comfort : climate change and attitude change
This book does not set out once more to raise the alarm to encourage us to take radical measures to head off climate chaos. There have been any number of books and reports in recent years explaining just how dire the future looks and how little time we have left to act. This book is about why we have ignored those warnings, and why it is now too late. It is a book about the frailties of the human species as expressed in both the institutions we built and the psychological dispositions that have led us on the path of self-destruction. It is about our strange obsessions, our hubris, and our penc

"Today's millennial generation inherit a world confronted by four difficult and intersecting challenges: dangerous environmental change, weakening democracies, growing social inequality, and a paradigm of economic growth that has contributed to unprecedented youth unemployment and resource extraction beyond our planet's limits. But the future is not inevitable and today on the streets everywhere; there is a strong, youthful energy for change. 'Children, Citizenship and Environment' sets out a new agenda for citizenship education which reflects both the responsibility and opportunities we are confronted with to support young citizens. In a myth busting discussion of issues facing young citizens growing up in neoliberal democracies, political scientist Bronwyn Hayward draws on the experience of New Zealanders, a nation where young citizens often express a strong sense of personal responsibility for their planet but where many face shocking social conditions. Theoretically informed and written with engaging practical insight, Hayward argues that young citizens today will need fewer lessons in how to recycle or when to switch off the lights and more intergenerational support to reclaim their democratic imagination and discover the 'seeds' of ecological citizenship and their own SMART ' handprint' for social justice. This book will be of interest to a wide audience including teachers in the Education sector, students and researchers, as well as policy makers and N.G.Os who work in the area of Youth Citizenship"--Provided by publisher.
