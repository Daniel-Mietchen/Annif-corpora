This volume examines the use of desalination processes to aid in the conservation of historic buildings and artifacts. The papers contained in this volume examine the salt transport mechanisms between a salt laden substrate and a material applied to its surface; improved methods for assessing desalination treatments and the assessment of the working principle and efficiency of salt extraction poultice systems for use on wall surfaces in monumental buildings by using non-destructive analysis on different material substrates and under different environmental conditions; the results of laboratory tests to evaluate the workability and mechanical properties of fresh poultices; and the assessment of the moisture and ion transport mechanisms active during desalination in different poultice/substrate combinations, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance.

Man and stone
Brick and stone have been used in architecture for a centuries and are favoured by architects for their unique properties. In recent years, with the development of new technologies, the variety of brick and stone materials has been greatly extended. This superbly illustrated book discusses masonry in two sections addressing brick and stone respectively, and goes further into detailed classification. The projects are elaborately selected and analysed, each presented with photos, drawings and narratives. Also included is a summary of the current state and future of the application of brick and stone in architecture, providing readers with a new understanding of masonry in the 21st century.
