Family relations
"Examining novels, trial transcripts, medico-legal documents, broadsides, criminal and scientific writing, illustration and, notably, Victorian melodrama, Bridget Walsh focuses on the relationship between the domestic sphere, so central to Victorian values, and the desecration of that space by the act of murder. Her book tackles crucial questions related to Victorian ideas of nationhood, national health, inequality, newspaper coverage of murder, contested models of masculinity, and the portrayal of the female domestic murderer at the fin de sieÌ€cle"--
