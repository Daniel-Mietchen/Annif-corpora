# Wikidata training corpus

This directory is intended as a place for (English language) corpus files
that use Wikidata as the subject vocabulary.

The assumption is that these will be created by taking an existing
bibliographic data set and converting the references to the subject
vocabulary to corresponding Wikidata URIs using mappings defined between the
subject vocabulary and Wikidata.

Please contribute TSV files in [Annif short text corpus
format](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Document-corpus-formats#short-text-document-corpus-tsv-file)
(gzip compressed if they are large) using pull requests.
