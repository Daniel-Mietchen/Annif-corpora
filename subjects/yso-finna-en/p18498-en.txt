Shan Tao Yun is an exiled Chinese national, a former Beijing investigator on parole from the Tibetan work camp to which he had been consigned as punishment. While there he was befriended by unlicensed Tibetan lamas with whom he has been living, since his release, in a secret monastery." "Now he is summoned to a remote village to save a comatose man from summary execution for two murders. The victims' arms had been severed and borne away. Why?" "Shan discovers that the unconscious suspect is not Tibetan, as had been assumed, but Navajo, and that the recent murders are only part of a chain of deaths. Suspects include a prominent Chinese scientist and his would-be criminologist nephew, as well as the village headman, and the illegal miners who are camped nearby. Together with his friends, the unlicensed monks Gendun and Lokesh, Shan must solve the riddle of Dragon Mountain, the place "where world begins.

There are many parallels and some revealing differences in the encounter between, on the one hand, the Americans and various Indian tribes and, on the other, the Russians and some of the peoples of the Caucasus and Siberia. The enduring cultural consequences of these encounters provide a fruitful area of inquiry for the comparative examination of national images in literatures. The major focus on this study is the perceptions and literary portrayal of the Chechens by the Russians and the Navajos by the Americans. Both the Chechen in Russian literature and the Navajo in American literature are often constructs, images derived from a potent combination of prejudices and received assumptions. In each case a relatively sizable corpus of writings produced over a century or longer exemplifies or attempts to counter persistent and influential modes of cultural stereotyping. The diachronic analysis of the portrayal of either the Chechens or the Navajos illuminates patterns of prejudice that have immense implications for both popular and high culture. The juxtaposition of the discussion of the two groups as they have been treated in Russian and American literature can deepen our understanding of the commonalities present in attempted cultural domination or ethnic idealization.

Navajos Wear Nikes reveals the complexity of modern life on the Navajo Reservation, a world where Anglo and Navajo coexist in a tenuous truce. With tales of gangs and skinwalkers, an Indian Boy Scout troop, a fanatical Sunday school teacher, and the author's own experience of sincere friendships that lead to hozho (beautiful harmony), Kristofic's memoir is an honest portrait of an Anglo boy growing up on and growing to love the Reservation. --publisher's description.
