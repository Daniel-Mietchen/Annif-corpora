Asylum law in the European Union
"This work examines the rules governing the right to asylum in the European Union. The book analyses a number of sources of law including international law, EU law and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The book considers the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol in order to understand the degree to which asylum obligations under international refugee law have been incorporated into the European Union. The book has a particular focus on the prohibition of refoulement the main obligation the EU law must confront. The dual nature of this principle is explored looking at both the obligation imposed upon a state to provide a fair procedure to determine the conditions of risk in the country of origin or destination, and also the obligation to refrain from or to respond to a possible expulsion.

The law of refugee status
"The first edition of The Law of Refugee Status (published in 1991) is generally regarded as the seminal text on interpreting the refugee definition set by the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention. Its groundbreaking analysis served as the bedrock not only for much judicial reasoning, but also for a burgeoning academic literature in law and related fields. This second edition builds on the strong critical focus and human rights orientation of the first edition, but undertakes an entirely original analysis of the jurisprudence of leading common law and select civil law states. The authors provide robust responses to the most difficult questions of refugee status in a clear and direct way. The result is a comprehensive and truly global analysis of the central question in asylum law: who is a refugee?"--
