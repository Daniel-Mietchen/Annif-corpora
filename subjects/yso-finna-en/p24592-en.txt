Cracked : a Danny Cleary novel
Seven and the ragged tiger
"After her stormy marriage ends, Danny Cleary jumps down the rabbit hole into a world of crack cocaine - delivered to her door by a polite but slightly deranged dealer. But when Danny's twin sister Ginger is murdered, Danny and her rock musician brother fly to California to find their nephews - and the people who killed their sister. Fighting her addiction, nosy cops and crazy drug dealers, she kicks ass and takes names, embracing her inner vigilante in a quest to avenge her sister and save her family. Cracked is a darkly comic roller-coaster ride to redemption as Danny struggles with bad guys and her own demons to find out who killed her twin"--Publisher's description.
