This study is made to provide the company, Design Agency Tuuletin Oy, with information that is needed to better understand customers' needs. The company's business idea is to be an innovative developer and  producer of creative concepts and technical solutions in the field of digital  communications. The future plan in the company is to start marketing their products and services on the Internet. That is why the company gave  an assignment to interview prospective customers about their habits and  interests in buying digital media products and services. In the future the company also wants to grow internationally by finding more customers abroad.  One objective of this study is to describe digital media, e-business and the  possibilities of Internet marketing. A second objective is to get information  about prospective customers and their preferences, and the third objective is to study the habits and interests in buying digital media products and  services. The purpose in the theoretical part is to give a description of e-business and  the facts concerning Internet marketing and also to give an overview of  digital media. In the empirical part data was collected from prospective customers of Tuuletin Oy. Different customer groups were approached to  gather information about their habits and interests. The Internet is a very useful network for marketers nowadays. They can develop new strategies, and by creating databases of product information  their customers can selectively obtain information. This minimizes the traditional barriers of time and distance between the marketers and the  customers. Due to the fact that e-business based marketing is growing and becoming  more common, the components of the traditional marketing system are facing a number of changes. Managers are required to reorganize and  develop new strategies as to how to market in an e-business environment. The very low rate of response had an effect on the reliability of the study; as a result it is impossible to generalize the results. The respondents' answers show that digital media nowadays has an important role in a  company's activities. Companies are going to buy more digital media  products and services in the future. The responses received also show that  there is a need for the digital products that Tuuletin designs and creates.

Michelle McGagh has been writing about money for over a decade. You'd think that would make her a whizz with her own cash, right? Wrong! Spending with abandon and ignoring bank statements were her modus operandi. Just because she wasn't in serious debt, apart from her massive London mortgage, she thought she was in control. She wasn't. Then Michelle discovered minimalism and sold 80% of her belongings. This was the first step to reining in her finances, and the second was to apply minimalism to her spending habits with a year-long spending ban. The aim: to pay off a huge chunk of her mortgage. She pays her bills and she has a minimal budget for her weekly groceries and household essentials but otherwise Michelle doesn't spend any money at all. She is finding creative ways to get the things she needs, to travel and to still be able to enjoy her time. Not only has she saved money but she is happier: no longer feeling the desire to buy things all the time or feeling the pressure of being sold. Her relationship with money, with things, with time, with others has changed for the better. This book is perfect for people who are by no means badly off but who often find themselves desperately waiting for pay day and wondering how on earth they frittered away their salary, who spend over GBP650 a year on their daily latte, who pop into Tesco Extra for a pint of milk and come out with GBP20 of random shopping, who never read their bank statements and who would like to learn how to set themselves up for a better life, buy their own home or prepare for their children's future or retirement. The No Spend Year is honestly written and talks about money in an approachable and entertaining way. Interspersed throughout are really brilliant personal finance tips and life hacks about interest, mortgages, savings, spending less to help you live a more financially secure life too.

In a politically uncertain and distrusted world, citizens appear to be seeking political expression in their everyday lives and quite prominently in their consumption practices. In advanced consumer societies, the politics of consumption have come to the centre stage. This book elaborates on the grounded perceptions, practices and problematizations of the equation of political action and market action. It presents the opportunities and hindrances of alternative forms of partaking in civic life by exploring how coffee activism presents a fruitful opportunity for citizens to participate in political life, how cultural citizenship can offer insights into the operation of everyday politics and how neoliberal narratives are framing discourses of coffee activism. The politics behind products can illuminate global tensions and engage citizens in social justice, but at the same time can confine civic action in the marketplace and anesthetise political action.
With the fast development of information technology, online games are becoming increasingly mainstream form of entertainment. This thesis is an exploratory study on Chinese online game consumer behaviour trying to understand their behaviour and make out what they need, how they are satisfied and what factors affect their choice. This thesis is sponsored by Baidu Inc. which is the largest online game company in China. The thesis will focus on the following problems: - How do consumers in general make purchase decisions? - How do consumers make online game purchase decisions in China? - What can be concluded on the basis of these findings from the online game company ÃÅs view? This research uses survey to collect information from the online game consumers to find out the decision making process and the factors that affect this process. In the theoretical part of this thesis, the five-stage model, presented as need recognition, searching for information, alternative evaluation, purchase and outcomes, is used as a conceptual framework to analyze the purchase decision making process of consumers in general. It describes the process that how a consumer makes his/her purchase decision. This process is influenced by external and internal factors. Those factors have strong impact on the decision making process. Those factors are considered together with the process. In the empirical part of this thesis, the information collected from the internet survey will be analyzed using the conceptual framework derived from the theoretical part. Online game players recognize need that can't be satisfied in the real world while can be easily fulfilled in online games. They search for game information from internal and external sources. As searching for game information, players evaluate possible alternatives. The purchase occurs after the player makes purchase decision. The evaluation will go on after the purchase. Based on the evaluation after the purchase, the purchase outcome may be satisfaction or dissatisfaction. External and internal factors have strong impact on this process. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on the basis of the former discussion. It shows that the Chinese online game consumer purchase decision making process generally follows the five-stage model. This process is influenced by internal and external factors. Suggestions are given to Baidu Inc.. Ideas for further studies are presented.

As nutrition, food is essential, but in today's world of excess, many have taken food beyond its functional definition to fine art status. From celebrity chefs to amateur food bloggers, individuals take ownership of the food they eat as a creative expression of personality, heritage, and ingenuity. Dwight Furrow examines the contemporary fascination with food and culinary arts not only as global spectacle but also as an expression of control, authenticity, and playful creation for individuals in a homogenized (and increasingly public) world.
