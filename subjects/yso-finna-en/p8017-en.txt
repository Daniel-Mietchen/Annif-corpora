"Teachers can be promoted to supervisory positions for a variety of reasons, such as excellent teaching skills, "people skills," or seniority. Seldom are teachers made supervisors because they have had specific professional preparation for the role." "This book, using case studies of actual teaching situations, illuminates an under-explored area of the language teaching profession. Important components of supervision, such as teacher evaluation, autonomy and authority, awareness, and attitude, are examined. A comprehensive review of the literature on supervision from a variety of fields - from business and industry to general education - offers valuable insights into the dynamic, interactive process of language teacher supervision. This book is a rich resource for teachers preparing to hold supervisory positions and for practicing language teacher supervisors alike.--Book jacket.
