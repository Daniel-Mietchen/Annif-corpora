"In today's perfectionistic culture, pregnant women are expected to be boundlessly optimistic and literally glowing with happiness. What often go unacknowledged are the physical and emotional challenges of pregnancy. This book offers strategies and solutions for confronting and relieving the stress of pregnancy. Think about some of the words so commonly used to describe a pregnant woman: "radiant," "glowing," "serene." But even for women who are thrilled to be having a baby, pregnancy can also be a difficult time filled with ambivalence, anxiety, and moodiness. Women who are typically accustomed to having complete control over their bodies endure waves of morning sickness, discomfort with their expanding belly, exhaustion, and anxiety about the impact a baby will have on their career, relationships, and freedom. Many pregnant women feel guilty about the challenging emotions; they face enormous societal pressure to be ecstatic about impending motherhood and wonder what is wrong with them when they don't feel the happiness they think they should be experiencing. Research shows that excessive stress during pregnancy is associated with premature birth and low birth weight. But relief does not come in the form of a pill--antidepressants have the potential to cause pregnancy complications and lifelong harm to unborn babies. Finding Calm for the Expectant Mom presents a seven-step program that shows women what they can do to feel happier, calmer, and less stressed in a safe and natural way. With the tools and problem-solving techniques presented here, women can adjust their expectations, restructure negative thought patterns, cultivate resiliency, and become better prepared to take on the role of motherhood"--

COPING WITH ILLNESS & SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. 'A week after my 50th birthday and just as our family was about to move home, something happened that changed the way I looked at life. I spoke to others about how they rebuilt their shattered worlds after very different personal traumas, emerging stronger than before. I hope our experiences, together with the latest science on resilience, will help guide all those going through tough times. This book says that it's possible not just to survive them, but to thrive. To rise.' Renowned as a much-loved and highly respected journalist and broadcaster with thirty years' experience, Sian Williams has studied the impact of acute stress for many years and is also a trained trauma assessor. In RISE, she explores the science of resilience and growth after trauma, offers advice from the experts, and learns from those who have emerged from horrific experiences, feeling changed yet stronger, with a new perspective on their life, their relationships and their work.

Has the developing world developed modern concepts of stress? Are coping methods the same around the globe? Such questions are not simple to answer, and until recently, few knew to ask them. In recent years, Western psychologists have recognized that their prevailing views of psychology do not always translate worldwide, and that no culture has a monopoly on either stress or coping. "The Handbook of Multicultural Perspectives on Stress and Coping" was created to address this realization. This unique volume moves beyond simple comparisons of behaviors in other countries by clarifying critical concepts in stress and coping, analyzing and synthesizing vast amounts of global data, and identifying constructs and methodologies necessary for meaningful cross-cultural research. An international, multiethnic panel of forty-five contributors presents elegant studies of stress, survival, and resilience as cultures evolve and countries interact, including: personal transformation as a coping strategy; psychological skills that enhance intercultural adjustment; individual versus collectivist values in coping; and Buddhist and Taoist traditions in coping. It provides details about the cumulative effects of historical, environmental, and political stressors on nations in the Middle East - Specific cross-cultural perspectives, from Latino-American families to Canadian aboriginal peoples to minority university students. The editors have assembled a vital store of knowledge, raising crucial implications for clinicians working with immigrant/international populations, and evaluating the current state of theory, research, and assessment. The Handbook documents major steps toward scientific advancement, and human understanding.

The reissue of a classic work, now with a foreword by Daniel Goleman Here is a monumental work that continues in the tradition pioneered by co-author Richard Lazarus in his classic book "Psychological Stress and the Coping Process," Dr. Lazarus and his collaborator, Dr. Susan Folkman, present here a detailed theory of psychological stress, building on the concepts of cognitive appraisal and coping which have become major themes of theory and investigation. As an integrative theoretical analysis, this volume pulls together two decades of research and thought on issues in behavioral medicine, emotion, stress management, treatment, and life span development. A selective review of the most pertinent literature is included in each chapter. The total reference listing for the book extends to 60 pages. This work is necessarily multidisciplinary, reflecting the many dimensions of stress-related problems and their situation within a complex social context. While the emphasis is on psychological aspects of stress, the book is oriented towards professionals in various disciplines, as well as advanced students and educated laypersons. The intended audience ranges from psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, nurses, and social workers to sociologists, anthropologists, medical researchers, and physiologists.
While many adults now understand how mindfulness practice helps us alleviate the stress and anxiety of our busy modern lives, getting a typical teenager on board is another story. Dr. Christopher Willard draws on his work with hundreds of young children, tweens, and teens - along with countless hours training parents, teachers, and other counselors - to make the principles and practices of mindfulness accessible, entertaining, and cool for people of all ages and interests. Features dozens of exercises to incorporate mindfulness into daily life (in class, extracurricular activities, among peers), specific meditations and movement practices, compassion training, and more.

Stress management : the essential guide to thinking and working smarter
Mindfulness in eight weeks : the revolutionary eight-week plan to clear your mind and calm your life
Stress has been experienced since ancient times, but it has never been worse than it is here in the early 21st century. Nowadays stress is responsible for more than fifty percent of all illness. Despite this fact, the phenomenon of stress still hasn't been that deeply studied.  Contemporary society has to deal with the relatively new concept of -workplace stress more and more often. In order to answer the questions as to: -Why? and -What to do? the problem of stress should be looked at in depth at individual workplaces. Only after this is done an appropriate and specific stress management programme can be created. The purpose of this present study is to determine the main reasons for and consequences of stress at work, and to find the most effective ways of preventing it and coping with it. The research also analyzes the overall current situation of stress at work and takes a look at some historical facts related to the origins of stress. People from different age groups, working spheres and cultures were invited for the interview during the year 2009, in order to get more information and practical examples from real life situations.  Since there wasn't really any specific research found on this topic, my study will be potentially quite useful to companies, especially in the success of their overall development. This research can be also presented to students in order to prepare them for the challenging working life which awaits them.

Stress management : increasing your stress resistance
Background: Mothers caring for an infant with unexplained, excessive crying, or infant colic, can experience overwhelming stress. Colic affects approximately 10-20% of all healthy newborns and typically manifests in the post-partum period. It is the most common complaint of pediatric health care providers in the first three months of life. Currently, the literature lacks a clear and effective intervention to improve colic symptoms. Mothers must cope with the challenges of caring for a colicky infant until symptoms remit. Aims: The specific aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention, The Happiest Baby on the Block, in reducing mother's stress and improving mother-to-infant bonding.^ Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with initially thirteen mothers. Participants were randomized to a treatment (n=7) or control group (n=6); four from the control group were lost to attrition. Mother's stress level was measured using the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, salivary cortisol and salivary amylase levels. Mother-to-infant bonding was measured using the Mother-to-Infant Bond Scale. Measurements were obtained at baseline and at about two weeks post-intervention.^ Results: A doubly multivariate analysis was used to compare the two groups across the two time periods. Although results revealed a reduction in mean stress and mother-to-infant bonding scores, statistical significance was not achieved (p=.133). ^ Conclusion: The behavioral intervention assessed in this study did not demonstrate statistical significance in reducing mother's stress levels or improving mother-to-infant bonding levels for mothers of colicky infants. A small sample size is a clear limitation and may have contributed to the non-significant findings. Further research is recommended with a large sample size and equal groups to validate findings.
