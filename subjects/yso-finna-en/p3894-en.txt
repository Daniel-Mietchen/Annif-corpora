This book extensively covers the different types of biomass (e.g. molasses, sugar beet pulp, cheese whey, sugarcane residues, palm waste, vegetable oil, straws, stalks and wood), various pretreatment approaches (e.g. physical, thermal, chemical, physicochemical and biological) and methods that show the subsequent production of biofuels and chemicals such as sugars, ethanol, extracellular polysaccharides, biodiesel, gas and oil. In addition to traditional methods such as steam, hot-water, hydrothermal, diluted-acid, organosolv, ozonolysis, sulfite, milling, fungal and bacterial, microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, torrefaction, pelletization, gasification (including biogas) and liquefaction pretreatments, it also introduces and discusses novel techniques such as nano and solid catalysts, organic electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids. This book offers a review of state-of-the-art research and provides guidance for the future paths of developing pretreatment techniques of biomass for biofuels, especially in the fields of biotechnology, microbiology, chemistry, materials science and engineering.

Production of biogas from farm pollution and protection of the environment in Russia
Traditional fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline have been dominating the transport fuel industry for decades. However in a situation where policies and agreements on reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy are made, it is likely that sustainable sources of energy will be increasing their market share, eventually completely or partly replacing fossil energy sources. The commissioner of this thesis operates a local biogas plant. The plant processes organic waste to produce biogas which can be refined into a transport fuel. The commissioner is planning on starting commercial distribution of biogas as a transport fuel in the year 2016. The aim of this thesis was to study and analyze the overall market conditions of biogas as transport fuel and provide recommendations on what marketing activities should be implemented by the commissioner. Thesis was made by conducting a secondary research using the available written sources and the access to industry knowledge acquired by of the commissioner. The marketing recommendations were made after conducting multiple strategic analyses, applying theory of B2B marketing, and taking notice of the realities and resources of a relatively small company. As a conclusion of this study, the commissioner was recommended to implement organized personal selling activities with the support of well-designed owned, earned and paid media. Relationship marketing practices should be implemented in order to maximize customer retention. The overall strategy of how and where to sell the product should be precisely decided, and some strategic insight and findings which were made during the research process are also presented in the report.
