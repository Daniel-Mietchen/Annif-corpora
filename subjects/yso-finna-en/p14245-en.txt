"This text examines the impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems, past, present and future. It especially considers the interactions between climate change and other drivers of change including hydromorphological modification, nutrient loading, acid deposition and contamination by toxic substances using evidence from palaeolimnology, time-series analysis, space-for-time substitution, laboratory and field experiments and process modelling. The book evaluates these processes in relation to extreme events, seasonal changes in ecosystems, trends over decadal-scale time periods, mitigation strategies and ecosystem recovery.The book is also concerned with how aspects of hydrophysical, hydrochemical and ecological change can be used as early indicators of climate change in aquatic ecosystems and it addresses the implications of future climate change for freshwater ecosystem management at the catchment scale.This is an ideal book for the scientific research community, but is also accessible to Masters and senior undergraduate students"--

Abstract: Isolation of DNA of sulfate-reducing bacteria and detection with qPCR  Mercury can be found in Finland's soil, and it is toxic for most microbes. There are microbes, which have resistances for mercury. Sulfate-reducing bacteria occur in polluted soil and even cells contain mercury. Sulfate-reducing bacteria can modify mercury to methyl mercury, which is more toxic than elemental mercury. Methyl mercury like mercury can accumulate to upwards in the food chain.    Finnish Forest Research Institute studies how whole-tree harvesting and stem-only har-vesting impacts on the mobilization of mercury and methyl mercury from drained peatland forests. For research eight peatlands from two different soils were chosen, half located on black schistsoil and other half on rock. Both four series of peatlands included one control site, one stem-only harvesting and two whole-tree harvesting peatlands.    The thesis focuses on sulfate-reducing bacteria contained in swamps that were known to include mercury. Impacts of sample depth, soil and harvesting to sulfate-reducing bacte-ria's concentration were studied. First total-DNA was isolated, and then DNA was purified with PEG-precipitation because of high inhibition. With 16S rRNA primers sample's DNA was confirmed in PCR. Next PCR was performed with specific dsrA primers to study sul-fate-reducing bacteria. Final concentration of sulfate-reducing bacteria was detected with qPCR.    Sulfate-reducing bacteria were found on most of the samples in different depths, but the highest occurrence was in deeper layers of soil. The result was logical, because most sulfate-reducing bacteria are anaerobic and like to live in the interface of anaerobic and aerobic. Rich soil contained clearly higher concentration of sulfate-reducing bacteria than poor one. Stem-only harvesting had lower concentration of sulfate-reducing bacteria than whole-tree harvesting due to alteration of soil's composition.    The ability on sulfate-reducing bacteria to process and resist oxygen and mercury vary between genus and even between species. Also the variety of sulfate-reducing bacteria chances in different depth of soil. That's why identification of sulfate-reducing bacteria is important.
