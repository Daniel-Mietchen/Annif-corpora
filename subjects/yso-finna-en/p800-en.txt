"As the manager of a customer contact center, you know your employees are among the most highly visible members of your organization, and their performance can make or break the success of virtually any project or product. Yet it is challenging to motivate them because they receive less training and lower pay than virtually anyone else in your organization. Managing and Motivating Contact Center Employees gives you the field-proven information, tools, and techniques you need to connect with your frontline staff and lead them to exceptional performance. It explains how to manage the critical "human" element in contact centers, which is often more important for overall performance than having the latest contact center technology or operational system. This results-oriented reference is written by contact center consultants for Dell, Microsoft, Bank of America, and other leading organizations to help you: Establish critical lines of communication between supervisors and contact center reps - Set clear expectations and provide appropriate feedback - Share knowledge freely, even as you listen and learn. Contact center employees are in daily, direct communication with your key customers and are an integral component of your company's long-term success. Learn how to draw out and utilize their motivation and talents, while maximizing their workplace satisfaction, with Managing and Motivating Contact Center Employees. Whether you are a contact center trainer, supervisor, or manager, Managing and Motivating Contact Center Employees provides tips and techniques to boost morale, streamline business processes, and inspire outstanding performance, including: Strategies to get and keep good contact center reps - Methods for transforming a group of individuals into a team - Proven techniques for building high morale - Tips for dealing with problem employees - Dozens of fun, self-directed training activities and much more." -- (takakansi)
