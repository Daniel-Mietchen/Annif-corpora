When the first edition of this book was published in The objective of this book is to impart practical hands-on knowledge about ECDIS. For less-experienced users, the book will help them to gain a valuable overview of the principles of ECDIS navigation and the related challenges. Meanwhile, it is likely that advanced ECDIS operators will also be able to find new answers and helpful suggestions. Based upon the principles of the IMO Model Course 1.27, the book is suitable for all kinds of ECDIS courses in different settings.

When the first edition of this book was published in 2009, the mandatory carriage of ECDIS had been agreed at IMO but implementation seemed a long way off. On 1 July 2012 a comprehensive rolling phase-in schedule began and this second edition recognises that practical guidance on equipment, training and operational practices is now needed urgently. Everything you need to understand in order to manage this fundamental change from navigating by paper charts to navigating by ECDIS is covered. This theoretical knowledge is made real through contributions from sea-going members of The Nautical Institute who have been using electronic charts for some time. Unsurprisingly, many of these contributions relate to training. Best practice is encapsulated in the industry recommendations for ECDIS training and familiarisation (including a familiarisation checklist), drawn up by a group coordinated by the Institute, which are included as appendices.
