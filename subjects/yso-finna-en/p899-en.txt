This volume presents numerical methods to solve soil physics problems using computers. It starts with the theory and then shows how to use Python code to solve the problems. Most soil physics books focus on deriving rather than solving the differential equations for mass and energy transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The focus of this book is on solutions. Agricultural and biological scientists usually have a good working knowledge of algebra and calculus, but not of differential equations. Here numerical procedures are used to solve differential equations.

The effect of power tiller operations on physical properties of soil under sawah system in Bida, Nigeria,was examined using an Indian model of VST-SHAKTI 130 DI with 10 kW (13 hp) rated power diesel engine of 2400 rpm rated crankshaft speed on different rice fields located at Shaba-Maliki and Ejeti village near Bida on a clayey loamy, sandy soil, under the guinea savannah ecology of Nigeria. Data were collected on soil properties such as soil moisture content, bulk density, porosity, penetrometer resistance/cone index and shear strength. The core technique was used in obtaining samples for bulk density measurement, and soil penetrometer and shear vane readings were determined <i>in situ</i>. Soil samples were obtained at various depths of 7 cm intervals, soil laboratory tests were all performed using standard procedures. The results show that the bulk density increased with depth both before and after operation, but the bulk density reduced after the operation. Porosity measured immediately after operation at different depths showed an improvement down the depth and the power tiller operations have improved the soil moisture content, reduced shear strength and penetration resistance respectively. Significant differences exist on these parameters before and after the tillage operations. The use of power tiller has a significant impact on the soil physical conditions for improving the soil conditions for a high yield for rice and not the usual deterioration effect often associated with the use of farm machinery on farm fields.
