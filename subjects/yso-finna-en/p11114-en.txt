Insider/outsider issues are of central importance for the definitions of religion and for the identity of religious groups, for the subjectivity and relationships of their adherents, for methodological issues within the study of religions and for the relationship between non-theological and thological studies of religion. Conceptions of 'inside', 'outside' and 'boundary', the emotions surrounding them, their origins in the social relations of body, family and strangers, and the metaphors used to depict and manage them all provide important insights for thinking about religions, how they are studies and by whom. A discussion of socio-spatial and cognitive linguistic theories of categorisation, containment and boundary-making is followed by several case studies in which territories and boundaries are explored with reference to the relationship between 'religion' and 'magic' in medieval Europe, the Enlightenment construction of 'religion', 'religions' and 'non-religion', and briefly, the disciplinary engagement of religious studies and theology. The application of the concept of the 'sacred' to these boundaries and the spaces they produce is considered.
The poetics of otherness combines two strange yet familiar ideas: meaning-making and the meaning of difference. Using the concept of otherness as an entry point into a discussion of poetry, Jonathan Hart continues his exploration of the role of history and theory in relation to literature and culture. Chapters range from trauma in Shakespeare, to Bartolomé de Las Casas' representation of the Americas, to the trench poets, to voices from the Holocaust. At the heart of this study is works that contend with violence and what beauty and truth poets, poet-soldiers, soldiers, and writers glean in the asymptotic search for expression.

We are living in a complex set of contradictory and confilicting relations with non-human animals.

"Strives to radically utilize Emmanuel Levinas's philosophical framework, bringing it into conversation with the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, to construct a post-ontotheological account of theology that unites theory and praxis. By allowing Levinas's Judaism to challenge von Balthasar's Catholicism, Glenn Morrison develops a perspective that is both theologically rich and philosophically provocative"--Provided by publisher.

"Challenging the critique of autoethnography as overly focused on the self, Tami Spry calls for a performative autoethnography that both unsettles the "I" and represents the Other with equal commitment. Expanding on her popular book Body, Paper, Stage, Spry uses a variety of examples, literary forms, and theoretical traditions to reframe this research method as transgressive, liberatory, and decolonizing for both self and Other. Her book  - draws on her own autoethnographic work with jazz musicians, shamans, and other groups; - outlines a utopian performative methodology to spur hope and transformation; - provides concrete guidance on how to implement this innovative methodological approach"--

Introduction : art in re-collecting others
Too often, Levinas' thought is distanced from traditional ethical enterprises, especially from normative ethics. It is put into the service of directly normative ends such as a call for respect for women or disadvantaged social groups, or for new normative understandings of the relation of doctors to patients or teachers to students and the like. There is nothing wrong with using Levinas for normative purposes, but this demands that we be clear on what account of normativity can be found in his work.Perpich re-reads central ethical concepts in Levinas' thought (alterity, the face, and responsibility) in order to offer the first full account of his contribution to our understanding of normativity or the ways in which others' claims are binding on us. She then extends this interpretation into two vexed areas of Levinas scholarship: the possibility of developing an environmental ethics based on his work and the possibility of applying his ethics to the emancipatory projects of new left social movements.

Animal alterity : science fiction and the question of the animal
Much discussed and debated among European philosophers, the philosophy of the alien and alien experience has been largely unavailable to English-language readers. Elegantly translated by Alexander Kozin and Tanja Stähler, Phenomenology of the Alien (Grundmotive einer Phänomenologie des Fremden) by Bernhard Waldenfels, the founder of phenomenological xenology, introduces essential concepts and questions that have defined the study of the alien. Waldenfels's patient and rigorous approach delineates the structure of the alien experience and asks how the alien can be analyzed and described without eliminating its alien character. Waldenfels shows the experience of the alien to be a multifaceted and multidimensional phenomenon that permeates our everyday experiences of the lifeworld with immediate implications for the ways we conduct our social, political, and ethical affairs. With impressive erudition Waldenfels weaves in various xenological themes from classical philosophy, contemporary phenomenology, literature, linguistics, sociology, and anthropology to address the boundaries of experience that unite and separate human beings, their collectives, their perceptions, and their aspirations. Phenomenology of the Alien brings readers to the forefront of phenomenological thought, outlining its major directions and offering-rich insights for-future-inquiry. Bernhard Waldenfels is a professor emeritus at the Ruhr-Universität in Bochum, where he leads a working group on phenomenology. He is the author of twenty-six books, including Order in the Twilight (1996), available in English.

Animal Alterity uses readings of science fiction texts to explore the centrality of animals for our ways of thinking about being human. It argues that the academic field of animal studies and the popular genre of science fiction share a number of critical concerns: thinking about otherness and the nature of human being; desiring communication across species difference; and interrogating the social and ethical consequences of changes in science and technology. --
