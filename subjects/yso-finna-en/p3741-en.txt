computer-integrated manufacturing CIM
Cimosa : Open system architecture for CIM
Automation, production systems, and computer-integrated manufacturing
Introduction to robotics in CIM systems
About the Book: The new edition of CAD/CAM/CIM has been brought out to focus on the response of CIM technology to address to new challenges faced by manufacturing in the new millennium. CIM is moving towards more and more sophistication in exploiting the capabilities of computer hardware and software. This book gives a detailed account of various technologies which form computer based automation of manufacturing activities. Computer aided shape design and geometric modeling have been revised and an introduction to robust design has been added. Design coverage is enlarged by adding FEA.
