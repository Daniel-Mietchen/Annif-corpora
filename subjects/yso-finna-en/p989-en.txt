The authors divide the book into three easy to read sections. Part One provides the reader with an overview of the 'anorexic' and 'bulimic' personality. The reader is informed of the sociological complexity of eating for the person with anorexia or bulimia and the immense turmoil a sufferer experiences in maintaining food/body control.

The binge/purge syndrome called bulimia is a much misunderstood condition, and one which is increasing in our diet-obsessed society. Sufferers may be of average weight, with no apparent signs of food aversion or obsession, yet their eating habits are totally out of control. This book provides a clear and supportive account of what bulimia is, how it differs from anorexia, and how it can be tackled and defeated. Information, reassurance and sound advice are sensitively balanced in this book, which provides sufferers, their families, friends and doctors with the key to unlocking the hidden nightmare of bulimia.

Through the voices of twenty-one women, Karen Way presents the most objective, complete, and compassionate picture of what anorexia nervosa is about and, more importantly, of the complex individual variables and obstacles in the journey to recovery. From the premise that anorexia nervosa is an addiction - an obsession controlling all aspects of an individual's life - and that complete recovery is possible by finding meaning in life, this enlightening book contrasts sharply to other books written on the subject by clinicians and theorists which merely speculate on the nature and etiology of anorexia nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa and Recovery lets the reader hear the personal struggles of women who have fought this powerful disease. They describe how anorexia controlled their lives and how, once they overcame their obsessions with food, weight, and thinness, they were able to lead fulfilling lives.

People with eating disorders often make desparate attempts to exert magical control over their bodies in response to the threats they experienced in relationships. Mary Levens takes the reader into the realm of magical thinking and its effect on ideas about eating and the body through a sensitive exploration of the images patients create in art therapy, in which themes of cannibalism constantly recur. Drawing on anthropology, religion and literature as well as psychoanalysis, she discusses the significance of these images and their implications for treatment of patients with eating disorders.

The contents of this thesis focuses on eating disorders among adolescents. The topic was chosen, because eating disorders are a growing global health problem with high mortality, and adolescents are the biggest risk group for developing them. Providing a reliable source of information may help prevent adolescent eating disorders by educating the public. The task of this project was to create web pages on eating disorders with a main focus on creating a guide which will provide a source of reliable information about eating disorders. This project focuses on the three main groups of eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). There was an extensive literature review done in order to accomplish the webpages and make the information provided on the webpages reliable. The information provided in this thesis will be published in Terveysnetti, a health informative website containing public information about health and illness issues. To be able to recognize eating disorders among adolescents, the three main groups of eating disorders have been identified in this project, with their symptoms and ways of recognition, possible risk factors and treatment. The risk factors have been divided into three groups: biological, psychological and social risk factors. The treatment methods were discussed only briefly, since this project aims to educate the public about eating disorders, not to provide instructions for their management.

The role of drug treatments for eating disorders
It should not surprise us that so many are finding unique value in the experiential techniques. The fact that eating-disordered patients adopt physical and often complex metaphoric means of expressing their emotional pain suggests the difficulty we are likely to encounter in asking them to articulate the inarticulable. In moving to spatial, kinesthetic, and symbolic expression, we are, in a sense, agreeing to speak the patient's language rather than our own. Given the very nature of eating disorders, many clinicians are finding that experiential methods are particularly applicable for treating patients who suffer from them. Providing a valuable new tool for practitioners, Experiential therapies for eating disorders is the first text to focus solely on the application of expressive therapies and experiential techniques to the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Throughout, important clinical issues that often accompany eating disorders also are addressed, including such topics as self-awareness, self-esteem, autonomy, identity, impulse regulation, affect modulation, body image, and interpersonal relationships. Countertransferential issues are examined, and areas needing further exploration such as father's role in the development of eating disorders, the hypnotizability of eating disordered patients, and the role of family in the treatment process are delineated.
Introduction to abnormal child and adolescent psychology
This collection expands on Susie Orbach's claim that obsessive eating or non-eating behavior is an individual, albeit political, response to a "complex set of social circumstances" in which women find themselves. Theoretical pieces here bolster her views, exploring the neopuritanical replacement of sex by food, compulsive eating as anger, and symmetries between the bulimic and anorexic internalization of ego boundaries and strategies for control. Essays highlighting alternative therapies are full of case references and the compelling voices of sufferers.
