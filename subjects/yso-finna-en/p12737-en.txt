Today, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are bombarded by challenges demanding innovative responses. Financial pressures on prospective students increase, modifying relationships between student and university. Rising student expectations require a review of the learning landscapes of higher education systems. A response commonly adopted is the improvement of 'student engagement', a term widely used but often misunderstood or misinterpreted. Student Engagement: Identity, Motivation and Community argues that student engagement must be addressed systematically and strategically. It requires more than the adoption of 'consumer' approaches to student learning, or palliatives such as the cosmetic boosting of student numbers on university committees. Students must be empowered to make change for themselves, creating 'active citizens'.
