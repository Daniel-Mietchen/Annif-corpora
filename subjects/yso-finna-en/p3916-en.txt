Abstract: This report is a study into the possible application of social media within the communication strategy of Gassan Diamonds, a diamond wholesaler and retailer located in Amsterdam in The Netherlands. Gassan Diamonds has yet to implement a social media strategy so a knowledge gap was identified as to how this could be done. The research consisted of studying the current uses and trends in social media and combining it with tourism trends related to Amsterdam to develop a social media strategy targeted at tourists in Amsterdam travelling outside of a tour group.
