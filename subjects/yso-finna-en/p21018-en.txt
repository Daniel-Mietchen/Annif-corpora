This thesis was commissioned by HAMK University of Applied Sciences an international and multidisciplinary institution delivering professional higher-level education. Research and development plays an important role in HAMK's operations by supporting local businesses and regional development. The thesis was assigned to help the development of Customer Relationship Management at HAMK by increasing effectiveness and the quality of relationship management with the aim of having commonly agreed CRM procedures supported by a CRM-tool in the future. The first objective was to describe the theory of CRM. The second objective was to analyse the current state and system of CRM at HAMK. The third objective was to analyse the main reasons for the current problems, and the fourth objective was to outline the most important features to consider when developing the HAMK CRM infrastructure.   The structure of the thesis was formulated to start with the theory and follow with the empirical part. The main information source used was literature written about CRM to give understanding and background for the reader. In the empirical part study was divided in two. To begin with, a survey was followed-up with the interviews in order to discover more thorough knowledge on HAMK's current state of CRM. The results of the study showed that in CRM value chain creation HAMK should concentrate more on the supporting conditions in order to build up a strong basis by creating a customer strategy and a customership plan by keeping an eye on communication, commitment and follow up. With a thorough planning phase and implementation, a commonly agreed CRM strategy and procedures enabling the customisation of the right kind of CRM tool to support customer relationship management operations can be created.
