"The Corporate Objective addresses a question that has been subject to much debate: what should be the objective of public corporations? It examines the two dominant theories that address this issue, the shareholder primacy and stakeholder theories, and finds that both have serious shortcomings. The book goes on to develop a new theory, called the Entity Maximisation and Sustainability Model. Under this model, directors are to endeavour to increase the overall long-run market value of the corporation as an entity. At the same time as maximising wealth, directors have to ensure that the corporation survives and is able to stay afloat and pursue the development of the corporation's position. Andrew Keay seeks to explain and justify the model and discusses how the model is enforced, how investors fit into the model, how directors are to act and how profits are to be allocated. Analysing in depth the existing theories which seek to explain the corporate objective, this book will appeal to academics in corporate law and corporate governance as well as law, finance, business ethics, organisational behaviour, management, economics, accounting and sociology. Postgraduate students in corporate law and corporate governance, directors, and government regulators will also find much to interest them in this study"--Provided by publisher.
"Conflict of interest occurs at all levels of governance, ranging from local to global, both in the public and the corporate and financial spheres. There is increasing awareness that conflicts of interest may distort decision-making processes and generate inappropriate outcomes, thereby undermining the functioning of public institutions and markets. However, the current worldwide trend towards regulation, which seeks to forestall, prevent and manage conflicts of interest, has its price. Drawbacks may include the stifling of decision-making processes, the loss of expertise among decision-makers and a vicious circle of distrust. This interdisciplinary and international book addresses specific situations of conflict of interest in different spheres of governance, particularly in global, public and corporate governance"--

"The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance"--
Abstract: This research was focused on Corporate Governance Codices and the possible applicability  to organizations of the mid-tier business sector. The reason behind conducting  this research was the demand on finding a sufficient management strategy  supporting the management level to deal with the high predisposition for insolvency  of most mid-tier companies. With reference to this demand the current situation and  challenges of such companies were deliberated. In the context of stock listed, public  held companies the key aspect of this demand already has been realized during the  1990s where it was responded with the introduction of international Codices for  Corporate Governance.  Within the theoretical framework to this Thesis the fundamentals and principal theories  of Corporate Governance were presented on basis of secondary data. To deepen  the understanding of the concept the main objectives of the Corporate Governance  activities were profoundly introduced. Furthermore, as this Thesis refers to the possible  applicability of Corporate Governance Codices also the structure and contents  of two actual Corporate Governance Codes of Conduct were demonstrated. Because  of the fact Corporate Governance Codices originally have been developed for corporations  listed on a stock exchange special attention has been paid on describing the  structural differences between listed and mid-tier companies.  In order to evaluate the possible transferability of Corporate Governance Codices to  organizations of the mid-tier business sector a deductive content analysis has been  conducted. This survey consisted of a theoretical as well as practical approach. The  theoretical approach was utilized to define the contents of a Corporate Governance  Code as applicable or not applicable for mid-tier companies. On basis of the results  from the theoretical approach the practical approach has surveyed the current extent  of application of the as applicable defined Code principles at the case company  Kraftanlagen MuÌˆnchen.  The results of the research have verified that the actual applicability of Corporate  Governance to mid-tier organizations is rather limited. Yet, throughout the research  process an important set of applicable minimum requirements have been identified.

"Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are unique economic and governance events as privately held firms issue common stock or shares to the public for the first time. The governance issues surrounding IPOs are relatively unexamined compared to more established, and usually larger, firms. As such, they provide a unique context to study corporate governance and its development around the world. Based on a collaborative international research project, this book analyses the corporate governance of IPOs in twenty-one countries, each of which is characterized by different governance environments and different levels of IPO activity. The end result is a broad and deep assessment of governance practices and IPO activity for an array of economies that represent roughly 80 percent of the global economy. These chapters collectively provide new insights into what a global theory of corporate governance might look like and offer guidance to policy makers and academics regarding national governance configurations".

"Many economists now accept that informal institutions and culture play a crucial role in economic outcomes. Driven by the work of economists such as Nobel laureates Douglass North and Gary Becker, there is an important body of work that invokes cultural and institutional factors to build a more comprehensive and realistic theory of economic behavior. This book provides a comprehensive overview of research in this area, sketching the main promises and challenges faced by the field. The first part introduces and explains the various theoretical approaches to studying culture in economics, going back to Smith and Weber, and addresses the methodological issues that need to be considered when including culture in economics. The second part of the book then provides readers with a series of examples that shows how the cultural approach can be used to explain economic phenomena in four different areas: entrepreneurship, trust, international business and comparative corporate governance"--

"The purpose of this book is to examine the theories and practice of how to control corporate behaviour through legal techniques. The principal theories examined are deterrence, (especially economic analysis), the findings of empirical research on responsive regulatory systems, and the findings of behavioural psychology research. Leading examples of the various approaches are given in order to illustrate the models: private enforcement of law through litigation in the USA, public enforcement of competition law by the European Commission, and the recent reform of policies on public enforcement of regulatory law in the United Kingdom. Noting that behavioural psychology has as yet had only limited application in legal and regulatory theory, the book then analyses various European regulatory structures where behavioural techniques can be seen or could be applied. The book concludes by proposing an holistic model for maximising compliance within large organisations, combining public regulatory and criminal controls with internal corporate systems and external influences by stakeholders, held together by a unified core of ethical principles."--Publisher description.
