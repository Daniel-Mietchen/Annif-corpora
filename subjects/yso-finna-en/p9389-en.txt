"Lobbying has long been part of the political landscape. But in recent years links between big business and government have become stronger and more far-reaching than ever. Global corporations now demand control over decisions affecting labour laws, finance, public health, food and agriculture, safety regulations, taxes and international trade and investment. They even claim the right to private tribunals where they can sue governments for passing laws that could harm their present or future profits.These business elites don t want to govern directly. They operate behind the scenes - directing planning, setting standards and fashioning government to maximise their own profits. Thanks to the UN Global Compact they have extended their influence to the highest levels of multilateral decision-making and now, via the Davos-inspired Global Redesign Initiative, they are setting their sights on managing world-wide public policy. Elected by and accountable to no one, secretive and highly organized, these shadow sovereigns are destroying the very notion of the common good and making a mockery of democracy. It is high time we challenged this assault on our rights and our institutions. In this incisive and clear-sighted book Susan George provides us with the practical knowledge to do just that"

This paper considers the reasons for increasing the interest of Russian leaders in improving the investment climate in Russia. The paper shows that this change in economic policy is connected not only to the natural rent decline but also reflects the search of the ruling coalition for a new social base represented by successful medium-sized business. These new trends can be interpreted in terms of the "limited access order" concept developed in the recent works of Douglass North and his co-authors.  Keywords: Russian transition economy, rents, bureaucracy, large and medium-sized business, response to the crises, investment climate  .
Report of the Workshop on the Transition Economies, China and Vietnam: Integration with Global Markets : some political and economic conclusions : 15-16 June 1996, Budapest, Hungary
"The mistakes the U.S. has made in Latin America-and the high price it will pay for them Washington has long told Latin American countries how to run their economies: bring in multinationals, eliminate the social safety net, keep government debt low, court U.S. politicians, and sign free trade agreements. In the past decade, many leaders-Hugo Chavez among the most visible-have rejected that, and those countries are now growing while the U.S. is falling apart. Combining sharp wit and great storytelling with trenchant analysis, Hal Weitzman explains why Latin America has turned against its powerful northern neighbor and why the region's newfound economic success will hurt the U.S. Reveals how the politics of oil and the rise of "resource nationalism" are reshaping America's role in the global economy and negatively affecting its prosperity at home Illustrates analytical points with vivid stories and examples: the disappearance of the Panama hat, the sweater Evo Morales wore on a trip to Europe, and more Written by a Financial Times journalist who formerly served as their Andean correspondent based in Lima, Peru."

"Twelve years have passed since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), an event that marked an important milestone in China-Africa relations. The forum is a platform to promote mutually beneficial South-South cooperation between China and Africa, based on mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of African countries. In its ten year existence, FOCAC has achieved in deepening China-Africa relations in the economic field. Trade, investment, infrastructure and capacity building have been comprehensively promoted. But as FOCAC prepares to enter the second decade, a number of steps must be taken by Chinese and African partners to improve the current institutional arrangement by expanding space for private sector and civil society participation in decision-making and by increasing the frequency of follow-up processes to ensure effective implementation of agreed upon targets." --Publisher's description.
"Enduring rivalries recurrently ensnare states in militarized disputes and wars. Are they poised to intensify in the Asia-Pacific, a region characterized by regime and cultural differences, territorial contests, and competing nationalist and regime claims? It is often argued that these conditions and recent power shifts are likely to lead to conflict escalation and contagion, especially in Sino-American relations. Steve Chan's book challenges this common view and argues instead that Asia-Pacific rivalries are likely to be held in abeyance. He suggests that the majority of leaders in the region wish to base their political legitimacy on their economic performance rather than popular mobilization against foreign enemies. Economic interdependence and political multilateralism have restrained and in some cases reversed rivalries. Although Asia-Pacific states will continue to quarrel, Chan argues that their relations are more stable today than at any other time since 1945"-- Provided by publisher.

"The Origins of American Hegemony in Europe Originally published in Italian in 1980, Gli Stati Uniti e il fascismo: Alle origini dell'egemonia Americana in Italia is regarded today as a crucial text on the relationship between the United States and Italy during the interwar years. Aside from the addition of two new prefaces - one by the author and one by the book's translator, Molly Tambor - the original text has remained unchanged, so that Anglophone readers now have the opportunity to engage with this classic work. By analyzing the enduring relationship between the United States - especially its financial establishment - and fascist Italy up until Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia in 1935, this book provides answers to some key questions about the interconnectedness of America's rise to hegemonic global financial power in the twentieth century and its support of Italian fascism during this time. Gian Giacomo Migone is Professor of History of Euroatlantic Relations at the University of Torino, Italy. He is the author of Problemi di Storia nei Rapporti tra Italia e Stati Uniti (1971) and Banchieri Americani e Mussolini (1979), and he has written numerous essays concerning Euro-Atlantic relations before, during, and after the Cold War. He was a member of the Italian Senate, where he chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, the United Nations System Staff College Advisory Board, the Civilian Affairs Committee, and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, from 1992 to 2001. He is the founder and first editor of L'indice dei Libri del Mese, an Italian cultural monthly. Molly Tambor is Assistant Professor of European History at Long Island University Post. She is the author of The Lost Wave: Women and Democracy in Postwar Italy (2014)"--
India-ASEAN economic relations : meeting the challenges of globalization
There was fear that the global economic crisis would interrupt the flow of remittances to developing countries, force migrants to return to their sending households and endanger the economic health of sending nations. However, anxiety over the collapse of remittances was largely unfounded. While there was a small decline in remittance flows globally in 2009, in general, they did not fall as far or as quickly as other forms of assistance and they have begun to recover. In this paper we examine a series of myths that colour the remittance debate. Debunking the myths that surround remittances allows us to show the complex role remittances play for migrants, their sending households and communities as developing nations cope with the global economic crisis..

Evolution of ASEAN-Japan relations
"Japan's relations with its closest neighbors, China and Korea, are tense - exacerbated by disputes over territorial issues and the unresolved trauma of a tumultuous twentieth-century history. In this book, the author, a veteran Japanese diplomat, examines his nation's relations with its East Asian neighbors along a temporal axis stretching back some two thousand years, a perspective he feels is essential to the construction of a new Asian diplomacy. In his view, Japan's relations with China and Korea in modern times have tended to be understood within the context of Japan's relations with the West, and Japanese diplomacy has often operated as a dependent variable of the foreign policies of the Western powers. Yet as the political and economic importance of Asia seems destined to increase in coming years, the interplay of foreign policies among the Asian nations themselves should receive more of a spotlight. In order to fully appreciate Japan's place in Asia and what must be done to rebuild relations with China and Korea, an examination of the deeper patterns of historical contact among these nations serves as an essential point of departure." from back cover

The global political economy is inescapably cultural. Whether we talk about the economic dimensions of the "war on terror", the sub-prime crisis and its aftermath, or the ways in which new information technology has altered practices of production and consumption, it has become increasingly clear that these processes cannot be fully captured by the hyper-rational analysis of economists or the slogans of class conflict. This book argues that culture is a concept that can be used to develop more subtle and fruitful analyses of the dynamics.
"Combinging a sharp wit, great storytelling, and trenchant analysis, Weitzman explains why Latin America turned against the US, and why their newfound economic success is likely to hurt us. For most of the '80s and '90s, Latin America was subjected to "The Washington Consensus" as banks and governments demanded countries ignore the needs of their citizens in the short term and turn over their best assets to foreigners, in order to attract international financial investments."
