OIL PAINTING SECRETS FROM A MASTER
Marine painting in oil
No medium competes with oil in the world of portrait painting, and oil is best used to demonstrate principles of skin tones. In Chris Saper's second portrait book for North Light, readers will learn to incorporate life studies to improve accuracy in seeing and recording skin tones. Readers will enjoy two demonstrations for each of seven diverse subjects--one from life, and one from a finished portrait from photographs. Readers will enjoy rendering skin tones in oil as they are shown information on palette selection and materials; lighting and posing the model; the live sitting; the photographic sitting; and mini exercises on specific facial features. Includes all-new art, new information on photography, new step-by-step demonstrations and more.
