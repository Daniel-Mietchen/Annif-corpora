Writers, books, and trade : an eighteenth-century miscellany for William B. Todd
The objective of the thesis was to find out what kind of an e-marketing mix would be optimal for the Law and Training department of Edita Publishing Oy. The purpose was to study the theories concerning the e-marketing mix and how they apply to Edita Publishing Oy. Another intention was to find out whether the created e-marketing mix would be applicable in practice. The theoretical framework was based on literature and Internet sources about the e-marketing mix, the publishing industry and non-fiction publishing. A model was created comparing three e-marketing mix theories that was used as a basis to construct the theoretical e-marketing mix model for Edita Publishing Oy. The final e-marketing mix model bases on the theoretical e-marketing mix and the research results. The study was conducted in the form of interviews with employees and marketing professionals of Edita Publishing Oy as well as with a competing publisher. The research method was qualitative. The data was analysed against theoretical information that was the basis of the interview questions. In addition, data was gathered from different literature and Internet-pages that were linked to the data collected from the interviews. The findings suggested that the created e-marketing mix would need alterations to be applicable. The lack of resources appeared to be a hindering factor for some of the improvements suggested. Also, Edita Publishing Oy̕ scurrent mission was to improve their customer relationships and interact with their customers better online. The results also indicated that some parts of the e-marketing mix model can only be implemented in the future. In conclusion, the e-marketing mix created for the Law and Training department would be applicable with the changes received from the qualitative research. The created e-marketing mix focuses on interactivity, privacy and security, customer service, promotion, product and price. The decline in the economy has forced publishers to develop new low cost methods to reach customers.

The economic efficiency of accommodation service PFI projects
The world of book publishing is going through turbulent times. For nearly five centuries the methods and practices of book publishing remained largely unchanged, but at the dawn of the 21st century the industry finds itself faced with perhaps the greatest challenges since Gutenberg. A combination of economic pressures and technological change is forcing publishers to alter their practices and think hard about the future of the book in the digital age. In this book - the first major study of trade publishing for more than 30 years - Thompson situates the current challenges facing the industry in an historical context, analyzing the transformation of trade publishing in the United States and Britain since the 1960s. He gives a detailed account of how the world of trade publishing really works, dissecting the roles of publishers, agents and booksellers and showing how their practices are shaped by a field that has a distinctive structure and dynamic. Against this backdrop Thompson analyzes the impact of the digital revolution on book publishing and examines the pressures that are reshaping the field of trade publishing today.
