Early communicative skills
"Language Disabilities in Cultural and Linguistic Diversity" takes a critical perspective on traditional bio-cognitive-social approaches to language disabilities - specific language impairment, communication difficulties, dyslexia and deafness. A socio-cultural approach orientates a reinterpretation of research, educational practices and policies in assessment, teaching and intervention. A Vygotskian framework affords repositioning of assessment, learning and development for language disabilities as they are influenced and shaped by experiences of multilingualism, culture, ethnicity and race. The author, rather than present definitive answers, aims to offer new analyses and extend current understanding of linguistic phenomena fraught by dilemmas of disentangling diversity and disability. The volume serves as a source of reflection and inquiry for students, professionals and policy makers in education and health who are interested in disability and language disabilities in multilingual and multicultural contexts.

An analysis of speech dysfunctions in Multiple Sclerosis patients
This comprehensive text presents both theory and practice in a balanced treatment of impairment-based and communication-based disorders. In a relaxed writing style aimed at students, author Albyn Davis uses a single, coherent voice across the chapters to establish a consistent way of thinking about the material, while noting inter-chapter relationships. Explanatory “walk-throughs” help to make challenging topics clear. Special topics cover therapeutic software and other technologies, levels of evidence, neuroplasticity, new medical treatments, quality of life, and primary progressive aphasia.
