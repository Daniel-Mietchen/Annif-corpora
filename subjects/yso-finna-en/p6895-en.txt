Transmedia storytelling and Lost path to success
Narrative is a pioneer concept in our trans-disciplinary age. For decades, it has been one of the most successful catchwords in literature, history, cultural studies, philosophy, and health studies. While the expansion of narrative studies has led to significant advances across a number of fields, the travels for the concept itself have been a somewhat more complex. Has the concept of narrative passed intact from literature to sociology, from structuralism to therapeutic practice or to the study of everyday storytelling? In this volume, philosophers, psychologists, literary theorists, sociolinguists, and sociologists use methodologically challenging test cases to scrutinize the types, transformations, and trajectories of the concept and theory of narrative. The book powerfully argues that narrative concepts are profoundly relevant in the understanding of life, experience, and literary texts. Nonetheless, it emphasizes the vast contextual differences and contradictions in the use of the concept.

Throwing light on more serious problems without pronouncing a single serious phrase, giving into the thrill of the contemporary world whilst avoiding any realism - that is 'The Festival of Insignificance'. It can be considered a synthesis of all Kundera's work. A strange synthesis. A strange epilogue. A strange laugh, inspired by our era which is comic because it has lost all sense of humour.

Speech about speech : a development study on form and function of direct and indirect speech
Working with or without a native speaker, a storyteller can touch the minds and hearts of all listenerseven those with little or no English language skills. Here a group of expert storytellers share a variety of tips and techniques that help bridge the language gap; along with sample stories that librarians, teachers, and professional storytellers can easily incorporate into their repertoires. Four basic techniques for bilingual telling are explored: summarizing, line-by-line translation, tandem telling, and inserted phrases. In addition, contributors discuss such topics as the translator's role, using story in language instruction, presenting tellers of other languages, traveling and giving workshops abroad, and more.

Spin-Fold-Spill is a solo performance, installation and written thesis that  explores the Role-System, a system of roles that represents parts of a  personality. The performance and installation took place during May 2011. This written component articulates and documents the performance whilst  aiming to re-perform the live performance in a textual form. This body of  work fits within the fields of live art and performance studies.  Spin-Fold-Spill is about how to obscure autobiographical material through  the fiction of roles. It is about exploring monologue, about speaking  subjects, about telling ones own story and simultaneously playing with the  certainty of whose story it is/ was.  The body of the performance and this written component are structured in  twelve parts that are represented by twelve colour combinations. The  audience / reader can choose the order by selecting a colour order of their  choice.  Various overlapping themes are explored within Spin-Fold-Spill such as:  multiple persona in artistic practice, compartmentalisation, melancholia  and performativity, storytelling, and the function of the video camera in  developing a role's fictitious history.

Once a year, on All Souls' Day, it is said in Ireland that the dead may return. 'Solar Bones' is the story of one such visit. Set in the west of Ireland as the recession is about to strike, this novel is a portrait of one man's experience when his world threatens to fall apart. Marcus Conway, a middle-aged engineer, turns up one afternoon at his kitchen table and considers the events that took him away and then brought him home again.
