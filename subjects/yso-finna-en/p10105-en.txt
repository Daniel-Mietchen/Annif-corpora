Choreographers in motion : retrospective and perspectives
In today’s visual regime, contemporary dance operates as a critical force. It questions univocal representations and dominant cultural ideals of the body. Developing alternative approaches to physical expression, certain choreographers create body images that are vulnerable and permeable to the world. Their critical and experimental approach challenges and expands spectatorship, including the corporeal, technological and cultural elements that support the ways we see, hear, sense and imagine. Through the Back: Situating Vision between Moving Bodies seeks to articulate this critical potential in a series of essays that explores the work of experimental choreographers active throughout the noughties: Alexander Baervoets, Boris Charmatz, Meg Stuart, Benoit Lachambre, Vera Mantero, Philipp Gehmacher, Jennifer Lacey and Nadia Lauro, and deufert & plischke.

Includes dance performances and conversations with Garry Stewart, artistic director of ADT, Gina Czarnecki, video projection (Devolution), Louis-Philippe Demers, robotics (Devolution),   Anouk van Dijk, artistic director, and Goyi Tangale, artistic director of Wanted Posse.   In Devolution Garry Stewart collaborated with Canadian multi-disciplinary artist Louis-Philippe Demers, UK video artist Gina Czarnecki and London based costume designer Georg Meyer-Wiel   to create an unique world the likes of which Australian theatre has never produced before.   Situating humans in communion with multiple robotic machines of both large and medium scale, a large scale robotic, kinetic set and lighting design, a multitude of robotic prostheses   and ambulating robotic constructs as well as extraordinary video art, Devolution redefines the relationship between machine and body.   Anouk van Dijk discusses her dance work titled Stau. France's astonishing Wanted Posse perform their electric production Bad Moves-a showcase of what the body is   capable of doing 'when scored to melodious beats', in a surreal world of humanoids, living in a parallel universe.
Before, between, and beyond : three decades of dance writing
The male dancer : body, spectacle, sexualities
[Often called the Picasso, Stravinsky, or Frank Lloyd Wright of the dance world, Martha Graham revolutionized ballet stages across the globe. Using newly discovered archival sources, award-winning choreographer and dance historian Mark Franko reframes Graham's most famous creations, those from the World War II era, by restoring their rich historical and personal context. Graham matured as an artist during the global crisis of fascism, the conflict of World War II, and the post-war period that ushered in the Cold War. Franko focuses on four of her most powerful works, American document (1938), Appalachian spring (1944), Night journey (1948), and Voyage (1953), tracing their connections to Graham's intense feelings of anti-fascism and her fascination with psychoanalysis. Moreover, Franko explores Graham's intense personal and professional bond with dancer and choreographer Erick Hawkins. The author traces the impact of their constantly changing feelings about each other and about their work, and how Graham wove together strands of love, passion, politics, and myth to create a unique and iconically American school of choreography and dance.]

Who are you?
Choreographing Problems: Expressive Concepts in European Contemporary Dance and Performance illuminates the relationship between the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and experimental dance and performance in the works of leading European choreographers, Xavier Le Roy, Jonathan Burrows, Boris Charmatz, Eszter Salamon, Mette Ingvartsen, Jefta van Dinther, and Jan Ritsema. Combining intricate analysis of seven groundbreaking works, including Self Unfinished by Le Roy (1998) and Weak Dance Strong Questions (2001) by Burrows and Ritsema, with a philosophical discussion of the body, movement and time in performance, as well as the notions of theatricality, affect, improvisation and process, the capacity of choreography to 'express' thought is unravelled. Choreographing problems involves composing ruptures between movement, the body and duration in performance such that they engender a shock upon sensibility, one that inhibits recognition. This book offers a practical insight into the matters of choreography: it allows both the versed and the non-trained spectator to observe in detail how the thought and the practices of making, performing and attending reinvent performance and dance today.

In the spring of 1961 Simone Forti presented a program titled Five Dance Constructions and Some Other Things in a concert series organized by her friend, composer La Monte Young, at the New York loft studio of Yoko Ono.   These radically new dances created circumstances for the performers' direct, non-stylistic actions.   Each of the pieces was performed in a different place in the loft, with the audience moving from location to location to view them.   Some of the pieces required elementary structures – a hanging rope, rectangular wooden boxes – which were placed throughout the loft like a sculptural installation.  In 2004 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles invited Forti to re-create these dance constructions at the Geffen Contemporary space, in conjunction with the exhibition A Minimalist Future? Art as Object 1958 – 1986.   This DVD documents that evening and includes Huddle, Slant Board, Platforms, See Saw, Roller Boxes and Accompaniment for La Monte's 2 sounds and La Monte's 2 sounds.   The soundtrack of La Monte Young's 2 Sounds has been re-mastered and the composer's notes accompany the video. In addition there is a question and answer session with Forti at the conclusion of the performances.
