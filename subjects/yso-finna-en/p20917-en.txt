A bride's story. 4
Princess Elisa is a disappointment to her people. Although she bears the Godstone, a sign that she has been chosen for an act of heroism, they see her as lazy and useless and fat. On her sixteenth birthday, she is bartered off in royal marriage and shipped away to a kingdom in turmoil, where her husband refuses to acknowledge her. Devastated, Elisa decides to take charge of her fate and learn what it means to bear the Godstone. As an invading army threatens to destroy her new home, everyone at court maneuvers to take advantage of the young princess. But how can a young girl who has never ridden horseback, never played the game of politics, and never attained the love of a man save the world?
