Enterprise education in vocational education : a comparative study between Italy and Australia
This article summarises a study of the purposefulness, structure and amount of external learning networks formed during an interdisciplinary higher education programme based on a LAB studio model. The LAB studio model is a learning model, which develops connections between working-life based problems and the recognition and development of the related business prototypes and startups. The LAB studio model is theoretically grounded in a constructivist view of learning with a project-based education at its core and has a key goal of educating entrepreneurship competences. The data for the study was collected through semi-structured interviews with six student teams (N=35) during May 2015. The data analysis took place through mixed methods, which as a method focuses on collecting, analysing, and mixing both quantitative and qualitative data. Findings show that the LAB studio model challenges and enables students to develop new learning networks external to the traditional university environment. New learning networks are created due to the demanding problem -solving process used in the teaching activities. Overall, the education programme broke down barriers between the education environment and external business environment through the establishment of learning networks. In conclusion, the learning networks formed during the education programme were wide-ranging, and the role of students was active and self-directive. Furthermore, we suggest that social capital was increased during the educational process.

"This book is based on a highly successful joint project between the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under the auspices of the Cambridge-MIT Institute. The project brings together communities of highly diverse individuals to share and learn how to be enterprising. It has run 17 times with the positive outcomes of not only training more enterprising individuals, but also building capacity in universities. The unique feature of this book is how it covers learning in enterprising skills, while at the same time builds capacity in such a way that the alumni themselves can take what they have learned for the benefit of others. Through this book, the authors intend to share what they have learnt and to transmit their passion for this program to others for personal development. Hopefully, others will then repeat this positive experience and make a difference to their respective institutions and communities"--Book jacket.

Teaching Entrepreneurship moves entrepreneurship education from the traditional process view to a practice-based approach and advocates teaching entrepreneurship using a portfolio of practices, which includes play, empathy, creation, experimentation, and reflection. Together these practices help students develop the competency to think and act entrepreneurially in order to create, find, and exploit opportunities of all kinds in a continuously changing and uncertain world. Divided into two parts, the book is written for those educators who want their students to develop a bias for action and who are willing to explore new approaches in their own classrooms. A set of 42 exercises with detailed teaching notes is also included to help educators effectively teach the practices in their curriculum. Entrepreneurship educators will find a great deal of useful knowledge in this volume, which provides relevant, targeted exercises for immediate application in the classroom.

The need for entrepreneurial mindset, skills and creativity in the future work-life will require the renewal of  pedagogical methods used. The studio based learning is one of the promising pedagogical methods enabling this change.  The LAB studio model, pre-incubator style studio education in Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Finland, develops  connections between work-life based problems and the recognition and development of the related business prototypes  and start-up companies. Projects, based on the given problems are medium for educating self-aware future professionals,  who will gain skills and attitude to work in interdisciplinary teams with entrepreneurial mindset. This article is a study by a  literature review of the recent higher education practices utilising studio model as pedagogical method in variety of  disciplines. The study will identify the common elements of entrepreneurship education and studio model practices  described in the literature. The findings of the study indicate that entrepreneurship as a concept is not sufficiently addressed  in the studio model literature; several similarities in the pedagogical principles between the LAB studio model and other  studio models; and that LAB studio model has several unique practices compared to other studio model educations.
