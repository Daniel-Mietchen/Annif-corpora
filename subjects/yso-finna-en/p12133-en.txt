Abstract: Gas-chromatography was used to determine the major fatty acid composition of the total lipids, and triglyceride and phospholipid fractions of the subcutaneous, liver, skeletal muscle, coronary and perinephric fats of 38 moose killed in northeastern Finnish Lapland in early and late winter 1967-1972...

Barbara Soros draws on the ancient wisdom of the Tibetan people to narrate the touching story of a young boy named Tenzin and the wounded musk deer he encounters in the woods. By paying heed to his dreams and to the needs of the animal he has rescued, Tenzin is able to cure the deer. But soon he discovers that he must learn one of the most important lessons of all: how to love deeply enough to let go. The lush, intricate illustrations evoke the emotional depth of this tale that encourages the Buddhist virtues of nonviolence, compassion and the rejection of materialism. / WorldCat.

Abstract: The history, present distribution and different movement patterns of the moose (Alces alces) in Europe were studied, mainly on the basis of the literature available. The moose has recently widened its range in Europe, especially to the north and south. The dispersal mechanism and distribution history, together with the uneven distribution of the winter food reserves available are concluded to be primarily responsible for the formation of the (long-distance) seasonal migrations of the moose.
