Metabolism and hindgut ecosystem in forage fed sedentary and athletic horses
Horses send out signals continuously about their health, well-being, nutrition and behaviour. The challenge for every horse owner and horse lover is how to interpret these signals and use them. Dutch vets and horse owners Menke Steenbergen and Jan Hulsen have drawn on their expertise and wide experience of horse owners to write Horse Signals: a richly illustrated guide on how to interpret the behaviour, posture and physical characteristics of individual animals and groups. When observing horses it is important not to jump to conclusions immediately, but instead always to ask yourself three questions: What do I see? Why has this happened? What does this mean?
