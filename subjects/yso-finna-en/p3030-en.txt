Guide for induction of warehouse employees at hub logistics automotive
Abstract: The purpose of this thesis project was to create a simplified guide/information kit to be used as support material for the induction and orientation of warehouse employees at the case company. The targets were a) to create a theoretical framework of which topics and contents should, in general, be included in a training program of warehouse employees, b) through benchmarking, to map out what kind of topics are included in the induction programs of the source companies, and what type of induction practices the companies have found useful, c) to collect information on the existing induction and orientation practices at the case company, d) apply the findings of theoretical and empirical research to create a rudimentary guide material to support the induction and orientation of warehouse employees at the case company, and, e) to make English translations of some work instructions and the employee handbook for the case company; this material was simultaneously used as additional source material for the research.      The theoretical research aimed to discover, through literary and online sources, which topics should be included in the induction program to support the work and workplace competences of the warehouse employees. In addition to the theoretical research, benchmarking was used to provide field information on the induction programs and practices in the source companies; this enabled the author to assess, which practices are useful, what the potential problems could be, and what issues should be kept in mind in planning an induction program and when assessing the outcome of the program. The benchmarking material consisted of written materials (e.g. induction program frameworks and checklists) provided by the source companies, and of the insights received during a discussion meeting.      The empirical research was carried out to find out, what induction and orientation practices were in use at the case company, and how the contents and the quality of the employee induction program were reviewed by supervisors and employees. The empirical research findings were obtained through discussion and interviews with the supervisors and employees, and a feedback summary of the training program was provided by the case company.      Based on the theoretical and empirical findings, a simple and easily updatable induction guide was created to be used as reference material to support the induction of warehouse employees at the case company.
