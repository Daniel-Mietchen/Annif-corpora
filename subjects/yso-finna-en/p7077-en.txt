This book is a practical resource for understanding and supporting children with different behavioral styles. The book explains how temperament traits combine to produce behavior and how environment, parenting style, and learning relate to temperament and behavior. Based on the author's research and work with more than 600 clinical cases, the book discusses temperament-related behavior problems that occur at different ages (from infancy through adolescence) and in various settings (home, school, child care, health care, and therapy). It provides specific strategies and techniques to address problematic situations and typical behavior problems that occur at each age and in different environments.
