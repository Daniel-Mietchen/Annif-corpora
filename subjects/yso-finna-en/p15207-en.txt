The object of investigation has at the present a wellness facility which is however out-dated and does not longer support the general appearance. Therefore, a new investment has to be done which will be assessed with regard to its conceptual, economic and financial viability. In particular, the economic and financial viability of the new SPA & wellness facility by itself had to be assessed, as this is the main criteria for the principal. The extent of the pre-feasibility study is a limited version compared to a regular feasibility study where the content is abridged and obtained market information might be sufficient for rejecting the venture but insufficient for decision-making. The pre-feasibility study was carried out between July 2010 and January 2011. The value date for all calculation within the pre-feasibility study is January 2011.    In order to carry out the project, first an initial business contact was made where information on all operated departments at the present was given and the according information on the new SPA & wellness facility was provided.    In a second step, a competitor and market research has been carried out. The market research was carried out by the use of a geomarketing software. The competitor analysis has been carried out by an internet and literature research.    In a third step, all past procedures and equivalent findings have been used in order to carry out the economic and financial calculations for the new SPA & wellness facility including calculations such as the operating statement of profit and loss, taxes depreciable, debt service, taxes and loss-carry-forward, cash flow in equity after debt services and taxes, residual value / value of continuation at end of year 15, after-tax / before-tax equity internal rate of return, equity investment pay-back period in nominal value of money, total investment pay-back period in nominal value of money, present value and net present value of equity, influences on other departments' net income before and after fixed amount allocation, investment and year-start balance and investment decision comparisons.    In a last step, the conceptual, economic and financial viability has been assessed by using a grading from "1" (the worst) to "5" (the best) by evaluating the internal leitmotif of the new venture and the comparison with benchmark figures. If judging the outcomes of the pre-feasibility study by the main criteria of the principal, the venture should be rejected.
