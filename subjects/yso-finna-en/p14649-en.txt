"Significant quantities of natural resources are illegally harvested and their proceeds laundered in the Asia-Pacific region, fostering corruption and undermining environmental governance. Much illegal exploitation and pollution occurs in countries with poor governance capacities, but much of the sale for profit and money laundering occurs in mature markets with well-developed governance capacities. This book explores ways to address illegal fishing and logging in Asia-Pacific region by the use of cooperative legal measures, particularly anti-money laundering and confiscation of proceeds techniques. Contributors to this volume cover themes including: the nature of transnational environmental crime; patterns in laundering of illicit fish and forest products; networks for distribution of illicit products; weaknesses in current systems for assurance of the legality of products; and international legal cooperation to enforce anti-money laundering laws in relation to illicit products. In considering these topics the book explores how the use of anti-money laundering measures and the seizure of criminal proceeds can be used as innovative policy options to combat transnational fishery and forestry crimes. The book will be of excellent use and interest to scholars and students of environmental law, criminal law, and practitioners in environmental conservation"--

"Over the last two decades, "green criminology" has emerged as a unique area of study, bringing together criminologists and sociologists from a wide range of research backgrounds and varying theoretical orientations. It spans the micro to the macro--from individual-level environmental crimes and victimization to business/corporate violations and state transgressions. There have been few attempts, however, to explicitly or implicitly integrate cultural criminology into green criminology (or vice versa).This book moves towards articulating a green cultural criminological perspective. Brisman and South examine existing overlapping research and offer a platform to support future excursions by green criminologists into cultural criminology's concern with media images and representations, consumerism and consumption, and resistance. At the same time, they offer an invitation to cultural criminologists to adopt a green view of the consumption landscape and the growth (and depictions) of environmental harms.Green Cultural Criminology is aimed at students, academics, criminologists and sociologists with an interest in green criminology and cultural criminology: two of the most exciting new areas in criminology today"--

Green Harms and Crimes was produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the European Group for the Study of Deviance and Social Control, and to pay tribute to Stan Cohen. The book presents discussions of the application of Cohen's theories alongside empirical contributions in the fields of critical and green criminology. Taken together, the authors address harms and crimes against the environment, as well as against human and nonhuman victims. Injustices produced by powers driving harmful practices, such as capitalism and consumerism, are analyzed from the perspectives of speciesism, environmental (in)justice, species (in)justice and ecological (in)justice - thus encompassing both human and animal rights. Specific topics in this important volume include: waste and corporate crimes, agribusiness and food crimes, illegal wildlife trafficking, species endangerment, political protest and its oppression by legal power institutions.
