This study focuses on practices of engagement and representation in North-South international partnerships, and in global and development education in Finland. The first objective was approached through a qualitative methodology involving document analyses, and interviews with northern and southern partners engaged in education sector partnerships in Zambia from 2003 to 2007. The second objective discusses challenges and possibilities for more ethical North-South partnerships in global and development education policies in Finland. This doctoral study report consists of four articles and a thesis summary. This study draws on three fields of scholarship: postcolonial studies, development studies and global and development education studies. Postcolonial theory is used selectively as a ‘tool for thinking’ that connects critical examinations of North-South engagements and representations with educational possibilities. The methodological framework consists of a combination of different qualitative methods including ethnography and content analysis of three sets of data: 1) 19 semi-structured theme interviews, 2) five open-ended narrative interviews and 3) selected Finnish global and development education policy documents. In the analysis of structures, narratives and relationships in educational partnerships in Zambia, this study outlines tensions and paradoxes that point to the need for more ethical practices that can move beyond hegemonic, ethnocentric and paternalistic patterns of representation and engagement in international development work. The study concludes that ethical engagements in North-South education sector partnerships require an approach that goes beyond individual skills, knowledge and competencies. The importance of systemic analyses of power and knowledge production, of acknowledging the historical and cultural referents that frame possibilities of understanding, and of acknowledging the complexities that are present in North-South engagements are emphasized. Furthermore, the importance of self-reflexivity is suggested as a starting point for understanding the limits of universalised forms of knowing to support ethical engagements.

"Concerns about the quality of teaching and learning in higher education have given rise to teacher development programs and centers around the world. This book investigates the challenges and complexities of creating instructional development programs for present and future academics. Using case studies from a variety of countries, including Estonia, Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom, it examines issues that are important for higher education researchers as well as for higher education managers. The book introduces different responses from around the world to the need to improve teaching in higher education, demonstrates many different ways success may be understood, and investigates what factors may influence the results of instructional development. Contributors use these factors, as well as those found in the related literature, to explain program success through theoretical frameworks. This book also provides input for higher-education managers by pointing out how the local context and both institutional and national policy-making may help or hinder the effective preparation of professors for their teaching responsibilities"--
