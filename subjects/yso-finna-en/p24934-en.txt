Roles of Wnt4/5a in germ cell differentiation and gonad development & ErbB4 in polarity of kidney epithelium
Summary: The two nuclear divisions in the germ tube of Anthracoidea limosa appear to be the first and second divisions of meiosis. It is estimated that six bivalents occur in metaphase. Three successive mitotic divisions following meiosis are described. Nuclear migration during mitotic prophase appears as a special feature of sporidial development in A. limosa.
