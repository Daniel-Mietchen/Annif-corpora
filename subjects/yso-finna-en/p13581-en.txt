The future governance of citizenship
"This timely and accessible text successfully introduces, theorises and practically applies emerging ideas which now increasingly underpin early years practice, that of 'playful learning' and 'playful pedagogies'. By drawing upon observation, interviews and filmed material in their study of play environments, Pat Broadhead and Andy Burt offer accessible insights into key theories as well bringing together their wealth of skills and knowledge to provide numerous ideas for practical application in classroom or early years settings. In both indoor and outdoor environments, the text explores 'open-ended role play', (or 'the whatever you want it to be place') and illustrates how themes in children's play reflect their interests, experiences, knowledge gained at home and cultural heritage. By showing how children become familiar and skilful within open-ended play environments, the authors have seen the children's co-operative skills develop over time as they become connected communities of learners. This book also demonstrates how interested parents can become when involved in playful learning. Parents' knowledge and understanding, alongside that of the educators', helps to build a bridge between home and school that makes playful learning a universally understood experience by all adults involved with the child. This insightful text will be of interest to students of early years education, early years practitioners, and researchers"-- Provided by publisher.
