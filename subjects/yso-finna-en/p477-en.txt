Organizational entry
Every company these days, regardless of the field of business they operate in, is looking for the most talented employees. They also strive to get the best possible results from their recruiting process by attracting and recruiting the best talents. At the same time they want the process to be cost-efficient and relatively quick. Traditionally-used recruiting methods include advertising in different newspapers and magazines, as well as word-of-mouth recruiting. The Internet has become a new channel for recruiting; it's open 24 hours a day, seven days week. Nowadays companies are also increasingly planning their recruitment strategies in ways so that both the print media and the Internet support each other in this process. This thesis focuses on a comparison of recruitment communication and strategies of the three largest law firms in Finland; CastreÃÅn & Snellman, Hannes Snellman and Roschier. As all three are in direct competition with each other, the main focus is on analyzing their online recruiting communications and marketing. Emphasis is also given to an examination of the overall recruiting process and if the companies' internal marketing strategies become clear from looking at their homepages. This research does not examine advertising in the print media; it looks only at online recruiting. The primary objective set for this research was to find out how each company has utilized the possibilities offered by the Internet, as well as too see how these companies differ in their online communication and to find out if perhaps the law firms are not as homogenous in their external communications as is commonly thought.

Fundamentals of human resource management
Personnel selection is changing. Whilst traditional face-to-face interviews are still common, the range of assessment processes that inform the selection of candidates is increasingly diverse, taking advantage not only of new technologies, but also using new methods and strategies, such as assessment centres and personality testing. This new collection looks at the most important contemporary issues in recruitment, selection and assessment today, highlighting the latest research from the perspective of both recruiter and applicant.
The thesis studies recruitment and centralised recruitment. The aim of the study is to investigate what type of recruitment process models or process model parts Kesko Group should apply and why. Kesko Group's Corporate HR is currently studying different recruitment model options in order to develop their recruitment model which at the moment is decentralised. Kesko Group's development need leans toward centralised recruitment but also decentralised processes and process models are being considered. The theoretical framework focuses on describing a recruitment process in general and concepts related to centralised recruitment, such as outsourcing, HR service centres and recruitment quality measures. The aspect of employer branding and its connection to recruitment are also discussed. Moreover, the study aims to take into consideration other research related to the field of recruitment, such as the influence of the economy on recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the service industry. The framework was built by studying human resource and recruitment literature and existing recruitment research. The empirical study was conducted in qualitative research by interviewing corporate recruitment managers at ISS Services and Itella Corporation. The interviews were face- to face interviews in which the interviewees answered open- ended questions sent to them before hand. The interview results indicated that both companies that, similar to Kesko Group, recruit mostly customer service personnel have some level of centralised recruitment. The conducted study supports Kesko Corporation's plans to develop Kesko Group's recruitment by centralising recruitment operations. Based on the research Kesko Corporation should consider implementing a centralised recruitment model or recruitment model parts managed by non outsourced recruitment consultants. This would support ensuring the acquirement of professional workforce in a cost efficient manner that would also support employer branding.

This thesis first presents HR House Group Oy, a temporary staffing and recruitment service. The company is targeting potential Russian-speaking employees. Hence the researcher works on marketing the organization to the future employees. The thesis is about marketing management. It focuses on branding the company in order to get a totally new employee segment. The researcher is involved in the recruitment processes of the company. The study helps to understand how the whole system works. Both marketing and HR (Human Resouces) departments are involved in the analysis, but the main focus is on marketing. The theoretical part deals with marketing communication and integrated marketing communication. Promotion is described in more detail with the help of social events and job fairs that the company participated in. Using social media and the Internet web pages are some of the other branding tools that are discussed in the thesis. Moreover, the marketing of the company is presented from the international and cultural points of view. The research is based on a quantitative methods. An online-survey and open questions were used to gather data. Online surveys offered multiple-choice answers and supplementary questions required open answers. Some thirty people participated in both of the data collection types. The respondents were chosen very carefully. All of them have dissimilar professions, education and therefore contrary opinions and attitudes towards employement in Finland. However there is one very important thing they all have in common: they all speak Russian. Their answers help to define both challenges and advantages of getting jobs in Finland for a Russian-speaking job hunter and help to understand where people look for jobs. As a result, their point of views help to find the right approach toward potential employees from the company's perspective.

Executive search, headhunting, is now one of the archetypal new knowledge intensive professional services, as well as a labor market intermediary bound up with globalization. In this book, the authors examine the key actors in the process of executive search globalizatio-- leading global firms--and offer an interpretation of the forces producing the contemporary organizational strategies of global executive search. The Globalization of Executive Search documents the forms of institutional work that have legitimated the role of executive in elite labor markets and created demand for the services of global firms; this exposes not only the changing geographies of executive search, but also how executive search has established itself as a new knowledge intensive professional service. The authors reveal how the globalization of executive search is exemplary of the processes by which a range of new knowledge intensive professional services have come to be globally recognized, approaching the heart of contemporary capitalism"-- "This book examines the globalization of executive search. After examining the changing geographies of global executive search firms, the book uses the case of executive search to document the institutional work involved in legitimating, globalizing and creating demand for the services of new knowledge intensive professional services"--

"Succeed by mastering the art of the who Why surround yourself with the best? Because it matters-in all aspects of life. In fact, in professional environments, getting people right-what global leadership authority Claudio Fernandez-Araoz calls "the art of great; who' decisions"-marks the difference between success and failure. To thrive, you need to identify those with the highest potential, get them in your corner and on your team, and help them grow. Yet surprisingly very few of us are able to meet that challenge. This series of short and engaging essays outlines the obstacles to great "who" decisions and offers solutions to address them in a systematic way. Drawing from several decades of experience in global executive search and talent development, as well as the latest management and psychology research, Fernandez-Araoz offers wisdom and practical advice to improve the choices we make about employees and mentors, business partners and friends, top corporate leaders and even elected officials. The personal stories and cutting-edge studies described in the book will help you understand both your own failings and the external forces commonly at play in staffing decisions. The author shares concrete recommendations on how to select the best people, bring out their strengths, foster collective greatness in the groups you've assembled, and create not only better organizations but also a better society. Starting with the cases of Amazon pioneer Jeff Bezos and Brazilian tycoon Roger Agnelli and continuing with individual and corporate examples from around the world, Fernandez-Araoz paints a vivid picture of what great "who" decisions look like and presents a fresh and commanding argument about why they matter more than ever today.
