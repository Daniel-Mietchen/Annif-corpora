Understanding the film : an introduction to film appreciation
"Becoming an effective filmmaker involves being deliberately mindful of the structures and conventions that allow film to communicate meaning to a global audience. The Language of Film explores complex topics such as semiotics, narrative, intertextuality, ideology and the aesthetics of film in a clear and straightforward style, enabling you to apply these ideas and techniques to your own analysis or film-making. With full-colour film stills, in-depth case studies and a wide range of practical exercises, The Language of Film will help you to make the transition from consumer to practitioner - from someone who just responds to the language of film, to someone who actively uses it. In the second edition, a new chapter examines how sound contributes to narrative and space to tell stories, create imaginary worlds and shape the realist (and often non-realist) effect of cinema. Along with two case studies from the first edition, Seven (dir: David Fincher) and Citizen Kane (dir: Orson Welles), the second edition also includes five new case studies: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (dir: Ben Stiller), Dead Man's Shoes (dir: Shane Meadows), Hero (dir: Yimou Zhang), Berberian Sound Studio (d: Peter Strickland) and Psycho (d: Alfred Hitchcock)"--

Elements of film
"The first half of this book is devoted to teaching a systemized approach that can be used to design the very best moving shot for any dialogue scene, no matter how complex or long. Bettman's "Five Task" approach enables the aspiring director to quickly grasp this difficult element of directorial craft. In the second half the reader is taught how to shoot action sequences using moving and static cameras and the gamut of lenses to achieve the magic trick essential to shooting action -- making stunts that are highly controlled and neither violent nor dangerous look completely mind-blowing.
