The Cistercians in Scandinavia
This book examines the role Augustine of Hippo (354-430) played in shaping the mystical thought of two twelfth-century monastic authors, the early Cistercians Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153) and William of St. Thierry (c. 1080-1148). The main contribution of this study lies in the fact that for the first time the mystical theologies of the two Cistercian monks are studied comparatively in a comprehensive way and in the light of what is most likely their major source, the theology of the bishop of Hippo. This study demonstrates in a more conclusive way than the previous research on the subject which are the similarities and differences between the mystical theologies of the two twelfth- century monks and intimate friends and at the same time brings more evidence for their reading and use of the works of Augustine in the articulation of their own thought.
