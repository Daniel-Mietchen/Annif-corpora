Program Theory in Evaluation Practice is a reference that teaches how to develop an explicit causal model that links an intervention (project, program or policy) with its intended or observed impacts and using this to guide monitoring and evaluation. Peerless in its explanation of why and how to use and develop program theory, the book is rich with examples and alternative approaches.

This step-by-step guide provides encouragement, support and direction for librarians who may be new to research and evaluation, or lacking in confidence or expertise. With a focus on practice based research, evaluation, and small projects it guides the reader through the research process from starting to think about the research question, through to the completion of the research and dissemination of the results. It is designed to encourage quality research from library professionals and encourage them to add to the evidence base in this sector. The book is structured into three parts: getting started; doing the research; and the impact of your research. Written by experts in the field, this timely edited collection considers methods and approaches that are suitable in a health library context, making it a useful tool for health library professionals and students alike.

This paper applies new panel estimation techniques to the estimation of the elasticity of private production with respect to public capital in a regional setup. We use the widely applied production function approach and regional data from Finland in the period of 1975-2004. In contrast to many previous studies about the productivity of public capital, we focus especially on panel estimation techniques. We show that the results from commonly applied fixed effects OLS are probably biased and sensitive to change of an estimator. To get more reliable results, we use the panel DOLS and panel DSUR estimators.
