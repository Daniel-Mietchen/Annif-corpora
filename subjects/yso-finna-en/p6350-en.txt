"Tired of the all the digital filmmaking guidebooks that give you only the nuts and bolts of how to use a camera? The third edition of Video Shooter takes the how-to knowledge a step further by showing you how to craft a story in your video. Barry Braverman is an experienced shooter and filmmaker whose is highly regarded in the field. This book covers everything from framing a shot, to lighting, to the type of camera (and tripod) you should use, and perhaps most importantly--how to translate the use of all the equipment and techniques into a story. The author is a veteran cinematic storyteller, and he shares practiced film-style techniques for use on your own DV cam.Humorous and opinionated, the author provides anecdotes and full-color illustrations that help you to learn the tricks of the trade. He gets right to the point of what you need to know to get good shots-and on a budget. New to this edition: * more up-to-date techniques involving HD technology* more coverage on the multi-skillset required of today's filmmakers (who are asked to act simultaneously as Director, Director of Photography, Cinematographer, Sound Recordists, etc.)*Website including craft tips, equipment review/blogs, and a teacher's corner to support use of the book in film studies/digital media class (includes student work completed in class using the text)"--

""Instant photography at the push of a button!" During the 1960s and '70s, Polaroid was the coolest technology company on earth. Like Apple, it was an innovation machine that cranked out one must-have product after another. Led by its own visionary genius founder, Edwin Land, Polaroid grew from a 1937 garage start-up into a billion-dollar pop-culture phenomenon. Instant tells the remarkable tale of Land's one-of-a-kind invention-from Polaroid's first instant camera to hit the market in 1948, to its meteoric rise in popularity and adoption by artists such as Ansel Adams, Andy Warhol, and Chuck Close, to the company's dramatic decline into bankruptcy in the late '90s and its unlikely resurrection in the digital age. Instant is both an inspiring tale of American ingenuity and a cautionary business tale about the perils of companies that lose their creative edge."

Photography was invented in 1839 and changed the way the people saw the world around them. The groundbreaking tool that brought the chemistry and optics together to make photography possible was the camera. During the nineteenth century cameras were mainly owned by professionals or self-educated entrepreneurs. As the technology improved, demand grew from ordinary people for affordable cameras. No longer solely the preserve of commercial photographic studios, cameras were now designed to target new markets: children, women, the snapshooter, the amateur and the professional, alongside specialized and scientific applications such as aerial photography, military use and spying. By the 1950s, electrical features such as battery-controlled shutters and exposure processes had become the norm, leading the way for the computer-run functions in the high-spec models of the 1970s. The arrival of commercially viable digital cameras, which recorded an image on a CCD sensor rather than film from the early 1980s, transformed the camera to a fully electronic device. By the mid-2000s digital cameras were outselling film cameras, and in 2012 six times as many smartphone cameras were sold than digital cameras. This book relates the exciting story of this groundbreaking tool by selecting fifty key camera models and investigating them in chronological order. The origin and development of each model is described in detail, along with its impact on the science, consumption and art of photography. This book is an excellent resource for students of the history of photography, curators of photographic equipment and technophile photographers.
