property development
In this publication the author Wim Vroom describes how in the Middle Ages the building costs of European cathedrals was financed. This policy of financing was as large and monumental as the cathedrals themselves. The money came from the diocese, the chapter, sometimes the sovereign and from the city. The main costs however were financed by the diocese to which the catherdral to be built belonged. Besides the financing the author treats the building and the changing circumstances in planning and praxis. Special attention is being paid to the financing of the Utrecht cathedral and in short the Cathedral of Sint Peter in Rome.
