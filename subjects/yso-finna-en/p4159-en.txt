Risk-based meat inspection in a Nordic context
Summary: While the FAO recognizes that genetic engineering has the potential to help increase production and productivity in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, it is also mindful of concerns about the potential risks posed by certain aspects of modern biotechnology, including effects on human and animal health and possible environmental consequences. This training package is composed of three parts: Principles of safety assessment of foods derived from recombined-DNA plants, Tools and technique for trainers, and Case Studies. It is also includes a CD-ROM containing the visual aids and other relevant reference material. After the completion of training based in this tool, recipients will be able to plan and deliver GM food safety assessment training for food safety authorities, regulators and scientists as part of their own national training programs.--Publisher's description.

The importance of securing a safe and wholesome food supply is receiving more attention than ever before. Although the fish industry has been at the forefront of implementing food quality and safety regulations and programmes, the availability and harmonization of scientific information related to the safety and quality of fishery products require improvement. And with increasing demands and higher standards facing the food industry, there is a growing need for special programmes to help developing countries implement new international instruments.

"You've seen the headlines: Parmesan cheese made from sawdust. Lobster rolls containing no lobster at all. Extra virgin olive oil that isn't. Fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets. Food journalist Larry Olmsted exposes the pervasive and dangerous fraud perpetrated on consumers by bringing readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing the alarming truth: What we think we're eating is not what we're really eating. This shocking deception extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It's a massive bait and switch where counterfeiting is rampant and where the consumer ultimately pays the price. Olmstead travels to the sources of the real stuff, to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and enjoy. Genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft."
