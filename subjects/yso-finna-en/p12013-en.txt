Barbara Soros draws on the ancient wisdom of the Tibetan people to narrate the touching story of a young boy named Tenzin and the wounded musk deer he encounters in the woods. By paying heed to his dreams and to the needs of the animal he has rescued, Tenzin is able to cure the deer. But soon he discovers that he must learn one of the most important lessons of all: how to love deeply enough to let go. The lush, intricate illustrations evoke the emotional depth of this tale that encourages the Buddhist virtues of nonviolence, compassion and the rejection of materialism. / WorldCat.

In an age of global threats to human health - including, most devastatingly, HIV and AIDS - it is time for Christians to ask: What is the role of faith in healing? This volume, forged in Africans' experience with HIV, searches for a new and positive Christian perspective on healing, rooted in biblical traditions, yet informed by contemporary medicine and pastoral care. Tensions created by faith healing practices, the spread of anti-retroviral therapy, the healing traditions of African indigenous religions, the advent of a new generation facing HIV, and the variety of Christian approaches to sickness and health - all come into consideration as theologians, pastors, historians of religion, and others address the most existentially pressing issue for the church in Africa. An invaluable guide to the situation and possibilities in African Christians' battle against HIV, In the Name of Jesus! is also a profound encounter with the wellsprings of Christian relevance to the human future.
