Abstract: Has Valkea Marina succeeded in its marketing communications? : Case study examining has a Finnish real estate company reached its clients through its marketing communications and should the company change its marketing communications for the future. The purpose of this thesis was to examine a Finnish/Spanish real estate agency Valkea Marina's marketing communications. The research was designed to identify the type of marketing communications Valkea Marina utilises, to discover whether those marketing communications strategies have been profitable, and to analyse ways Valkea Marina can improve its marketing communications in order to increase profits. The research was conducted in two dimensions: secondary research and primary research. The former included research of a large variety of marketing communications literature concerning theories about buyer behaviour, marketing communications planning, and different marketing communications tools such as personal selling, public relations and direct marketing. The latter included designing a survey for Valkea Marina's clients and interviewing the owner of the company in order to compare the results together and to find out areas of improvement. This study revealed that Valkea Marina has been using mostly personal selling, direct marketing and public relations as its marketing communications and it has been able to reach clients. However, this study found out that Valkea Marina's marketing communications lacked consistency and their website did not offer enough information for their customers. The company was advised to create a marketing communications plan, which would enhance their marketing communications by providing thorough and uniform guidelines for the personnel.

The objective of the thesis is to study how a live commercial can grab cinema audience's attention in a positive way. A live commercial done for Fazer's Dumle chocolates in January 2009 was studied. This was the first live commercial in Finnish movie theatres. Hence, recommendations for future live commercials are an important part of the research. The theoretical framework was based on literature about sales promotions, especially non-price promotions. The research method was qualitative. Data was collected mainly with thematic interviews. First, industry experts were interviewed on non-price promotions. Themes from the theoretical framework were applied to a local context. Second, the same industry experts and other stakeholders were interviewed with thematic interviews regarding the Dumle live commercial. Case study was applied to studying the live commercial case. Its documentation included also questionnaire responses from eight moviegoers, a press release and a promotion report on the case. The results indicated that a live commercial can grab cinema audience's attention in a positive way. Sampling was seen as a good addition to the live commercial. Important circumstances to take into consideration were identified and recommendations for future live commercials were made. The results were compared to an outside attention-value study made of the Dumle live commercial, and the attention-value study's results supported the findings of the thesis research. In conclusion, live commercials can be recommended as an inventive way to grab movie audience's attention to a brand, as long as the product is suitable for the target group and the circumstances are right.
