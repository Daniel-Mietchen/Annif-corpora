"Until now, numerical modelling of geodynamic processes has been the domain of highly trained mathematicians with long experience of numerical and computational techniques. Now, for the first time, students and new researchers in the Earth Sciences can learn the basic theory and applications from a single, accessible reference text. Assuming only minimal prerequisite mathematical training (simple linear algebra and derivatives) the author provides a solid grounding in the basic mathematical theory and techniques, including continuum mechanics and partial differential equations, before introducing key numerical and modelling methods. Eight well-documented and state-of-the-art visco-elasto-plastic, 2D models are then presented, which allowrobustmodelling of key dynamic processes such as subduction, lithospheric extension, collision, slab break-off, intrusion emplacement, mantle convection and planetary core formation. Incorporating 47 practical exercises and 67MATLABexamples (forwhich codes are available online at www.cambridge.org/gerya) this textbook provides a userfriendly introduction for graduate courses or self-study, and encourages readers to experiment with geodynamic models first hand"--Provided by publisher.

This book provides a complete description of the processes needed to take raw GPR data all the way to the construction of subsurface images. The book provides an introduction to the theory of GPR by using a simulator that shows how radar profiles across simple model structures look and provides many examples so that the complexity of radar signatures can be understood. The book continues with a review of the necessary radargram signal processes needed along with examples. The most comprehensive methodology to construct subsurface images from either coarsely spaced data using interpolation or from dense data from multi-channel equipment and 3D volume generation is presented. Advanced imaging solutions such as overlay analysis are introduced and numerous worldwide site case histories are shown. The authors present their studies in away that most technical and non-technical users of the equipment will find it useful for implementing in their own subsurface investigations.

Geophysics is used in dealing with problems from academic to practical interest. Applications can include, an understanding the structure of the Earth, resource exploration, environmental and construction concerns, as well as archaeology, palaeontology, law enforcement, and counter-terrorism. The nature of this science make inaccessible to all but those with rigorous training in mathematics and physics. While there are a great many publications in geophysics at various levels, none has been directed towards those that have a professional need to know about the geophysical techniques or are simply curious. This book was written with that particular audience in mind. Although its fundamental focus is on archaeological applications, it is sufficiently broad to be useful as a reference to support other applications and is sufficiently self-contained to serve as an introductory text. With the numerous application of geophysics comes a multiplicity of geophysical techniques that support each application. This book addresses geophysical techniques that are most commonly employed in near-surface application; those used in probing the underground to a depth of about ten meters. Each technique is covered at multiple levels beginning with elementary discussions that call upon every-day intuitive insights, with subtleties explored in greater depth. For each method considered, there are a number of case studies that serve to illustrate, the range of applicability of the technique and how this type of data is interpreted. In addition, these case studies have been selected to be of popular interest. One aspect stressed in this book is that, for a given application, there is not necessarily a single geophysical technique that can completely characterize the Earth's shallow subsurface. The synergism of multiple geophysical methods is emphasized by the inclusion of an integrated case study that continues from chapter to chapter demonstrating the increased understanding associated with addition of information from each newly presented technique.
