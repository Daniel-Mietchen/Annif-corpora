How to feel confident on the dance floor - step by step! This third edition of Social Dance: Steps to Success teaches all the moves for 10 of the most popular dance styles. The first few learning steps in this book introduce the foundational skills and concepts needed for success on the dance floor. Each step is a smooth transition from the previous one and progresses from how posture and footwork affect balance, how to connect footwork with the music, adjust to a partner, make the transition between partner positions and create sequences from variations of each dance's specific rhythmic step pattern. It also explains why the concept or skill is important, indentifies the keys to correcting technique, helps dancers avoid common errors, and provides them with the drills to practice at their own pace.
