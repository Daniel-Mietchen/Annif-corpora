Impact of isolation method on the antioxidant activity of rapeseed meal phenolics
The goal of the project was to find a suitable, solid carrier material for a liquid manganese based catalyst. Because the catalyst in question has a liquid nature, a solid carrier is needed to create a granulated form of laundry detergent. The experimental part of the Bachelor  ́s thesis project was carried out in Rahu Catalytics technical team's laboratory in Leiden Bio Science Park, The Netherlands, during the autumn 2010.  The manganese based catalyst, 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, catalyzes hydrogen peroxide in bleaching reactions. The bleaching results of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by adding this metal transition catalyst into the bleaching solution. The project included experiment planning, set-up and implementation. The prospective solids were selected for the study on the basis of their good liquid carrying capacity. Eight silica, three zeolite and three clay materials were tested by their absorption, desorption and stability capability. The main method of testing was based on color change and whiteness determination with a spectrophotometer.  Valuable information about substance intake and release was gained. The silicas absorbed and released the catalyst most efficiently after a short period of storage, but problems with aging were encountered. Ethanol as a solvent in absorption increased the amount of catalyst absorbed in case of all solids, but this method did not affect the desorption capability favourably. Absorption made in water was considered the most favourable method. Although a perfectly suitable carrier material was not found, some interesting materials, e.g Silica 3 and Clay 2 could be studied further. The objective of the project was achieved by designing experiment set-up and performing characterization tests for candidate materials. Also gaining additional detailed information about the tested solids was succesful.
