T helper cells play a profound role in the adaptive immune response. Depending on the antigen, cytokine environment and co-stimulatory signals naїve T helper cells differentiate into distinct subsets, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. These subsets have their own specific tasks and disturbances in their balance can lead to disorders in the immune system, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies and asthma. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms of Th cell differentiation is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disorders. Such knowledge may lead to better ways of diagnosing and providing therapies for these diseases.  This thesis study is part of a larger research project of the Molecular Immunology Group and was carried out at the Turku Centre for Biotechnology during April and May 2010. The original goal of this study was to test a novel method, called mRNA transfection, in studying Th cells. However, the time reserved for this project was too short and therefore the aims of the study were changed and only a part of the original project was performed. The aim of this study was to generate plasmid constructs of four variants of the NFIL3 coding fragment (FLAG-DN-NFIL3, FLAG-NFIL3, DN-NFIL3, NFIL3) by cloning them to the pBluescriptRN3P plasmid vector. Also a construct of the GATA3 coding fragment and pBluescriptRN3P plasmid vector was generated to be used as a control in further functional studies. In addition, the correct constructs were to be linearized for further studies. The goal was to provide useful tools to help the research of Th cells. In this study basic methods of molecular biotechnology, such as DNA digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation and polymerase chain reaction, were used. During this study substantial, unexpected and time consuming problems occurred, which is somewhat typical of scientific research. Due to the faced challenges the original goals were not fully reached. Nevertheless, as a result three out of the five constructs were correctly generated and they can be utilized in further studies.
