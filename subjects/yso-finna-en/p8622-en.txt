Shardza Tashi Gyeltsen is one of the luminaries of the Bon tradition of Tibet and the master of the teachings of the Great Perfection. His works have become important references for the modern Bon tradition, even if, for some of this Tibetan school, he is associated with the movement known as 'New Bon'. This book argues that such a view is wrong.
