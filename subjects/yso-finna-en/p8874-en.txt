The Stuxnet worm changed the picture of cyber war from abstract to concrete in an undeniable way. This paper studies the implications of recent discovery of Stuxnet and other self-replicating cyber weapons. We describe the state of art in known cyber weaponry and extrapolate the requirements and attributes for potential weapons..

"Cyber operations is an emerging professional and academic field of interest, encompassing multiple disciplines associated with both technical and non-technical operations conducted in cyber space. This book importantly focuses on the non-technical aspects, such as policy, strategy and best practice. It presents both theoretical and practical approaches towards understanding the evolution of cyber operations. This volume provides a multidisciplinary examination of international trends, with contributions from scholars and high-profile practitioners working in the fields of cyber security, cyber warfare, and information management. It also takes an international approach to these issues, incorporating studies from a military (warfare) context as well as civilian (private industry) environments. Current and Emerging Trends in Cyber Operations is essential reading for policy makers, military personnel, private sector professionals and both senior scholars and students to understand current changes and new issues in cyber operations"--
One of the least understood countries in the world, North Korea has long been known for its repressive regime. Yet it is far from being an impenetrable black box. Media flows covertly into the country, and fault lines are appearing in the government's sealed informational borders. Drawing on deeply personal interviews with North Korean defectors from all walks of life, ranging from propaganda artists to diplomats, Jieun Baek tells the story of North Korea's information underground--the network of citizens who take extraordinary risks by circulating illicit content such as foreign films, television shows, soap operas, books, and encyclopedias. By fostering an awareness of life outside North Korea and enhancing cultural knowledge, the materials these citizens disseminate are affecting the social and political consciousness of a people, as well as their everyday lives. -- Website.

This book reviews the role that cyberwarfare plays in modern military operations--operations in which it has become almost impossible to separate cyberwarfare from traditional warfare. Key features include: incorporation of hands-on activities, relevant examples, and realistic exercises to prepare readers for their future careers; examination of the importance of information as a military asset, from the days of Sun Tzu and Julius Caesar to the present; discussion of cyberwarfare in light of the law of war and international conventions, and the new questions it is raising; a review of the various methods of attack used in recent years by both nation-state and nonstate actors; outlines of strategies for defending endpoints, networks, and data; offering of predictions on the future of cyberwarfare and its interaction with military doctrine; provision of fresh capabilities due to information drawn from the Snowden NSA leaks. --

Telecommunication is, and always has been, a political technology, as the timely flow of information is a vital instrument of power. This book examines the political history of telecommunications between 1851, the year the first telegraph cable linked France and Britain, and the end of World War II. Headrick argues that telecommunication gives people options, not orders. During periods of peace, cables and radio were, as many had predicted, instruments of peace; in times of tension, they became instruments of politics, tools for rival interests, and weapons of war. The book illuminates the political aspects of information technology: the speed of telegraphy, which could diffuse conflicts in far-flung empires, but which also hastened the deterioration of diplomacy on the brink of the First World War; the broad coverage of radio, which increased public knowledge and public pressure on governments, and consequently the political interest in controlling news; and the security of telecommunications, which made communications strategy, communications intelligence, and cryptography decisive tools during the two World Wars.
"This book is a multi-disciplinary analysis of cyber warfare, featuring contributions by leading experts from a mixture of academic and professional backgrounds. Cyber warfare, meaning inter-state cyber aggression, is an increasingly important emerging phenomenon in international relations, with state-orchestrated (or apparently state-orchestrated) computer network attacks occurring in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008) and Iran (2010). This method of waging warfare - given its potential to, for example, make planes fall from the sky or cause nuclear power plants to melt down - has the capacity to be as devastating as any conventional means of conducting armed conflict. Every state in the world now has a cyber-defence programme and over 120 states also have a cyber-attack programme. While the amount of literature on cyber warfare is growing within disciplines, our understanding of the subject has been limited by a lack of cross-disciplinary approaches. In response, this book, drawn from the fields of computer science, military strategy, international law, political science and military ethics, provides a critical overview of cyber warfare for those approaching the topic from whatever angle. Chapters consider the emergence of the phenomena of cyber warfare in international affairs; what cyber-attacks are from a technological standpoint; the extent to which cyber-attacks can be attributed to state actors; the strategic value and danger posed by cyber conflict; the legal regulation of cyber-attacks as part of an on-going armed conflict and the ethical implications of cyber warfare. This book will be of great interest to students of cyber war, cyber security, military ethics, international law, security studies and IR in general"--

Wars are now mediated in unprecedented ways and through a variety of communicative forms. Correspondingly, there is an increasing awareness among those involved in war of the need to gauge and manage what is communicated. Communicating War: Media, Memory and Military contextualises these developments by locating the emergence of recent wars and terrorist activity in a wider frame of global socio-political change, highlighting the social, political and historical aspects of 'communicating war'. This includes: the remembering and forgetting of wars through cultures of collective memory and media selectivity; the organization, practice and culture of media institutions in the mediation of war information; and the strategic use of information by military institutions and terrorist organizations in the execution of war and terrorist acts. Remaining sensitive to the complexities of conflict, the book moves beyond a focus on UK and US interventions and reflects upon the communication of war in relation to all forms of conflict, particularly terrorism and under reported civil conflicts. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, Communicating War: Memory, Media, Military will be of interest to students in journalism, media, war and peace studies, international relations and international politics. Contributors include practitioners from within the journalistic and military communities and international scholars from a broad range of social sciences: Stuart Allan, David Altheide, Chris Atton, Oliver Boyd-Barrett , Nico Carpentier, Neal Curtis, Richard Keeble, Andrew Hoskins, Makram Khoury-Machool, Sarah Maltby, Donald Matheson, Lara Pawson, Ron Schleifer, Martin Shaw, Angus Taverner, John Tulloch, Howard Tumber and Jeremy Tunstall.
