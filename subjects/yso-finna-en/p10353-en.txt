Marking a departure in our understanding of Christian views of the afterlife from 250 to 650 CE, The Ransom of the Soul explores a revolutionary shift in thinking about the fate of the soul that occurred around the time of Rome's fall. Peter Brown describes how this shift transformed the church's institutional relationship to money and set the stage for its domination of medieval society in the West. Early Christian doctrine held that the living and the dead, as equally sinful beings, needed each other in order to achieve redemption. The devotional intercessions of the living could tip the balance between heaven and hell for the deceased. In the third century, money began to play a decisive role in these practices, as wealthy Christians took ever more elaborate steps to protect their own souls and the souls of their loved ones in the afterlife. They secured privileged burial sites and made lavish donations to churches. By the seventh century, Europe was dotted with richly endowed monasteries and funerary chapels displaying in marble splendor the Christian devotion of the wealthy dead. In response to the growing influence of money, church doctrine concerning the afterlife evolved from speculation to firm reality, and personal wealth in the pursuit of redemption led to extraordinary feats of architecture and acts of generosity. But it also prompted stormy debates about money's proper use -- debates that resonated through the centuries and kept alive the fundamental question of how heaven and earth could be joined by human agency.

Barth and Schleiermacher on the doctrine of election : a systematic-theological comparison
Rabbinic Judaism, in its classical writings produced from the first through the seventh century of the Common Era, sets forth a theological system that is orderly and reliable. Responding to the generative dialectics of monotheism, Rabbinic Judaism systematically reveals the justice of the one and only God of all creation. Appealing to the truths of Scripture, the Rabbinic sages constructed a coherent theology, cogent structure, and logical system to reveal the justice of God. These writings identify what Judaism knows as the logos of God--the theology fully manifest in the Torah. This work make its contribution in seeing in the principal conceptions of Rabbinic Judaism a logos--a sustained, rigorous, coherent argument. A narrative story of the Rabbinic sages' theological system sounds remarkably familiar--the age-old story of God's justice (to which his mercy is integral), of humanity's relationship with god as a possessor of the power of will, and of humanity's sin and God's response. --Provided by publisher.

The margin of appreciation is a doctrine developed by the European Court of Human Rights that indicates the Court's willingness to limit its power of review and grant member states certain autonomy in fulfilling their duties under the European Convention on Human Rights. The first section of this article discusses the margin of appreciation doctrine in general. It begins by shortly presenting the history of the doctrine and its justification as proposed by relevant case law and literature. The two other main sections of this article discuss European consensus and proportionality, two other principles of interpretation used by the Court in its case law. The focus will be on their interplay with the margin of appreciation. The article also identifies prospective developments in the Court's jurisprudence.
