Special education is now an established part of public education in the United States by law and by custom. However, it is still widely misunderstood and continues to be dogged by controversies related to such things as categorization, grouping, assessment, placement, funding, instruction, and a variety of legal issues. The purpose of this 13-part, 57-chapter handbook is to help profile and bring greater clarity to this sprawling and growing field. To ensure consistency across the volume, chapter authors review and integrate existing research, identifying strengths and weaknesses, note gaps in the literature, and discuss implications for practice and future research. This book is an appropriate reference volume for anyone (researchers, scholars, graduate students, practitioners, policy makers, and parents) interested in the state of special education today: its research base, current issues and practices, and future trends. It is also appropriate as a textbook for graduate level courses in special eduction.

"Assistive technology for cognition is technology which can be used to enable, enhance or extend cognitive function. This book systematically examines how technologies can assist the cognitive function of people with brain impairment, with the potential to revolutionize rehabilitation. Technologies are reviewed which direct attention, remind, recognize, prompt and guide people through activities of daily living. Written by experts in neuropsychology and technology development, Assistive Technology for Cognition provides a comprehensive overview of the efficacy of technologies to assist people with brain impairments. Based on the framework provided by the International Classification of Function, each chapter covers a different cognitive function, namely, attention, memory, affect, perception, executive function, language, numeracy, sequencing and navigation, onto which existing and future assistive technologies for cognition are mapped. This structure provides in-depth research in an accessible way, and will allow practitioners to move from an assessment of cognitive deficits to the prescription of an appropriate assistive technology for cognition. The chapters also make suggestions for future developments.Assistive Technology for Cognition will be of great interest to clinicians and researchers working in brain injury rehabilitation, technology developers, and also to students in clinical psychology, neuropsychology and allied health disciplines"--
