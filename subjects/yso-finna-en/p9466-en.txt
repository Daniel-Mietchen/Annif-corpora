When it comes to the way business is carried out online, the earth beneath our feet is shifting right now - and shifting quickly. The one-size-fits-all approach is fast becoming obsolete. More and more businesses are learning that the more they tailor-make the messages they put on their sites, as well as how they interact with every single user, the more satisfied customers get - and the more they earn.

This Bachelor's thesis was commissioned by a firm called “IGO Toiminimi“ and the aim of it was to develop a web application to help both the company and private users to post and advertise cars they are selling, renting or exchanging. To develop this application few technologies and tools were used. They include PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap (to design the interface) and Sublime Text (as a source code editor). It was able to use these tools and technologies by integrating each other to give the desired output. As a result there is a working program that runs in a “localhost” server connection. Users can register and log in to the system in order to interact with the application. As it has not been tested on a real working server on a web, in future the development requires more options for the users for a better interaction with the system in a user friendly and easy way. More technologies might also need to be introduced for a faster and better outcome.

What we need is a systematic process for quickly vetting product ideas and raising our odds of success. That's the promise of Running Lean. In this inspiring book, Ash Maurya takes you through an exacting strategy for achieving a "product/market fit" for your fledgling venture, based on his own experience in building a wide array of product.

Abstract: Metadata driven data utilization in ecommerce solution. The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to develop a proof of concept with SharePoint for ecommerce site that uses search index to provide data. The study concentrated in evaluating features that are seen important in online commerce web sites and how their implementations would suffice in the application platform, which has seen little use in online commerce. As a result an ecommerce site that utilizes SharePoint 2013 features to fulfill common ecommerce site requirements as well as possible was created. The site uses search index as data provider for the customer site and it has a separate site for product administration that is indexed. The project required architectural research and understanding of metadata and its use in search services for creating queries and faceted navigation. The project application platform was found to include many metadata enhanced search functionalities. Ecommerce features were found existing and working but lacking for extensive use. As products are queried from search index there are insufficient information about user preferences or behavior for personalized product promotions. Missing shopping cart functionality was also noted. Search functions described in this project can be used to develop search-driven content utilization also with other content types.

This thesis project is focused on implementation of a multi-stock environment for the existing online shop of medium scale, describing new feature's design and implementation. When a customer buys a product in online shop, most probably there is already a predefined relationship shop – wholesaler. The shop is not even trying to look for alternatives. This behavior can be changed and there are good reasons to do it for the shops, having already several suppliers and planning to make agreements with new ones. New type of the shop, working in a multi-stock environment, is able to automatically detect better price for the product and try to receive it from the cheapest supplier. Having this new functionality available, shop can increase own profits or sell some products cheaper than competitors. Also the availability of product will increase and, therefore, number of cancelled orders will decrease.

This Project based thesis demonstrates with the use of screenshots how to create a working web store and how to place it online. It also underlines considerations that need to be applied whilst building a web store and the background processes and theory that was applied. URC is a business that will be established in the near future and requires an online presence through a web store. The goal of the project was to establish a basic web store model to present to URC. Theories behind web store design and general theories that applied to the topic were utilized to better understand the background behind the practice. The problem presented was that the company had no experience on how to establish a web store and thus the thesis project idea was commissioned by the company.  The benefits of the thesis project are that after reading the thesis a reader can understand how to create a web store or a website on their own via the use of an intermediary service provider, how to purchase a domain name, point services and some basic marketing tools and how to market the web store.

Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Social Media in Hospitality and Tourism / conference co-chairs and proceedings editors: Crotts, J., Magnini, V., and Zehrer, A.
With dramatic changes in consumer behaviour - from online shopping to the influence of social media - marketers are finding it harder than ever to coordinate, prioritize and integrate the latest interactive channels into their overall brand-building strategy. Despite hard evidence showing the importance of digital marketing, the emphasis often remains on traditional media, with the most common social media channels being used without centralized coordination or integration with a wider marketing and branding campaign. Multi-Channel Marketing Ecosystems examines a fundamental game changer for th.
