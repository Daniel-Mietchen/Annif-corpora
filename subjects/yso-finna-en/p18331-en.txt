The last decade has seen a transformation of journalism industries and the working lives of our journalists. Do the changes have the same impact everywhere? Do journalists today experience these changes as a pressure or as a possibility? Is something irrevocably lost from journalism with these changes? "Newsworkers" takes a broad range of European countries - North and South, East and West, big and small - comparing in each how journalism as work has been affected by the changes in journalism institutions. The book looks at three pertinent and topical questions: the role of technology in changing journalism work practice; the decline or not of professional values; and whether journalism is becoming more homogenous across national borders. Drawing on extensive and original research, the book provides a comprehensive picture of contemporary European journalism.

Practical Journalism: How to Write News introduces the beginner to the skills needed to become a journalist in the digital age. The book draws on interviews with dozens of working journalists. They share their thoughts on the profession and we watch them work - selecting stories, carrying out interviews and writing scripts. Most journalists believe they work ethically although few have set rules and others admit to being pressured to behave underhandedly. This book looks at how journalists can work more ethically and provides a guide for beginners.

Interviewing for Journalists details the central journalistic skill of how to ask the right question in the right way. It is a practical and concise guide for all print journalists - professionals, students and trainees - whether writing news stories or features for newspapers and periodicals. Interviewing for Journalists focuses on the many types of interviewing, from the routine street interview, vox pop and press conference to the interview used as the basis of an in-depth profile. Drawing on previously published material and featuring interviews with a number of successful writers and columnists, Interviewing for Journalists covers every stage of interviewing including research, planning and preparation, structuring questions, the vital importance of body language, how to get a vivid quote, checking material and editing it into various formats. Interviewing for Journalists includes: * a discussion about the significance and importance of the interview for journalism * advice on how to handle different interviewees such as politicians, celebrities and vulnerable people * how to carry out the telephone interview * tips on note-taking and recording methods including shorthand * a discussion of ethical, legal and professional issues such as libel, doorstepping, off-the-record briefings and the limits of editing * a glossary of journalistic terms and notes on further reading.
