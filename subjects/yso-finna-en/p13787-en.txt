Dwarves are brave, determined, hard-working, and enjoy a gamble. In Quartz, you and your fellow dwarves discover a new mine, rich with valuable crystals. Excited by the discovery, yoúve decided to make a wager. Whomever can extract and sell crystals for the most profit after five days will become owner of the mine! Beware though your "friends" will stop at nothing to win, and every swing of your trusty pickaxe risks uncovering more than just crystals. How deep will you dig, how far will you go, and how hard will you work to be the minés owner, in Quartź!
