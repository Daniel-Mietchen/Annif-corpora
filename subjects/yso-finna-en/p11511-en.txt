Among the issues explored in this text are the effects of heat, hydration, and cold in the thermal environment; diving, altitude training, and other pressure effects on the human system; and the influences that pollution and air quality have on exercise. The text also explores the microgravity (space) environment and chronobiological rhythms and their effects on exercise performance.

"See how to achieve stronger starts, more explosive turns, and faster times. Swimming Anatomy will show you how to improve your performance by increasing muscle strength and optimizing the efficiency of every stroke. The book includes 74 of the most effective swimming exercises, each with step-by-step descriptions and full-color anatomical illustrations highlighting the muscles in action." "Swimming Anatomy goes beyond exercises by placing you on the starting block, in the water, and into the throes of competition. Illustrations of the active muscles for starts, turns, and the four competitive strokes (freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, and backstroke) show you how each exercise is fundamentally linked to swimming performance."--BOOK JACKET.
