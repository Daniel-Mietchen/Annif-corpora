The paper analyzes the development in Russian-European Union trade in the transition.After a significant adjustment of the trade data, and a short overview of the general development in Russian trade, the author analyses the trade dynamics and the commodity composition of exports and imports, using 3 and 5-digit Standard International Trade Classification.The outcome of the analysis shows that although Russian exports since 1992 have increased in terms of variety, the development in manufacturing exports is disappointing, especially with regard to light manufacturing and consumer goods.And not surprisingly Russia reveals a comparative advantage in minerals and metals.The level of intra-industry trade between Russia and the EU remains low and there is no sign of an increase; the opposite pattern from that of the Central European countries.On the whole this study shows that there are no clear signs of changes to the structure of foreign trade between Russia and the EU, to some extent the result of the lack of restructuring in the Russian economy.  Keywords: Russia, European Union, foreign trade, revealed comparative advantage, intra-industry trade .

This paper examines the political economy of Estonian trade policy in the 1990s.Estonia is a unique case in the world economy, in that the country rapidly implemented unilateral free trade after regaining independence and sustained it right through the 1990s.We analyse the circumstances, interests, ideas and institutions that have shaped Estonian trade policy during the past decade.Our stress is on institutions, particularly the national decision-making setting for trade policy.Through this prism we try to understand how a free trade regime was implemented and sustained, and what this experience suggests for the feasibility of free trade elsewhere.We also look at the increasingly "multi-track' nature of Estonian trade policy through bilateral free trade agreements, WTO accession and, especially, the movement towards EU accession.Although the other trade policy tracks to some extent provide a lock-in for unilateral reforms, we argue that EU accession is undermining the simple, classical liberal trade policy regime that existed during the 1990s.

While the European Union and Russia are actively working to strengthen their relations, the challenge of effective cooperation can only be called problematic given the pressures faced by an expanding EU and the dynamics of present-day Russia.Nevertheless, the arguments for improving relations for both parties are overwhelming as closer ties ultimately promote the economic prosperity and political stability of the entire region. EU-Russian cooperation is presently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).The EU and Russia have also agreed to start discussions on creation of a free trade area. While the framework of cooperation is already in place, implementation of the PCA will demand greater resources than current capacity allows.Russia will bear the heaviest burden as it will have to develop functions longestablished in the EU.To ease this transition, the EU provides technical assistance to Russia through its Tacis programme and similar programmes.These constitute a good-faith commitment on the part of the EU to a functioning market economy, political democracy as well as a working system of education and social welfare in Russia. Both parties acknowledge the other's importance as a trading partner currently, trade mainly consits of oil, natural gas and refined metals exported by Russia and machinery and vechiles exported by the EU.The asymmetry of this relationship complicates competition and trade policy.Russia's competitive weaknesses in certain sectors make it very tempting to revert to protectionist pressures which will hinder liberalization of trade and potentially jeopardize the implementation of the PCA. Although critics have called attention to the excessive optimism and impracticalities of the PCA and Tacis, they nevertheless concede that their spirit embodies a willingness by both parties to promote better relations.And despite obvious areas of contention between the EU and Russia (especially in trade policies), there has been a consistent willingness to discuss positions and seek mutually acceptable solutions.Given the general complexity of EU-Russia relations, this willingness to sort things out will be fundamental to all future progress. Keywords: Russia, EU, integration, foreign trade, partnership and cooperation agreement .

The paper analyzes development of Sino-Russian trade in the period 1985-1995, considering both the general state of relations between the two countries and internal logic of transitional processes taking place in China and Russia. The authors start with an analysis of trade dynamics and a review of the commodity composition of exports and imports.The following sections deal with regional cooperation and border trade.On the basis of their analysis, the authors conclude that, in spite of problems, Sino-Russian trade for the period of 1985-1995 developed quite rapidly and still possesses the substantial potential for sustainable future growth. .

The principal motive behind writing this Bachelor’s thesis is to uncover the importing procedures of garments and related items from an Asian country (Bangladesh) to a European country (Finland). Finnish market situation is also observed in order to understand the demand of Bangladesh ready-made garments. In theoretical framework, materials for instances books, articles published in Internet and already written thesis have been used. Supervisor’s guidance in preparing this thesis has been an inevitable part. The market is cut throat competition and factors that are responsible in dragging the business down and promoting need be precisely comprehended. A part from competition issues, business venture needs to analyze the legal procedures, tax issues, corporate social responsibility and last but not the least customer satisfaction. The very basic concept of writing this thesis is to basically focus on issues on import procedure, customs duties, how a noncommunity products becomes a community products and gets free movement status, how shipment is done and who is responsible, the most risk free payment against goods, what can be legal treatment in case contract is breached. Theoretical framework is reinforced by empirical art of work and findings will be submitted to the stakeholders and general public those who are interested in international business. All business activities a company does is to satisfy the customer’s demand by adding higher value in the products thru different ways, bringing them in proper market and selling them in time. Most importantly, the customer’s trend is changing day by day and this trend may bring company’s success and failure. 21st century is the customers’ era as well as the hightech era. Business institutions want products, as early as possible in a named place so there is need of third party like Nefin Trading, that provides goods wherever and whenever it is felt necessary. Such company guarantees the quality of product and reasonable price. Furthermore, Nefin Trading is committed to complying with applicable law. As part of CSR, Nefin Trading is also determined to what it can do to keep the environment intact.

Challenges and opportunities of the new international trade agreements (Uruguay Round) for ESCWA member countries in selected sectors : agriculture under GATT and WTO, with special reference to Egypt
Prospects for Russias membership in the WTO now look better than any point since accession negotiations began almost a decade ago. Good progress with economic and legal reforms within Russia has left the countrys economy better prepared for membership. Nevertheless, the economy still suffers from various weaknesses including, but not limited to, pervasive subsidies for different sectors, lack of liberalization and foreign participation especially in the service sector, inefficiency in custom administration, lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights, etc.For all their sensitivity, the negotiations on the import tariff levels and access to the service sectors are the least of the problems.Much more difficult will be non-tariff barriers and the general trade-related legislative framework. Resolving the remaining weaknesses would be a complex process. However, given the importance of WTO-related measures for the overall domestic structural reform, any delay in accession would be at least marginally negative for investor perceptions of country risk. Key words: Russia, WTO, tariff, reform  JEL classification: F1, P2. .

Russia has cleared an important hurdle in its path to membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the signing of the bilateral agreement with the United States.It will still take some months at minimum to finalize Russian membership, and even longer for the effects of membership to be realized.Russia's progress in the WTO negotiations is an important positive sign for international actors of the country's willingness to further integrate with the global economy.Russia has committed to lowering its average import tariff on agricultural and industrial goods by 3 percentage points, but with transition periods.Russia will also liberalize its service sector, but still reserve the right to some restrictions.It is widely believed that WTO membership will have a positive impact on Russia's economic development by enhancing competition and efficiency in the economy and by increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Russia.Some fears have also been expressed on the ability of domestic companies to survive with the growing competitive pressure.The consequences of future membership will not, however, be dramatic or instantaneous.

To the surprise of many observers, the Russian economy began to show signs of growth within a few months of the August 1998 crisis. The depreciation of the rouble brought about extensive import substitution in the economy, and as a result, production of consumer goods, such as clothing, is rising briskly.Certain export-oriented sectors, such as non-ferrous metallurgy, also took off.Among the most encouraging aspects of the current Russian economy, the author notes growth in investments, machine building and certain high-tech industries.Even so, most Russian exports are still commodities.Thus, the author argues that economic sustainable recovery will require a shift in the export structure of Russian industry towards advanced, value-added products. Key words: Russian economy, economic growth, import substitution, foreign trade .

Challenges of the export process : Case Olvi Plc.
Trade with the USSR accounted for about 15 per cent of Finland's total exports in 1952-1990, peaking at more than a quarter in the early-to-mid 1980s.Such trade is routinely seen to have had a major beneficial impact on the Finnish economy, whether in terms of profitability, diversification or stability.At the same time, trade with the USSR is seen to have had a major negative impact on the economies of the Central European member countries of the CMEA. This paper discusses this paradox, looking at both the institutional arrangements of Finnish - Soviet trade and the available analytical evidence.Much research, however, still remains to be done. Key words: Finland - economic development, East - West trade, bilateralism, clearing. .

Finland is a small open economy, where fluctuations in exports and imports have shaped the big picture of developments in the economy. A historical review of these developments suggests that the current situation provides no such conditions for rapid export growth supporting the economy as those seen in the earlier growth phases of economic history. Despite facing difficulties, the forest industry is still one of the pillars of Finnish exports alongside the machinery and metal industry..
Up to the end of 1991, more than 90 % of Baltic trade was conducted with other parts of the Soviet Union, where trade was organized not on the basis of voluntary exchange but strictly guided by Moscow.The subsequent collapse of central planning caused widespread disruption in trade and financial links. Nevertheless, the Baltic countries, to a certain extent, retained their strong dependence on trade with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, and as a result saw their terms of trade decrease by 10-15 % of GDP.Further, they experienced high inflation, dramatic output declines, shortages of goods and raw materials, and dysfunctional payment and monetary arrangements.To correct this situation and avoid prolonged economic difficulties, Baltic trade links with the West were restored, as well as economic relations among the Baltic nations themselves. From the trade policy point of view, Estonia followed the most liberal course by eliminating trade restrictions altogether. Latvia and Lithuania have favoured more protectionist policies. Estonia and Latvia have consistently strived to boost their trade with the West, while Lithuania still maintains stronger trade relations with Russia. Despite the fact that the Baltic countries have a free trade agreement and numerous actions have been taken to promote intra-Baltic trade links, current problems at macro- and microeconomic level as well as trade policy differences constitute major obstacles to trade creation and greater cooperation among the Baltic states.Further, the smallness of the Baltic market and the general sameness of tradeable products tend to limit the possibilities for intraregional trade.As a consequence, growth in intraregional trade has remained quite modest. Keywords: foreign trade, integration, Baltic countries .

Facing the challenges in exporting in Russia
World trade grew for decades considerably faster than global GDP. In recent years, the growth of international trade has slowed to the level of the GDP growth rate. Is the most hectic phase of globalisation already history? It would seem that, in the latter part of the first post-millennium decade, it was for the most part permanent structural factors that took centre stage, while transitory cyclical factors played only a minor role. Forecasts suggest world trade growth relative to global GDP is not likely to gain significant momentum in the immediate years ahead..

Non-wood forest products of Laos : perspective of exports in 1988-1997
We study re-exports from Finland to Russia.Re-exported goods are defined as goods that are imported by a purchaser in one country who then exports the product to a third country without processing. Re-exports are a major driver behind recent growth of Finnish exports to Russia, with re-exports constituting over a quarter of Finnish exports to Russia in 2005.Re-exporting typically involves high-value products such as electronics and vehicles.Finland's involvement in such trade reflects the technically advanced nature of Finnish logistics and traditionally large transit streams through Finland to Russia.Other reasons for re-exports include Russia's vast market potential for Finnish trading companies, Finnish companies' special knowledge about Russian demand (asymmetric information), transfer pricing and grey schemes.The domestic income and employment effects of re-exports are similar to those of transit trade.Re-exports are highly cyclical, making long-term developments hard to predict.  Keywords: Russia, Finland, foreign trade, re-exports. .

In this decade, China's foreign trade has increased rapidly and the share of high-technology goods in China's exports has become outstanding. These developments are partly related to processing trade that reflects the global production fragmentation. This paper discusses the role of processing trade in China by using a concept of vertical specialization (VS). The paper explains approaches to estimate vertical specialization and evaluates the findings of recent research in this field. It seems evident that processing trade has played a major role behind the fast growth of Chinese exports and the increase of high-tech goods in its exports. Moreover, recent research seems to imply that China's and much of Asia's exports are still heavily dependent on American and European consumers and, consequently, exports are not de-coupled from the final demands in the United States or Europe.  Key words: China, vertical specialization, foreign trade, processing imports .
The 1990s have seen the delinking of the Baltic economies from Soviet industrial structures, rapid liberalization of local economies and foreign trade, and a burst of trade expansion. Estonia's exports, in particular, have grown consistently at a sufficiently high rate to bring about solid export-led growth for its economy.The article gives an overview of the changes that have taken place in the foreign trade of the Baltic countries, paying particular attention to Nordic-Baltic trade relations and possible future developments in trade. Underlying overall trade development, the Baltics' trade reorientation to the West has been profound and rapid, especially in Estonia's case.Russia and the other CIS members have been replaced by the EU as the Baltics' main trading partner.Latvia and Lithuania have reoriented themselves to the non-Nordic EU, while Estonian foreign trade is heavily concentrated on Finland and Sweden.Application of a gravity model of trade suggests (in contrast to results obtained for foreign trade of central and eastern European countries in transition) that the Baltic countries' foreign trade with a few European countries has exceeded its potential, in particular Finland and Sweden.The extreme is seen in Finnish exports to Estonia which have grown far larger than the estimated potential.The implication is a decline in the share of the two Nordic countries in the Baltics' foreign trade. The structure of Finnish and Swedish trade with the Baltic countries differs considerably from the structure of Finland's and Sweden's foreign trade in general.Trade is concentrated in resource- and labour-intensive goods, while intra-industry trade is less significant.Nordic-Baltic trade levels, above all Finnish-Estonian trade, have been influenced by a number factors in the opening up of the Baltic economies.These include proximity, lack of competition, free trade arrangements, intermediation of goods and, in Estonia's case, direct investment by Finnish and Swedish companies.A major identifiable element supporting the development of Estonian trade with Finland and Sweden is outward processing in the fields of textiles and machinery. In the medium and long run, the Baltic countries will have to tackle several wider issues influencing their external sector. These issues include the sustainability of competitiveness in the production of labour-intensive products in the face of efforts by other low-cost producers; the limits imposed by marginal natural resource wealth; the viability of commercial agriculture at such northern latitudes; the exploit ability of forest resources; and development of "east-west" transport/shipping gateways and production geared toward eastern markets.Scarcity of evident competitive advantages and uncertainty related to many fields emphasize two priorities, ie the maintenance of economic stability in terms of policy and institutions, and further investment in relatively well-educated populaces. Keywords: foreign trade, Baltic countries, Nordic countries. .

Analysis of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)
Foreign trade statistics based on value added follow the value added by each country and sector through the different phases of the production process. A new database maintained by the OECD and WTO provides a different picture of the imbalances in trade flows between the major economic regions and the interdependency of imports and exports than that provided by traditional customs statistics. This article also examines imbalances in euro area trade on a value-added basis. Statistics based on value added do not displace the traditional gross foreign trade statistics, but offer an alternative way to examine the importance of foreign trade, particularly for those countries that are integrated into global value chains. .

Russia is, with the exception of the USA, the single most important outside country for the European Union.Still, it just account for a few percentage points of EU global trade, even less of EU outward investment.The Union, on the other hand, accounts for about one half of Russia's foreign trade.The relation therefore is, though important, asymmetric. Institutionally the Union and Russia have been building their relation since the 1990's, but development was much enhanced by the northern and eastern enlargements of the Union on the one hand, and by Russia's "European Choice" as declared by President Putin. Still, developing the relation has not been simple, and in many instances this is caused by the underlying asymmetries of the relation.This paper outlines both the institutional and underlying economic basis of the relation and argues that it will remain a complicated one in the future as well.  Key words: European Union; European Neighbourhood Policy; Russia/EU relations. .

This paper examines the vertical price transmission of banana and orange prices in Finland using import and consumer price series from years 1998-2009. Considering the stationary behaviour of the price series, the dynamic relationship between import and consumer price is investigated by Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL) models and Error Correction Models (ECM). The results show that the vertical price transmission is symmetric both with banana and orange. However, the analysis concentrates on the speed of adjustment towards the equilibrium of prices. Due to linearity of the model it does not take into account the magnitude of the price change.

In this article, the quality of Russian import statistics is assessed by comparing them to corresponding export data from partner countries. While discrepancies between Russian import data and partner country export data have visibly diminished over the past decade, the quality of Russian import statistics is still slightly poorer than those produced by its peers. Discrepancies are more pronounced at the disaggregate level, and both magnitude and sign vary by partner country and product group. Some discrepancies can be explained by misclassification, while some apparently reflect deliberate misreporting.   Keywords: International trade statistics, mirror statistics, Russia .

India has frequently been referred to as the country with the largest economic growth potential in the world after China.Many commentators seem to think its role in the world economy is already comparable to that of China.However, a closer look at merchandise trade, market share developments, and foreign investment figures reveals that India is still far behind China as far as international influence is concerned.An interesting exception is services trade, where India already plays an important global role due to recent fast growth of offshore outsourcing.Despite of the vitality of this sector, its weight in the Indian as well as in the global economy is relatively small.In general, India's economy and economic policy are still relatively inward looking and it seems unlikely that India will become a major driver of the world economy in the current decade.However, depending on India's economic policy and reforms, the situation in the next decade may already be quite different.

The Baltic countries' changing foreign trade patterns and the  Nordic connection
Experience has shown that a basic prerequisite for successful mechanization of the agricultural sector requires a well-functioning supply chain. To draw lessons for achieving this goal, the FAO Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division commissioned three mechanization supply chain case studies. The studies were conducted in Kenya, Pakistan and Brazil and the information contained in them has been used as the basis for the analysis presented in this technical report. Historically, public sector efforts to supply mechanization services have often failed as costs greatly exceeded income and the maintenance of aging machinery fleets became too great a burden. However it is evident that the public sector does have a role to play in complementing the activities of the private sector in a synergistic partnership. The main role of the public sector is to have the vision of a national mechanization strategy and to cultivate an enabling environment which allows the private sector to operate effectively. One key possibility described in the report is that of linking equipment supply chains across continents. This is exemplified by an account of the evolution of no-till technology in Brazil which is now being successfully used by farmers in Asia and Africa. A key stakeholder in this supply chain development has been FAO in conjunction with the international donor community, as they have been in a position to take a holistic view to encourage private sector actors and so disseminate profitable mechanization technologies from one continent to another. The main recommendations of the technical report are aimed at policy makers in the public sector, although there is plenty of interest to other stakeholders, especially machinery suppliers and mechanization service providers. However the ultimate beneficiaries are small and medium scale farmers who are the recipients of the services provided.--Publisher's description.

Rivals beyond trade : America versus Japan in global competition
The study makes an effort to elaborate the question, how Russian political, geopolitical and economic dependencies and aspirations may influence transit transport flows related to the trade between the European Union and Russia, and on Russian decisions to invest in transport infrastructures.The factors influencing on the choice of export transit transport corridors range from a number of long-term economic and geo-political security considerations of the Russian energy sector to a short-term needs to exert pressures to gain political benefits.Thus, three factors seem to have a major impact on the direction and volume the transit transport: 1) Russian national geo-strategic security considerations aiming at the maintenance of economic autarchy and spheres of interest, 2) the structure of trade between the European Union and Russia, and 3) the unwillingness of Russia to purchase from the new border republics transit transport services, available for free during the FSU era.Finally, the study contains statistics on the volumes and values of the transit transport flows between the European Union and Russia by commodity groups and by corridors (Ukraine-Slovakia, Poland-Belarus, Lithuania-Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland). .
