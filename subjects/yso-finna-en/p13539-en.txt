Our success as a species is built on sociability, so shyness in humans should be an anomaly. But it's actually remarkably common - we all know what it's like to cringe in embarrassment, stand tongue-tied at the fringe of an unfamiliar group, or flush with humiliation if we suddenly become the unwelcome centre of attention. In 'Shrinking Violets', Joe Moran explores the hidden world of shyness, providing insights on everything from timidity in lemon sharks to the role of texting in Finnish love affairs.
While both positive and negative peer interactions have long been a focus of scientific interest, much less attention has been given to children who tend to refrain from interacting with others. What are the causes of shyness and social withdrawal? How do they affect development? Do solitary preschoolers grow up to be anxious adolescents? Addressing these and other critical questions, this volume brings together leading experts to present the latest ideas, findings, and applications in this growing area of research.
