This is the final thesis' work for a Master's degree in Business Administration in the branch of International Business Management. This thesis concerns the tourist industry field. One of its main objectives is about the competitive factors regarding the decision of choosing a tourist destination and, more exactly, of choosing Turku or Benalmádena. There is also another main objective and it is about the situation of our two target cities regarding some examples of the current trends in the tourist market. Also, and inside this objective, special attention has been paid to the changes in the tourists' profile, such as the increase in the average age or the today inevitable reality concerning the need of sustainability in the different aspects of the current society. A research towards the fulfilment of its aims has been done in these two rather different cities located in two countries that could clearly represent two very different positions and not only when thinking about their geographical locations. In order to follow this research from the most objective point of view, interviews have been conducted as a main source of data. These interviews have been developed in both cities involving professionals and consumers' perspectives. The results of this thesis are thought for the general public and, very especially, for the professionals of the sector. It deals about the two situations in the two target cities and it may be of interest for the reader in order to reach an even higher knowledge about them and compare the situations and experiences.
