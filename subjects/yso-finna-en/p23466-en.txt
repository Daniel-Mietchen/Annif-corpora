Well-being and elite sports : ten endurance elite athletes ÃÅperception of their most difficult times
This is the pioneering author's latest edition. Tudor Bompa pioneered many of the breakthroughs in modern training methods, proving long ago that it's not only how much and how hard an athlete works but also when and what work is done that determine an athlete's conditioning level. In this new edition of Periodization Training for Sports, he teams with strength and conditioning expert Carlo Buzzichelli to demonstrate how to use periodized workouts to peak at the optimal time. Coaches and athletes in 35 sports have at their fingertips a verified programme designed to produce the best results. Containing plenty of ready-made training schedules, the book is an excellent conditioning planner for those wanting to know what works, why it works and when it works, both in the training room and on the practice field.

After a decade-long addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol, Charlie Engle hit rock bottom after a near-fatal six-day binge ended in a hail of bullets. Then he found running, and it has helped keep him sober, focused and alive. He began to take on the most extreme endurance races, such as the 155-mile Gobi March, and developed a reputation as an inspirational speaker. However, after he made the documentary Running the Sahara, narrated by Matt Damon, which followed him on a 4500-mile crossing of the desert and helped raise $6 million, he was sent to prison after failing to complete his mortgage application properly. It was while he was in jail that he became known as 'The Running Man' as he pounded the prison yard, and soon his fellow inmates were joining him, finding new hope through running. Now, in his brilliantly written and powerful account, Engle tells the story of his life and how running has brought him so much pleasure and peace. Like such classics as Born to Runor Running with the Kenyans, this is a book that anyone who has ever found solace in the freedom of running will enjoy.
