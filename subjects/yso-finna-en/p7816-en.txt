"There is an ongoing and strong projectification of business and working life. This movement goes beyond traditional project organized sectors like construction, consultancy, media and entertainment. Project thinking is spreading to most parts of society including industrial enterprises, governmental organizations, educational institutions and volunteer groups. Not only do people relate to projects and to project organizing in their working lives, but they even speak and think of their daily activities in project terms. When faced with an institutional context shaped and embedded by an earlier, now by and large foregone Industrial Society, a shift towards Project Society can lead to frustration and problems may appear as a result of this imbalance"--

"In this book, leading authorities on project organizing explore the growing deployment of projects and other types of temporary organizations in business, with a focus on the challenges created by projectification. The way projects are coordinated and handled influences the success of innovation and change within organizations and is critical for strategic development in our societies, yet it is often at odds with the institutions of traditional industrial society. Drawing on both theoretical perspectives and real-world cases, this book sheds light on the transformation towards a project society and explores the effects, opportunities and conflicts it has created. As change continues, the authors make a case for renewing institutions and mindsets and provide a foundation from which to discuss societal changes for the future. This is an invaluable book for researchers and students in project management and organizational theory programs, as well as professionals involved in the management of projects"--
Doing research that is useful for theory and practice
"Some 20 years after the emergence of configurational theory as a key perspective in organization studies in the 1990s, this approach has yet to deliver on its promise. While we know that configurations the relative arrangement of parts and elements - matters, empirical research on configurations is just beginning to deliver on its promise." --Publisher's website.

Change is now so commonplace that people no longer talk in terms of the "whitewater epoch". Every sector of the economies of the developed world has experienced huge swathes of change in the last decade of the twentieth century alone. Increased global competition, aided and abetted by technological advances, has led many organizations to seek to re-invent themselves in the hope of being able to survive and thrive. In mature sectors in particular, where the pace of consolidation is accelerating, organizations have had little option but to grow through acquisition or be absorbed. Whether the change is labelled "continuous process improvement", "restructuring", "downsizing" or re-engineering", to employees, change usually brings with it added pressures, job insecurity and a consequent loss of commitment to the organization. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success argues that strategic change in the new millennium will be geared increasingly to achieving sustainable high performance, rather than just short-term gains. Most theorists now agree that the real challenge of change lies in gaining employees" willingness to commit to the change effort. Change leaders at every level need to be able to understand the elements at work in any change process, and to use judgement about the style of leadership required to give the change effort the best chance of success. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success provides an overview of change and organizational theory, leading in particular to the author"s definition of the "input" elements of the high performance organisation, based on extensive research into UK and international organisations. It also contains a section looking at the management of change, with case studies illustrating approaches to managing change which are conducive to achieving sustainable high performance. In her companion book, The High Performance Organization- creating dynamic stability, the author explores some of the "how to"s" of building an organizational culture which is supportive of high performance in today"s challenging environment.

Qualitative Inquiry in Higher Education Organization and Policy Research provides readers with the theoretical foundations and innovative perspectives for undertaking qualitative research to influence policy and practice discussions. Well-known chapter authors discuss innovative strategies for investigating complex problems, helping readers understand how research can consider the culture of the institution, administrative hierarchy, students, faculty, and external constituencies. From both an organizational and policy perspective, chapter pairings explore a range of methodologies, including ethnography, case study, critical qualitative inquiry, and the notion of "grit". This volume explores how qualitative inquiry can advance understanding of organizational inequities in higher education, and it offers graduate students and educational researchers the tools to improve the organizational function of institutions while contributing to meaningful change.

"Widely known as a leading intellectual, Zygmunt Bauman's thinking is often categorized as sociology or philosophy. But his work has been hugely influential in other fields as well, not least within organization studies. From increasing management control and growing standardization of work activities, to the increase in uncertainty and insecurity experienced by contemporary workers, organizations themselves are becoming ever more ephemeral entities. Bauman's themes: globalization, liquid modernity and postmodern ethics are arguably fundamental to contemporary notions of organization and management and his thinking has never been more relevant. However, despite the obvious and continuing influence of Bauman's ideas on business studies, there has been no comprehensive attempt to chart his impact on organization theory. In this innovative and insightful collection, an international selection of leading management scholars explore key topics in current organizational discourse, including networked organizations, control and ambiguity, technologies, work and responsibility, extending Bauman's liquid modernity to the "liquid organization". The book will be essential reading for scholars and academics and students in management and organizational theory, and also sociology, managing culture and organizational ethnography"--
Understanding change : theory, implementation and success
The mobile phone business is in transformation and so is Nokia as well. It means that rapid changes are needed almost constantly and it is affecting the employees more or less dramatically. Organizations are forced to change and more efficiency is wanted. These rapid changes need good management and strong personalities in charge who are able to coach the employees through the changes and without jeopardizing the performance too much. The purpose of this Thesis was to study the operational mode of the Nokia Salo Hardware organization before and after the big organizational change which took place in 2009. The research made before the organizational change gave a good background for the further research after the organizational change. The purpose was to study how the organizational change affected the job profiles of the employees, responsibilities, the working methods, the co-operation between different teams and information sharing. This Thesis was qualitative in nature and was conducted in close co-operation with the Salo Hardware organization. The research methods were interviews, group interviews, meetings, discussions and the literature overview. The research strategies used in the study were the survey research and case study research strategies. As results, there were some deficiencies found in the operation of the Salo Hardware organization. There were improvements needed at least in the information sharing, in the job profiles of the Project Managers, in the project organization structures and in the change management. Based on the results of this Thesis, new information sharing meetings were started and the job profiles of the project managers were made clearer along with the unified project organizations in Salo. The changes made based on this Thesis brought some more unity to the Salo Hardware organization and clarity after the dramatic organizational change.
