"Decolonizing Global Mental Health offers a critical postcolonial reading of this newly emerging arena, with a particular focus on psychology's and psychiatry's encounters with, and responses to, distress or 'mental illness' in low-income countries. The World Health Organisation and the Movement for Global Mental Health currently push for the 'scale-up' of psychiatric and psychological interventions on to low-income countries, modelled on those from high-income countries. However critiques of psychiatric and psychological services from service users, the survivor movement and professionals, often remain invisible within 'Global Mental Health' literature. This book argues that it is imperative to explore how this alternative 'evidence base' might be mobilized to fruitfully interrogate calls to 'scale up' psychiatric and psychological services in the majority world. The book seeks to de-familiarize current 'Western' conceptions of psychology and psychiatry using postcolonial theory, and seeks to bring into focus a series of questions and problematizations. As such it is ideal reading for undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers in the fields of critical psychology and psychiatry, social and health psychology, cultural studies, public health and social work"--

Designing and delivering dementia services
This was the bland phrase used to describe Luise’s sudden death in the psychiatric ward at Amager Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was 32. Dear Luise is a mother’s deeply personal account of her struggle to ensure her daughter’s survival through 20 years of treatment in the Danish mental health system. It is an alarming – and thoroughly documented – exposé of the abject failure of the medication-based treatment regimen routinely imposed on vulnerable psychiatric patients. This book is also a poignant tale of love and hope, brimming with tender memories of the creativity, originality and wry humor of a very capable, intelligent young woman.

"This book offers a critical post-colonial reading of the newly emerging arena of global mental health; with particular focus on psychology's and psychiatry's encounters with, and responses to, distress or 'mental illness' in low-income countries. The World Health Organisation and the Movement for Global Mental Health currently push for the 'scale-up' of psychiatric and psychological interventions onto low-income countries, modelled on those from high-income countries (such as the UK). However critiques of psychiatric and psychological services from service users, the survivor movement and professionals from many high-income countries, often remain invisible within 'Global Mental Health' literature. This book argues that it is imperative to explore how this alternative 'evidence base' might be mobilised to fruitfully interrogate calls to 'scale-up' psychiatric and psychological services in low-income countries.

Straight talking introduction to being a mental health service user
"Adolescence is a period of rapid growth, maturing individuality, vulnerabilities and fortitude. Fortunately, most youths go through this period of life in a healthy way, but some do not. Adolescent Mental Health: Prevention and Intervention is a concise and accessible overview of our current knowledge on effective treatment and prevention programs for youths who have developed, or are at risk of developing, mental health problems. Ogden and Hagen's introduction to "what works" in the promotion of adolescent mental health addresses some of the most common mental health problems among young people, and how these problems might be prevented or ameliorated through professional and systematic efforts. The volume illustrates contemporary and empirically supported interventions and prevention efforts through a series of case studies, and covers some of the most prevalent mental health conditions affecting today's youth; externalizing, internalizing and drug use problems. Within an ecological and transactional framework, the book discusses how psychopathologies may develop and the risks and protective factors associated with these. The problem-oriented perspective on risk and mental health problems is combined with a focus on social competence and other protective factors. Adolescent Mental Health: Prevention and Intervention will be essential reading for students and practitioners in the fields of child welfare and mental health services, and any professionals working with adolescents at risk of developing mental health problems"--

Vivid case studies illustrate best practice in person centred planning, and the authors offer a rich variety.
