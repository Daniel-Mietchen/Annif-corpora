This is a book about the journey of ideas among Italian women. Based on interviews, participant observation, and the writings produced by women in five different settings, Judith Adler Hellman traces the movement of feminism throughout Italy, from Turin and Milan, the great industrial cities of the North, to Reggio Emilia in the "red belt" of central Italy, to Verona in the deeply religious Northeast, and finally, to Caserta in the South. Following the development of Italian feminism from its origins in the turn-of-the-century Socialist Party into the 1980s, the author has gathered rich, first-hand accounts of participants that indicate the various ways that feminist thinking was received and reformulated by Italian women. In cities both large and small, cosmopolitan and provincial, Catholic and communist or socialist in their traditions, we see the impact of ideas, and the ways in which those ideas transformed and were, in turn, transformed by women acting within the constraints of their particular local social and political conditions. Hellman concludes with a broad analysis of the impact of feminism on the lives of the women she came to know, and on Italian society and politics as a whole.

Labor Activists and the New Working Class in China is an ethnographic work examining an export jewelry industrial district in Pearl River Delta of China. While well known that China is undergoing an unprecedented capitalist transformation, few have noted the new working class of China are also actively striving to alter their fate through labor struggles. Parry Leung lived for twelve months in the migrant worker dwelling sites, and kept close contact with the strike activists. Leung illuminates how strikes emerge and transform in an authoritarian state, by enhancing our understanding on the informal agency power of strike organizers in labor activism.
