"A radical guide for starting a revolutionary business, from the charismatic, unconventional co-founder of UK-based craft beer company BrewDog and cohost of EsquireTV's BREWDOGS. After practicing law for all of two weeks, James Watt walked out on his legal career to start BrewDog craft brewery with his best friend, Martin Dickie. They didn't do it with a business plan; they did it with a mission to revolutionize beer drinking in the UK, to put flavor back into beer glasses and make other people as passionate about craft beer as they are. Since 2007, BrewDog has become the fastest growing food and drink manufacturer in the UK, employing over 500 people, and shipping their award-winning BrewDog beer to over 50 countries, including the US. Watt is also the star of the BREWDOGS TV show, which airs on the Esquire Network. "--

"A book with more than 75 recipes from an internationally acclaimed chef/brewer duo dedicated to elevating and pairing beer with high-end dining. The debut book by Danish gypsy brewer Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs of the bar T rst, and Canadian chef Daniel Burns of the Michelin-starred restaurant Luksus -- both in a shared space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn where they elevate beer to the level of wine in fine dining. With a dialogue running throughout the book, Food & Beer examines the vision and philosophy of this duo at the forefront of a new gastronomic movement. With a stunning, bold aesthetic, the design will highlight the dual visions of the authors and the spaces -- T rst, which is more rustic and relaxed, and Luksus, which is more sleek and refined. Foreword by internationally renowned chef Ren e Redzepi, co-owner of Noma in Copenhagen." --
