The art of experimental interaction design
Creating art with mobile phones in public spaces is an emerging form of artistic expression. This dissertation investigates the design of mobile art applications for creating and sharing interactive art experiences in public spaces. It explores new ways of deploying mobile and ubiquitous computing for art making that fosters creativity and community. This is done by developing a series of novel prototype applications, with a focus on multimodal interfaces, that are put into use in authentic environments for validation by real people. The results of this research inform future design of new forms of artistic and social activity that may eventually become everyday actions of creative expression and exploration.

Summary: "This book investigates the notion of beauty in participatory art, an interdisciplinary form which necessitates the audience's participation, as often seen in interactive art and technology-driven media installations.Taking into consideration established theories of beauty from Plato, Hume, Kant, Mothersill, and Gadamer, Heinrich argues that the experience of beauty in participatory art demands a revised notion of beauty that accounts for the performative and ludic turn within various art forms and, in a broader sense, within a technology-saturated culture. Through case studies of participatory art, he provides an art-theoretical approach to rewriting the notion of beauty.These findings are applied to a broader context of media and design artefacts and testify to ongoing changes in our general understanding of beauty"--.

Thomas Hirschhorn's Deleuze monument was conceived for 'La beauté' in Avignon in 2000. It comprised four elements: a rock inscribed with a quotation, an altar, a monumental sculpture and a library including books by and about Deleuze. Located in the Cité Champfleury, outside Avignon's historical walls, Deleuze monument embodied Hirschhorn's desire to put his work 'in a difficult situation' between reality, politics and aesthetics, and marks a significant turning point in his approach to producing and maintaining public works"--P. 4 of cover.
