The Evolution of Insect Mating Systems by Thornhill and Alcock was one of the key texts that helped define modern behavioural ecology. Published in 1983, it has had a huge impact in shaping "adaptationist" approaches to the study of animal behaviour, ending up far more than the sum of its parts, and influencing the study of the evolution of reproductive behaviour far beyond the taxonomic remit of insects. While much in the original remains relevant today, our aim in this edited volume is to bring together some of world's leading insect researchers to bring the empirical and conceptual scope of the original book up to date. We explore the evolution of often complex forms of sex determination in insects, and the role of sexual selection in shaping the evolution of mating systems. Selection arising via male contest competition and female choice, both before and after copulation are discussed, as are the roles of parasites and pathogens in mediating the strength of sexual selection, and the role that parental care plays in successful reproduction.
Abstract: The nesting biology of pair of rough-legged buzzards in northeastern Finnish Lapland was studied in the continuous daylight of June and early July 1973 with the help of a field television system with remote control...

Abstract: Two observations of birds nestin in snow are reported. In northern finland a Capercaillie, Tetrao urogallus, and in western Finland an Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo, laid their eggs in the snow. All nine eggs laid by the Capercaillie hatched. The melting of the snow destroyed the Eagle Owls nest...

Bondar examines the sex lives of our animal cousins, which are fiendishly difficult, infinitely varied, and often violent. They involve razor sharp penises, murderous cannibals, and chemical warfare in an epic battle between the sexes. Like us, animals must first find the perfect partner. You think we have it tough? Try having to do it while being hunted down by predators, against a backdrop of unpredictable or life-threatening conditions. Then, sperm and egg must successfully meet. Can you imagine doing this when your partner is intent on killing you or when other disgruntled singles are determined to throw you off your game?
