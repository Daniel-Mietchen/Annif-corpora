This publication is about the kinds of ethically challenging situations and ethical  dilemmas faced by health and social professionals of all levels who provide care for people with dementia in care homes and hospital settings. It contains short stories based on typical situations which professional carers might encounter, along with exercises and appendices to encourage and facilitate ethical reflection, structured  guidance on how to tackle ethically challenging situations and commentaries from experts in the field of ethics as well as professional care. The publication should ideally be used in the context of professional care training (e.g. with moderated group discussions, professional guidance and role playing) and adapted to the different levels of education and experience of the readers. It doesn't provide ready-made answers but hopefully, in the context of ongoing professional training, it will contribute towards empowering and motivating health and social care professionals to provide ethical care, and tackling ethically challenging situations with more confidence, thereby contributing to the wellbeing of their clients, colleagues and themselves.

Ace of Hearts is a multi protagonist drama about four unconventional women of different ages. The women end up living in the same apartment building in a suburb of a big city. As the women's lives interconnect, they change each other's destinies. LANA, 32, tries to support herself by playing poker. She drinks too much, sleeps around and takes polaroid pictures of her random hook-ups. Lana lives on her sailboat, because she can't settle down. TINKA, 12, is a smart, plumb, bullied girl who spends her nights standing in front of a mirror, praying God to make her thin. Over-controlling ISABEL, 60, is trapped in her life. Her husband MIKE, 65, is kind but won't have sex with her anymore. Isabel misses her daughter, who never visits them and only talks with Mike on the phone. HARRIET, 64, is Lana's mother. She has just discovered she has Alzheimer's. She hasn't seen Lana in eight years. The story begins when Harriet, who lives in the same building as Isabel and Tinka, tries to drown herself in her bathtub. Isabel, who lives downstairs of Harriet, wakes up when a drop of water hits her face. Lana is alerted to come back home to her mother, because Harriet can no longer take care of things on her own. The water penetrates everything and reveals what's true. The women must face change and grow out of the life they have constructed for themselves. But growth is not painless: it's raw and confusing, but beautiful still.
