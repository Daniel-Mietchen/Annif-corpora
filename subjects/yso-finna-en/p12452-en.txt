Cultural adaptation : change and continuity among Thunder Bay Finns
Utopians and utilitarians : environment and economy in the Finnish-Canadian settlement of Sointula
Drawing on a vast range of new sources, including their own oral history interviews, Golubev and Takala have written the first major account in English of a most dramatic and revealing, yet still little-known, episode in twentieth-century history--the mass immigration of North American Finns to Soviet Karelia in the 1930s. Meticulously researched this volume offers powerful and moving insights into not only the causes and course of the immigration but also into the experiences of the migrants and the tragic fate that awaited many of them during the Stalinist repressions.
