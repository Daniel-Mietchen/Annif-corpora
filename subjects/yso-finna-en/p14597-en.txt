Methodism
Charles Wesley : poet and theologian
In search of the catholic spirit : Methodists and Roman Catholics in dialogue
This handbook maps the best scholarship in the rapidly developing field of methodist studies. The 42 included essays are representative of the voices of a new generation of international scholars, summarising and expanding on topical research, and considering where their work may lead methodist studies.
A Wesleyan-Holiness theology
This is a major new study of the daily life and spirituality of early Methodist men and women. Phyllis Mack challenges traditional, negative depictions of early Methodism through an analysis of a vast array of primary sources - prayers, pamphlets, hymns, diaries, recipes, private letters, accounts of dreams, rules for housekeeping - many of which have never been used before. She examines how ordinary men and women understood the seismic shift from the religious culture of the seventeenth century to the so-called 'disenchantment of the world' that developed out of the Enlightenment. She places particular emphasis on the experience of women, arguing that both their spirituality and their contributions to the movement were different from men's. This revisionist account sheds new light on how ordinary people understood their experience of religious conversion, marriage, worship, sexuality, friendship, and the supernatural, and what motivated them to travel the world as missionaries.
