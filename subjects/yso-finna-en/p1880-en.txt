Nonlinear ordinary differential equations : an introduction to dynamical systems
Statistical and mathematical methodologies are usually perceived by people working in food science as complex and difficult subjects, and most food scientists and professionals receive limited instruction in them. This hinders the implementation of statistical and mathematical methodologies in food science and limits the usability and application of these techniques for research that contains a large quantity of complex data. These statistical techniques are necessary for the development and evaluation of food products and processes. They are also important for studying mechanisms underlying different phenomena that may affect product quality or the unit operations in food development. Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Food Science and Technology offers accessible and practical information, suitable for readers across a range of knowledge levels and food-related disciplines, for applying statistical and mathematical technologies in food science. The book's, focus is on the application of complex methodologies which have been recently introduced in the field (managing physicochemical, chemical, theological, nutritional, and sensory data) and have proven to be extremely useful in characterizing new products and processes in the food industries. Theoretical explanations, practical examples and case studies ensure that this is an easy-to-follow and comprehensive text, not just a theoretical guide for non-statisticians. It will therefore be of value to all food science professionals with varying degrees of statistical skill, as well as researchers, undergraduate and graduate students. Book jacket.

Incorporates mixed-effects modeling techniques for more powerful and efficient methods This book presents current and effective nonparametric regression techniques for longitudinal data analysis and systematically investigates the incorporation of mixed-effects modeling techniques into various nonparametric regression models. The authors emphasize modeling ideas and inference methodologies, although some theoretical results for the justification of the proposed methods are presented. With its logical structure and organization, beginning with basic principles, the text develops the foundation needed to master advanced principles and applications. Following a brief overview, data examples from biomedical research studies are presented and point to the need for nonparametric regression analysis approaches. Next, the authors review mixed-effects models and nonparametric regression models, which are the two key building blocks of the proposed modeling techniques. The core section of the book consists of four chapters dedicated to the major nonparametric regression methods: local polynomial, regression spline, smoothing spline, and penalized spline. The next two chapters extend these modeling techniques to semiparametric and time varying coefficient models for longitudinal data analysis. The final chapter examines discrete longitudinal data modeling and analysis. Each chapter concludes with a summary that highlights key points and also provides bibliographic notes that point to additional sources for further study. Examples of data analysis from biomedical research are used to illustrate the methodologies contained throughout the book. Technical proofs are presented inseparate appendices. With its focus on solving problems, this is an excellent textbook for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in longitudinal data analysis. It is also recommended as a reference for biostatisticians and other theoretical and applied research statisticians with an interest in longitudinal data analysis. Not only do readers gain an understanding of the principles of various nonparametric regression methods, but they also gain a practical understanding of how to use the methods to tackle real-world problems.
