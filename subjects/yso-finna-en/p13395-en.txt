This thesis examines three different areas of water treatment technology: the application of organic peracids in wastewater treatment; the removal of organic residues from boiler make-up water; and the use of geopolymers as sorbents.The main advantages of peracids as alternative wastewater disinfectants are their effective antimicrobial properties and high oxidation power, as well the absence of harmful disinfection by-products after their use. Performic, peracetic and perpropionic acids were compared in laboratory-scale disinfection, oxidation and corrosion experiments. From the techno-economical point of view, performic acid proved to be the most effective disinfectant against E. coli and fecal enterococci. However, in the bisphenol-A oxidation experiments, no advantages compared to hydrogen peroxide use were observed. It was also determined that corrosion rates on stainless steel 316L were negligible, while carbon steel seemed unsuitable in terms of corrosion for use with peracids even in low concentrations.Organic compounds in the boiler plant water-steam cycle thermally decompose and form potentially corrosive species. Activated carbon filtration was confirmed to be a suitable method for the removal of organic residue from deionized boiler make-up water. No significant differences in terms of treatment efficiency between commercial activated carbons were observed. However, acid washing as a pre-treatment reduced the leaching of impurities from new carbon beds. Nevertheless, a mixed-bed ion exchanger was required to remove leached impurities, such as silica and sodium.Geopolymers, or amorphous analogues of zeolites, can be used as sorbents in the treatment of wastewater. Metakaolin and blast-furnace-slag geopolymers showed positive potential in the treatment of landfill leachate (NH4+ ) and mine effluent (Ni, As, Sb).^

Learning and Teaching with Geomedia provides a theoretical and practical introduction to a field explicitly aimed at secondary education. The first section consists of three scientific papers introducing the dimensions of the emerging geoinformation society. The second section of the book is specifically dedicated to teacher trainers and teachers. The introductory section provides an overview of the development of geomedia and envisions a roadmap of technological development ahead; a discussion of everyday geomedia applications and geomedia use; and, finally, pedagogical approaches using geomedia in secondary education. This section provides a broad foundation that does not argue in favor of a technological paradigm, but suggests that geomedia use in secondary education should be oriented at everyday life applications. The main section is devoted to exemplary learning environments that are ready to use, and easily transferable to local schools. While geoinformation technology is the basis of these learning environments, care has been taken to clearly identify conceptual approaches to these learning environments, and, therefore, make them less reliant on technology locally available. Many of these are easily applied without any further software or hardware other than a web browser and a mobile phone. The pedagogical background of these learning environments leads from science education and spatial thinking to learning environments that support an education for spatial citizenship, reflected geomedia use and communication with maps to successfully participate in society. The book is aimed at academics in the fields of pedagogy, geography and citizenship education, as well as those working in science education. The professional audiences addressed are teacher trainers at university departments, teachers in secondary schools and students in teacher
