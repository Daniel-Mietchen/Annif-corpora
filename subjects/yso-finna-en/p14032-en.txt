The purpose of the thesis was to analyze the digital audio signal, and turn it into a playable experience creating a new way of consuming and enjoying music. The end result was a game using audio signal as its main source of input for generating playable content. In the thesis audio signal analysis methods and signal characteristics were examined: how audio is processed and analyzed. It also examined and compared the possibilities of real-time audio signal processing and pre-calculated audio signal processing. It showed how to generate events from existing audio signals concentrating on audio music track analysis and processing. Several ways of combining and transforming audio signals into events for the game engine were implemented. As a generalization game engines work primarily based on events. Events are generated by the players, and by the game environment with the variables programmed into its state machine. The thesis focused on audio events while briefly exploring other game events. It was shown that by turning audio events into game events it is possible to create several types of actions where audio is used inside the game. The audio signal creates enemy patterns, transforms visual landscapes and changes overall speed and aggressiveness of the gaming experience. Since the CPU and GPU powers are limited resources, gaming is based heavily on optimizations and generating believable illusions. The sweet spot between audio events and the rest of the game mechanics was examined, e.g. how much intake the audio signal can produce and still maintain the game’s playability and fun factor. As a result a game utilizing audio driven events was built using open source tools and plug-ins for analyzing and combining audio signal data. How the game is programmed, how its logic works and how it is optimized for running inside Adobe Flash Platform were explained in the thesis. Complete game including all the source code was made available for download.
