visual literacy
Process drama and multiple literacies : addressing social, cultural, and ethical issues
"The importance of images and visual media in todays culture is changing what it means to be literate in the 21st century. Digital technologies have made it possible for almost anyone to create and share visual media. Yet the pervasiveness of images and visual media does not necessarily mean that individuals are able to critically view, use, and produce visual content. The ACRL Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education were developed to address these distinct characteristics of images and visual media. Based on those standards, this book provides librarians and instructors with the tools, strategies, and confidence to apply visual literacy in a library context. Readers will not only learn about ways to develop students visual literacy, but also how to use visual materials to make their instruction more engaging. Ideal for the busy librarian who needs ideas, activities, and teaching strategies that are ready to implement, this book shows how to challenge students to delve into finding images, using images in the research process, interpreting and analyzing images, creating visual communications, and using visual content ethically; provides ready-to-go learning activities for engaging critically with visual materials; offers tools and techniques for increasing ones own visual literacy confidence; and gives strategies for integrating, engaging with and advocating for visual literacy in libraries. With this books guidance, academic professionals can help students master visual literacy, a key competency in todays media-saturated world, while also enlivening instruction with visual materials."

"The term 'Multiliteracies' was coined in 1994 by the New London Group, a group of scholars who came together to consider the current state and possible future of literacy pedagogy. In the subsequent years, the influence of the idea has been greater than the members of the group could ever have imagined. In this collection, two of the original members of the group, Bill Cope and Mary Kalantzis, have brought together a representative range of authors, each of whom has been involved in the application of the pedagogy of Multiliteracies, in settings as broadly dispersed as Australia, Canada, Greece, Malaysia, Italy, Japan, South Africa and the United States. The chapters capture vivid narratives of school experiences and offer insights into the role of the new, digital media platforms such as online lesson planning, resource development, and classroom delivery, making this book an invaluable resource for Multiliteracies practitioners and researchers alike"--

This second edition of the landmark textbook "Reading Images" builds on its reputation as the first systematic and comprehensive account of the grammar of visual design.

In this timely new book, Christopher Paul analyzes how the words we use to talk about video games and the structures that are produced within games shape a particular way of gaming by focusing on how games create meaning, lead to identification and division, persuade, and circulate ideas. Paul examines the broader social discourse about gaming, including: the way players are socialized into games; the impact of the lingering association of video games as kid's toys; the dynamics within specific games (including Grand Theft Auto and EA Sports Games); and the ways in which players participate in shaping the discourse of games, demonstrated through examples like the reward system of World of Warcraft and the development of theorycraft. Overall, this book illustrates how video games are shaped by words, design and play; all of which are negotiated, ongoing practices among the designers, players, and society that construct the discourse of video games.
The new edition of Gillian Rose's critical introduction to the study and analysis of visual culture has been fully revised and updated.

Doing visual research
The photographic image in digital culture
We live in a world awash in images. The recent technological revolutions in video recording, editing. and distribution are more akin to the development of movable type than any other such revolution in the last 500 years. And yet we are not popularly cognizant of or conversant with the grammar of visual communication, the coded messages of its style, and the practical components of its production. We are largely, in a word, illiterate. But this is not a gloomy diagnosis of the collapse of civilization; rather, it is a celebration of the progress we've made and a plan to seize its potential. Now is the time, Apkon argues, to transform the way we teach, create, and communicate so that we can all step forward together into a rich and stimulating future.--From publisher description.
