"Crimes against humanity were one of the three crimes elaborated in the Nuremberg Charter. However, unlike genocide and war crimes, they were never set out in a comprehensive international convention. This book represents an effort to complete the Nuremberg legacy by filling this gap. It contains a complete text of a specialized draft convention on crimes against humanity in English and in French, and fifteen original papers written by leading experts on international criminal law. The papers contain reflections on various aspects of crimes against humanity, including gender crimes, universal jurisdiction, the history of codification efforts, the responsibility to protect, ethnic cleansing, peace and justice dilemmas, amnesties and immunities, the jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals, the definition of the crime in customary international law, the ICC definition, the architecture of international criminal justice, modes of criminal participation, crimes against humanity and terrorism, and the inter-state enforcement regime".

"A wide-ranging, powerful, alternative vision of the history of the United States and how the slave-breeding industry shaped it. The American Slave Coast tells the horrific story of how the slavery business in the United States made the reproductive labor of "breeding women" essential to the expansion of the nation. The book shows how slaves' children, and their children's children, were human savings accounts that were the basis of money and credit. This was so deeply embedded in the economy of the slave states that it could only be decommissioned by Emancipation, achieved through the bloodiest war in the history of the United States. The American Slave Coast is an alternative history of the United States that presents the slavery business, as well as familiar historical figures and events, in a revealing new light"--

This book examines critical challenges in achieving accountability for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, focussing in particular on the relationship between national and international accountability mechanisms in pursuing key goals over the past decade. The essays in this volume provide an in-depth look at the goals and mechanisms of accountability in a variety of cases: the former Yugoslavia; Rwanda; Sierra Leone; Cambodia; Argentina and El Salvador; East Timor and Indonesia; and Belgium's prosecution of war crimes under its universal jurisdiction law. By analyzing the goals pursued in each case, the relationship between domestic and international mechanisms, the relative emphasis on criminal and non-criminal forms of accountability, and the effectiveness of the chosen approaches, this volume offers important lessons for the ICC and highlights the continuing need for innovative forms of international assistance to advance specific accountability goals in particular countries.
