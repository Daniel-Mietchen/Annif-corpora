Oulu UAS educates professionals for the needs of Northern Finland, whose competence corresponds to the needs and development of working life in the region. We react quickly to the changes occurring in working life and the requirements of new competence.    At the degree programme of Information Technology we aim to develop our teaching to include more real-life project work: our curricula include increasingly more company-related projects. This way we are able to provide our students with a more realistic view of the everyday work at companies, and also improve their employment opportunities.    The purpose of this publication is to spread the word about the projects and results achieved by the students and staff of the Information Technology department. In addition to student projects, our department is also involved in many domestic and international projects well worth mentioning. Yearly, our students complete hundreds of thesis and project work. This publication also presents good examples of our successful projects.

This book examines the changing roles of the librarian and how working within a rich digital environment has impacted on the ability of professionals to develop the appropriate 'know how', skills, knowledge and behaviours required in order to operate effectively. Expert specialists and opinion makers from around the world discuss the challenges and successes of adapting existing practices, introducing new services and working with new partners in an environment that no longer recognises traditional boundaries and demarcation of roles. The book is structured thematically, with a focus on three key strands where the impact of digital technologies is significant: * Communication - looks at how mobile devices are being used by LIS to enhance communication between services, staff, students and other stakeholder groups and investigates the extent to which LIS have successfully incorporated social media in their approach to managing customer enquiries. * Teaching and Learning - examines the role of the librarian in engaging with, supporting and training Generation Y researchers in adapting to changing scholarly practices brought about by digitally rich research environment. * Service Innovation - investigates the impact of the digital on collection management and user choice, the design and management of learning spaces to integrate mobile technologies and the impact this has on how librarians work within the space and support users in their effective use of technologies for communication, sharing and learning. Readership: Librarians, library schools, departments of information science and other professional groups such as education developers, learning technologists and IT specialists.
