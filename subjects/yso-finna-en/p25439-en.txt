Needs must : a very rock 'n' roll life story
"Brian Case has taken live ammo to an Al Pacino interview, ingested horse tranquillizers with Ian Dury, reluctantly hit the road with the Sex Pistols ('Idiots!') and interviewed Miles Davis in a totally blacked-out room. He is a critically acclaimed novelist and journalist who has written for NME, The Times, Uncut and Time Out among many others. In a series of conversations, Brian offers vivid recollections of some of his most memorable encounters. On the Snap is a thrilling glimpse of a disappering after-midnight world, all delivered with the sharp, speedy insight of a great raconteur."
