Strategies for the green economy : opportunities and challenges in the new world of business
When it comes to perceptions of what is a sustainable economy and how it may be realised, companies expanding into Central and Eastern European markets face the challenge of diverse people, attitudes and history. Corporate Social Performance in Emerging Markets provides an effective tool for companies to help them engage in CSR activities and become a responsible company in CEE countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. It does this by enabling them to focus on the difference of stakeholders and their attitudes to those of Western Europe.The author, Zsofia Lakatos, provides a review of the major differences between the various CEE countries, supported by interview research from leading executives in some of the blue-chip companies already operating in the region.

Reframing strategic corporate responsibility : from economic instrumentalism and stakeholder thinking to awareness and sustainable development
"Provocative new management principles and practices that create effective organizations for shareholders and society. Management experts Lawler and Worley have developed a set of management principles that enable organizations to be both successful and responsible. Existing command & control and high-involvement management styles depend too much on stable conditions and focus too narrowly on economic outcomes. They convincingly argue that we need to "reset" our approach to management to one that fits today's demanding business environment. Starting with a change in how success is measured and a more realistic view of risk, Lawler and Worley take us through how strategy, governance, organization structure and talent should be managed. The result is an organization that can reliable produce financial, social, and ecological results. Includes illustrative lessons from Microsoft, Cisco, Netflix, DaVita, Starbucks, Nokia, and the U.S. Secret Service. Offers clear prescriptions for managers who want to organize for sustainable performance effectiveness. Lawler and Worley are the authors of the bestselling Built to Change. Lawler and Worley outline why and how the current practice of management must change in order for organizations to achieve sustained organizational effectiveness."--
Strategic management and business policy : toward global sustainability
As the era of ever expanding markets and ample resources ends, governments and business will have to behave differently. The world is facing weak economic growth, limits to affordable resources and increasing concerns about environmental consequences. During the boom times, governments championed de-regulation and business responded by adopting an anything-goes attitude. In these straitened times, strategic analysis has to engage with the challenges that society faces to create resilient corporations fit for the 21st century.In Corporate strategy in the Age of Responsibility, Peter McManners, who has for nine years run strategy workshops on the Henley MBA focusing on the global business environment, sets about providing a strategic framework for navigating the new economic environment. Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs) now exist, but they struggle to find the strategic rationale for the improvements they champion. The author argues that their good intentions often lack traction, partly because others in management don't get it, but also because they are not ambitious enough. The book is not about preaching semi-charitable behaviour or how to enhance the reputation of the corporation instead it is about surviving and thriving in a challenging and changing environment. A corporate audience familiar with strategy books will relate to this book, but will find it steers them towards radically new strategic thinking suitable for a turbulent period of transition.

Organizing for sustainability
Things that are good for the planet are also good for business. Numerous studies from the likes of the Economist Intelligence Unit, Harvard, MIT Sloan, and others indicate that organizations that commit to goals of zero waste, zero harmful emissions, and zero use of nonrenewable resources clearly outperform their competition. Like lean thinking, greening your business is not just a 'nice to have'; at least not anymore. It is now a key economic driver for many forward looking firms. This book is packed with case studies and examples that illustrate how leading firms use lean and green as simultaneous sources of inspiration in various sectors of industry - from automotive and retail to textile and brewing. Take Toyota as an example, the holy grail of economic efficiency for decades. This book, shows that Toyota tops the green chart too, describing Toyota's notion of Monozukuri: sustainable manufacturing. Creating a Lean and Green Business System: Techniques for Improving Profits and Sustainability offers opportunities for innovation that can simultaneously reduce dependence on natural resources and enhance global prosperity.

Current methodology and future challenges of protected area planning and management frameworks
In recent years, corporations of all sizes and orientations have become more sensitive to social issues and stakeholder concerns, and they are collectively striving to become better corporate citizens (in some cases, urged on by shareholder pressure or government regulations). The best practices in corporate sustainability are no longer the exclusive domain of companies like Ben & Jerry's or Body Shop as they were a decade ago; now, large, multi-national companies like G.E. and Wal-Mart are leading the way with significant financial and organizational commitments to social and environmental issues. To help managers and academics keep their eye on the ever-moving target of sustainability, award-winning author and academic Marc Epstein's provides an authoritative and comprehensive guide to implementing corporate sustainability initiatives and to measuring both their social and financial impacts.
