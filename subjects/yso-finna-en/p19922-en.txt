"Preface to the student: We think that the theory dealing with what is hard about computation (and what is impossible!) is challenging but fun. This book grows out of these ideas, and our approach to teaching a course in computational complexity. There is no doubt that some of the material in these chapters is what might be called "wrap your brain around it" material, where a first reaction might be that the authors are pulling off a trick like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. For instance, consider the proof - using proof by contradiction - that there can be no algorithm to tell whether a program written in C++ will go into an infinite loop. One reaction upon reaching the contradiction at the end of the proof might be that there must be a misstep somewhere in the proof; another might be that there cannot really be a contradiction. Only after reading, rereading, and carefully considering each step can the student buy in to the proof. There are no shortcuts here; this is not reading to be done with the television playing in the background".

Introduction to coding and information theory
In the calculation of economic aggregates it is often necessary to compute the value of these aggregates in some relevant subgroups as well as for the whole data. A method of calculation is said to be consistent in aggregation if it gives the same result regardless of whether it is applied directly to the whole data or to subaggregates calculated using the same method. The property has been well studied, yet a satisfactory general definition has been lacking. In this paper a definition of consistency in aggregation is given for a general class of aggregation rules. We show that any aggregation method satisfying this definition has a representation based on a commutative semigroup operation. Also, as an application we use algebraic methods to derive certain properties of index numbers satisfying consistency in aggregation. In particular, we show that any such index number formula is in fact a generalized weighted mean.

This text is an introduction to ergodic theory, developing the machinery of conditional measures and expectations, mixing, and recurrence. Beginning by developing the basics of ergodic theory and progressing to describe some recent applications to number theory, this book goes beyond the standard texts in this topic. Applications include Weyl's polynomial equidistribution theorem, the ergodic proof of Szemeredi's theorem, the connection between the continued fraction map and the modular surface, and a proof of the equidistribution of horocycle orbits. Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory will appeal to mathematicians with some standard background in measure theory and functional analysis. No background in ergodic theory or Lie theory is assumed, and a number of exercises and hints to problems are included, making this the perfect companion for graduate students and researchers in ergodic theory, homogenous dynamics or number theory.
Elasticity and plasticity : The mathematical theory of elasticity
"This book originated from a course on quantum computing designed for an audience of varied experience, backgrounds and qualifications. Not assuming that the readers have advanced knowledge of information theory or quantum mechanics or linear algebra, this introductory text book provides a lucid introduction to the rapidly developing field of quantum computing and quantum communication, rigorously proving all mathematical sentences".
