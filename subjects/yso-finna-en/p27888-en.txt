a"Key Issues in Health and Social Care" is a learning resource for students in health and social care. It provides an overview of foundational issues and core themes in the field and introduces key areas of debate, moving from an introductory level to in-depth discussion as the book progresses. Divided into three parts: the first part sets the scene, addressing introductory psychology and sociology, social policy, equality and diversity, skills for practice, and working with people the second part considers key themes such as the contribution of philosophy and politics; criminal justice; management of services; the relationship between place and wellbeing; research in health and social care; theories of counselling; housing and the built environment the third part looks at discrete areas of practice such as mental health; substance abuse, protection work; health promotion; disability studies; working with men; and, child welfare and public responsibility. Each chapter of this book begins with an outline of the content and learning outcomes and includes reflective exercises to allow students to reflect on what they have read, review their learning and consolidate their understanding. Time-pressed readers wanting to 'dip into' the book for relevant areas can do so but, read from cover to cover, the book provides a comprehensive introduction to the key areas of contemporary health and social care practice. It will be particularly helpful for students undertaking health and social care undergraduate and foundation degrees.

Realist evaluation in practice : health and social work
This anthology brings together a series of essays on transnational themes and methodological approaches pertaining to the historical study of global health, welfare and humanitarianism. The essays on topics ranging from missions to methods offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness and evolving nature of global charitable work, as well as its contribution as an historical antecedent of contemporary (secular) notions of ‘global citizenship’ and global health. Written by and about northern Europeans and North Americans interested in transnational knowledge exchanges in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, these essays reflect the complex ways in which both historians and their subjects transverse(d) national, gendered, racial and religious boundaries. Through them, the authors open up new questions about the nature of transnationalism (and transnational research) itself.
