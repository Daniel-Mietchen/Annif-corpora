The objective of the thesis was to study how customer satisfaction of corporate clientele in meeting services and facilities could be improved in Maritime Centre Vellamo. The research also aimed to conduct an overall survey of Maritime Centre Vellamos' present situation as a meeting location from corporate clients' point of view. Based on the results, development suggestions were presented to Maritime Centre Vellamo. Opened in 2008, Maritime Centre Vellamo houses the Maritime Museum of Finland, Museum of Kymenlaakso and Information Centre Vellamo. It is located in the heart of maritime Kotka, at the old City Port, in the middle of traditional and genuine harbor environment. In addition to museums, Maritime Centre Vellamo offers modern and functional conference and catering facilities for seminars, corporate events and private occasions. The theoretical framework consists of literature on business travel & tourism as well as the meetings industry. The main emphasis is however on customer satisfaction. The research method is qualitative, and the data was gathered in the form of holding semi-structured interviews with Maritime Centre Vellamo's corporate client organizations. The interview questions were formed in co-operation with Maritime Centre Vellamo. Results showed that Maritime Centre Vellamo's corporate clients are mainly very satisfied in meeting services. However, valuable development suggestions were gathered from the interviewees' answers. Most significant suggestions for development were related to the ideas of new meeting packages, and catering services of restaurant Laakonki.  Emphasis was put also on how the corporate clients could include museum programs into their stay in Vellamo, since the museum tours were seen as an interesting extra program to a meeting day among the corporate client organizations.
