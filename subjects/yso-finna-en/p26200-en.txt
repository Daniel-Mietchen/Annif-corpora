"The approach to anesthesia in children poses specific challenges such as acute emotional fear and distress, fluid imbalances, greater risks for dangerous upper respiratory infections, and most importantly, dosing requirements. The guest editors on this issue are the leaders in this field and will collect the best contributors to address new research advances in perioperative and postoperative scenarios, as well as offering best practices for common pediatric procedures." -- (Elsevier)

Summary.
The mechanistic basis of chronic inflammation remains unclear. The research sheds new light on the immune cells expressing the activation markers HLA-DR and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the cells expressing Siglec receptors as being key players in the immune system responsiveness to antigens and thus in lung tissue damage of chronic inflammation. The results help understand the mechanisms of action of common drugs used in COPD, such as formoterol, tiotropium, or corticosteroids, and point to novel drug targets. The chapters also deal with brain damaging effects, by far unrecognized, of inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a time-proven management of chronic inflammatory airway conditions; asthma being a case in point. Novel methods, likely less producing side effects, of macrolide antibiotics administration by inhalation are discussed, emphasizing not only bacteriostatic but also anti-inflammatory action.

Obstructive sleep apnea from symptoms to follow-up
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent sleep disordered breathing disorder. It has become apparent that in more than half the patients with OSA, the frequency and duration of apneas are influenced by body position. To treat patients with Position Dependent OSA (POSA), positional therapy can be considered for preventing patients from sleeping in the worst sleeping position. Treatment of POSA has advanced dramatically recently with the introduction of a new generation of positional therapy. Positional Therapy in Obstructive Sleep Apnea presents improved OSA diagnostic methods and.
