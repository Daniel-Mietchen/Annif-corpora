polymers
"Because of the recent explosion of interdisciplinary research in renewable polymers, the knowledge base is scattered and it is now timely to have an overview from a respected chemist and successful author. The book focuses on biopolymers as well as low molecular compounds that can be synthesized from renewable polymers. After introducing general aspects of the field, the subsequent chapters then look at the chemistry of biodegradable polymeric types sorted by their chemical compounds, including the synthesis of low molecular compounds. The factors influencing degradation and biodegradation of polymers for food packaging in various environments is detailed at length. The medical applications covered concentrate on controlled drug delivery, temporary prostheses, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. The author then turns his attention to renewable resources for fabricating biofuels and argues for localized biorefineries as biomass feedstocks are more efficiently handled locally"--

Today, young cosmetics researchers who have completed their graduate studies and have entered a cosmetics company are put through several years of training before they become qualified to design cosmetics formulations themselves. They are trained so that they can design formulas not by a process of logic but by heart, like craftsmen, chefs, or carpenters. This kind of training seems a terrible waste of labor and time. To address this issue and allow young scientists to design novel cosmetics formulations, effectively bringing greater diversity of innovation to the industry, this book provides
Plasticity for Structural Engineers is a practical work that provides engineers and students in structural engineering or structural mechanics with the background needed to make the transition from fundamental theory to computer implementation and engineering practice. It sets out initially to examine the stress-strain behaviors of materials under simple test conditions, goes on to show how these behaviors can be generalized under combined stresses, and finally outlines the finite element implementation of the generalized stress-strain relations for the solution of practical steel and concrete structural problems. Plasticity for Structural Engineers not only offers the reader an understanding of the fundamental principles and theory of plasticity in a form that does not require extensive mathematical experience, but also provides the reader with a compact and convenient summary of the modern development of concrete plasticity and limit analysis in structural engineering.

This thesis is a part of the research group in PIMA`s research about the usage of OLLA and PLLA in the bone tissue engineering. The objective of this thesis was to research the usage of OLLA/PLLA as scaffold material. The aim was to produce different composites of OLLA/PLLA and measure the chemical and physical properties of them. The used method was solvent casting and salt leaching technique. In this technique porous structure is made with salt tube which is filled with polymers in liquid phase. After the polymers are settled in a tube and the tube is cooled down salt particles are leached out of the scaffold. By doing this only porous structure will remain. When producing OLLA the method from Valencia was used. In that method OLLA is formed by concentrating lactic acid. Unfortunately the PLLA which was used had really high molecular weight. This caused a problem in solubility. Also the time was an issue, there was not enough time to do all the tests. And last but not least samples were ruined in later phase. Still, it was possible to make porous scaffolds out of these polymers so further research is needed.
