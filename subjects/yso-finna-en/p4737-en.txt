Headlines of daily newspapers announce that 90% of all German employees do not feel satisfied  at work. This statement contradicts with the increasing importance of innovative and motivated  people that are needed by modern companies. Technological modernization and automation lead  to global competition and growing challenges for all companies being part of the international  economic system. These developments hide the request for unique and personalized services that  have to be designed for demanding customers by employees being proactive problem-solvers.  Combining the corporate success with employee's satisfaction is seen as the modern challenge for  HR Managers during the 21st century and defines the focus of this thesis report.  The search for an answer firstly lead to the investigation of various theories on basic human  needs and demonstrated the development of corresponding motivational methods towards a  more intangible approach called intrinsic motivation. Nowadays employees demand different  rewards from work than 20 years ago. The growth of the service industry has been the release for  testing the need for a modernized motivational model at hotels belonging to that sector.  Aiming to examine the sustainable impact of intrinsic motivation, the empirical research tested  the current satisfaction level and rewarding preferences from staff members belonging to  different hierarchical levels of a 5-star luxury hotel. Consequently the openness of modern staff  for new motivational models was spotted and starting points for the method's implementation  could be identified. People stressed their tendency towards intangible motivators but never forgot  to mention financial security. Findings from empirical research also revealed the request for a  motivational model stimulating people's ability to realize their full potential and express their  personality by simultaneously benefiting the corporate success. This desire stresses career  supporting opportunities and support for cross-departmental communication.  Finally, the combination of literature review findings and empirical results formed the fundament  for creating innovative implications for future managers who try to benefit the company as well  as their staff members. The establishment of a model that revives people's passion for  performing a job and intends to direct people's attention towards intrinsic motivators  constituting one step towards a long-term motivation. On the basis of ensuring a fair salary the  new strategy tries to deflect people's focus on monetary reward by stressing personal growth  potential.

Don't shoot the dog! : the new art of teaching and training
Reward and benefit programs have been a topic in the hospitality industry for many, many years. However, in most cases, the topic has been dealt with from perspective hotel guest/- client. This thesis will concern itself with benefit and reward programs from the point of view of employees and employers. It will begin with a general overview and gradually go on to focus on the hospitality sector. The objectives of this research were to give an outlook of the current situation in the hospitality industry in the field of monetary rewards. Additional aims are contrasting the hospitality sector with a different industry and, introducing new ideas from other industries into the hospitality branch. Another long-term goal was to promote the practical application of some of the ideas and recommendations by hotels. The final and most important aim of this report was to demonstrate both the importance of these programs, especially in the hospitality sector and the results for both parties.     The research for this thesis was undertaken by the means of three methods:    Firstly, a literature review was undertaken. It was used to clarify the definitions of reward management and employee benefits. Furthermore, to demonstrate and give a deeper understanding of the different types of monetary rewards systems. It shed light on the different goals of monetary reward management and the pro and contra points of the different methods. Other aspects that were explored the variety of perspectives from which different individuals and companies viewed situations, as well as the impact these programs had on companies and employees.      Secondly, an investigation of the current situation - in mainly five star hotels confronted theory with real life situations - and revealed the impact of these programs on both sides. To this end, several HR directors were interviewed by means of a questionnaire.   Thirdly, a survey questioning HR directors about their reward and benefit programs showed the importance and necessity of these programs. The interviews as well as the questionnaires showed that many hotels have already started to implement monetary reward management into their benefit programs; however there is still much room for improvement and recommendations from other industries.

"Governments around the world can address many of society's biggest challenges such as the current economic crisis by becoming better at innovating. "The public innovator's playbook" report, published by Deloitte Research in the U.S. with the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Institute for the Democratic Governance and Innovation, describes how governments have the opportunity to help improve the economic environment, create jobs, and more efficiently manage costs. According to the book, governments currently innovate. Moreover, some creative approaches in the private sector come from the public sector. However, few governments take an integrated view of the process or treat it as a disciplineâ€”which includes methodic processes, reward systems, and a mission linked to the process and organizational structure." --Publisher's description.

Managing motivation of people in fair trade -organizations
The objective of this thesis was to research the motivation of people involved in promoting Fair Trade in Austria through an Fair Trade Organization (FTO). Once this was achieved, suggestions for an optimal organizational incentive and reward system which keeps up people's enthusiasm, their willingness to engage in and - in the end - their performance could be made. The study was structured on the following questions: What kind of people engage in FTOs, which incentives are used in FTOs, what are the motivators for people working in FTOs and how should incentive systems in FTOs look like?    The introduction presents the current players in Austria's Fair Trade System - ARGE Welt-lÃ¤den, EZA Fairer Handel GmbH and FAIRTRADE Austria and which role they presently take up. The theoretical framework was based on literate review of the most influential and recognized motivation theories, which attempt to explain peoples' behavior and thus built the fundament for designing measures to manage employees' effort. These measures cover incentives, rewards, organizational structures and more, which are described in the second part of the literature review.    The study was conducted in the form of an online questionnaire, which was distributed via the three presented organizations to their personnel and volunteers. The link to the questionnaire was online from the 28th of February until the 15th of March where 108 people responded. The analytical approach was quantitative with a minor qualitative part.

The Global Future of Higher Education and the Academic Profession focuses on the all-important emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) nations by analyzing the academic profession and particularly salaries and contracts. The professoriate is key to the success of any academic system, and this is the first book to carefully analyze academic systems and the academic profession. The academic profession must be adequately paid, and appointments to academic jobs must be based on merit and provide an effective career path for the 'best and brightest' to be attracted to the profession. The BRICs show a variety of approaches to academic careers-and none provide globally competitive salaries. China and Russia, in particular, pay academics poorly. Using purchasing power parity, this book is able to accurately compare the actual purchasing power of the academic profession. The book also analyzes how professors are appointed and promoted. While the BRICs may be emerging global economic powers, their academic systems still face significant challenges.
