The Handbook of Participatory Video advances the field as the first major work to critically examine the use of participatory video around the world as a tool for research, community activism, and social change. Participatory video is a growing area of research and an increasingly popular tool among practitioners, researchers, and NGOs working with communities around the world. The Handbook of Participatory Video advances the field, engaging critically with it as a research methodology and method and interrogating assumptions about its emancipatory nature and potential for social change. In twenty-eight chapters, contributors examine historical, ethical, methodological, and technical aspects of participatory video and discuss power, ownership, and knowledge production. The Handbook is organized into six parts: Locating Participatory Video, Participatory Video as a Critical Research Methodology, Working with Visual Data, Power and Ethics in Participatory Video, Dissemination and Reaching New Audiences, and Communities and Technologies. This benchmark work takes an interdisciplinary and global approach and will be invaluable to researchers, practitioners, and students.

Guitarra de Palo is a 70 minutes independent musical movie on the verge of documentary and fiction whose purpose is filming the music from "inside" understanding the music itself and the culture around. It was made between the spring of 2009 and summer of 2011 by the flamenco guitarist and composer Antón Jiménez and I, Andrea Zapata Girau, who co-produced, directed, filmed and edited it. Flamenco is the main music style in the film but, without loosing its roots, it dialogues with other styles such as Latin-jazz, Russian folklore or contemporary classical music. In the cast you can find some of the main names of those styles, artists such as the dancer Lola Greco, the flamenco singer Diego "El Cigala" or the Latin-jazz trumpet player Jerry González. As we did not have any grants or a production company behind, all the artists participated disinterestedly, just because they liked the concept. We wanted the locations to be the ones the music evocated, in addition the musicians involved lived in different countries, so the movie turned into a long trip searching for those elements. Places such as Andalusia, Berlin, Havana, Cayman Islands, Nicaragua or New York, with their people and pieces of everyday life, also became the protagonists of the film. Guitarra de Palo will be screened on TV, theaters and distributed on DVD. When showed in theatres it  will have a show after the screening that brings the whole world of Guitarra de Palo to the stage.
