Vibration spectrum analysis : a practical approach
This final thesis was a literal investigation about the effects of vibration to helicopter systems. The objective was to examine the vibration test result of the NH-90 multi-mission helicopter done by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health and determine if the vibration measured would possess any threats to the helicopters systems and avionics. The basic information about vibration in helicopter was collected using various literal sources like standards and books. The information about the actual threats caused by vibration to modern avionics was gathered from various university studies and other related articles. This was because the concept of how vibration may cause a threat to modern avionics is still considered rather fresh and the information was not that easy to achieve with the resources at hand. The test results were provided by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health. During the investigation it became clear that the vibration tests done by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health was a rather narrow for this kind of investigation to be inclusive. Therefore, the objective of this work was not totally achieved and another vibration test must be done to achieve total satisfaction. Some ideas for the next possible vibration test are represented at the end of this work.

This thesis was part of a development program coordinated by the Finnish Defense Forces. This program includes several development projects for military communication systems.    The purpose of this thesis was to examine precise oscillators for ensuring the synchronization of communication systems. General oscillator techniques and theory were studied. This thesis deals with the oscillator technologies and the implementation of precise oscillator prototype.    The main design targets of the oscillator unit were high accuracy, compatibility with a tactical router, small size and usability. The oscillator unit can be used with a tactical router or as a stand-alone precise clock source. The prototype of an oscillator unit was planned, developed and tested in this project.    The oscillator unit includes a GPS synchronized precise atomic clock, a microcontroller, control logic and interface circuits. The oscillator unit has also interfaces for oscillator control and testing.    The chip scale atomic clock is a precise timing source. GPS system is the main timing source of the router. The oscillator acts as a secondary timing source of the tactical router. Further development ideas were presented in order to increase the performance of the oscillator unit. Key words: tactical router, oscillator, synchronization, timing.
Yhteenveto (Finnish summary)
This book focuses on applications for offshore platforms and piping; wind-induced vibration of buildings, bridges, and towers; and acoustic and mechanical vibration of heat exchangers, power lines, and process ducting. Numerous examples drive home the reality of the practical problems encountered here. More than 200 figures and 20 tables complement the text by providing such data as damping factors, lift coefficients, and the formulas needed to apply practical methods directly to a wide range of structures, from heat exchangers to hypersonic aircraft. Devoted to the analysis and prediction of flow-induced vibrations, this volume will prove of immense interest to mechanical, civil, nuclear, marine, structural, and electrical engineers; physicists, designers, and naval architects; and people working in the construction and petroleum industries, power plants, power transmission, ship building, nuclear power, energy production, and defense engineering.
