The USSR is often regarded as the world's first propaganda state. Particularly under Stalin, politically charged rhetoric and imagery dominated the press, the schools, and the cultural forums from literature and cinema to the fine arts. Yet party propagandists were repeatedly frustrated in their efforts to promote a coherent sense of 'Soviet' identity during the interwar years. This book investigates this failure to mobilize society along communist lines by probing the secrets of the party's ideological establishment and indoctrinational system. It also analyzes the impact that the 'official line' had at the grassroots by tracking the resonance that this propaganda generated within society at large. An expose of systemic failure within Stalin's ideological establishment, "Propaganda State in Crisis" ultimately rewrites the history of Soviet indoctrination and mass mobilization between 1927 and 1941.

"Retired navy officer Adolfo Scilingo was the first man ever to break the Argentine military's pact of silence, stunning his compatriots and the world by openly confessing his participation in the hideous practice of pushing live political dissidents out of airplanes during Argentina's dirty war. Available for the first time in paperback, with a new introduction by Judge Gabriel Cavallo on the upcoming military trials and a new epilogue by the author, Confessions of an Argentine Dirty Warrior includes the complete text of Scilingo's confession in the form of interviews given to Argentina's best-known investigative journalist, Horacio Verbitsky, along with an afterword by Juan Méndez, putting these events in the context of the dirty war." --Publisher's description.
