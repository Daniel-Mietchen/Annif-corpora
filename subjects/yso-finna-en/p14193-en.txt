"Pain and the Conscious Brain brings together more than 30 international leaders from multiple fields to link the complex concept of pain to the equally complex notion of consciousness. Offering a clear, cutting-edge understanding of the brain mechanisms that generate the conscious experience of pain, this book scientifically addresses the difficult and chronic pains that often have no known physical cause and can defy comprehension in terms of current pain theories. Numerous tables, full-color figures, and up-to-date references highlight expert coverage of today's gradual paradigm shift from peripheral receptors to the intricacy of the brain and the experience of the self. Beginning with a solid introduction to consciousness and pain, this unique volume covers neurobiological aspects of the pain experience during psycho-physiological changes of the conscious state, pain processing in psychiatric and neurological disorders affecting consciousness, specific clinical populations, and the future of pain and consciousness research. Key topics include cortical imaging of pain in humans, pain perception during sleep, pharmacologic approaches to pain and consciousness using functional neuroimaging, hypnosis, mindfulness and meditation, pain and consciousness in infants, recognizing pain in dementia, the role of vision in pain perception, robot pain, and more." --Provided by publisher.

Whilst the body has recently assumed greater sociological significance, there has been less engagement in social work and social care on the bodily experience of health, illness and disease. This innovative volume redresses the balance by exploring chronic illness and social work, through the specific lens of autoimmunity, engaging in wider debates around vulnerability, resistance and the lived experience of ongoing ill-health. Moving beyond existing conceptualisations of vulnerability as an issue of mental distress, ageing, child protection and poverty, Price and Walker demonstrate the role that society has to play in actively engaging the physical body, rather than working around and through it. The book focuses on auto-immune conditions such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. Conditions like these allow for an exploration of the materiality of illness which exacerbates social and economic vulnerability and may precipitate personal and social crises, requiring a variety of interventions and support. The risks and challenges associated with chronic illness include disruptions to a sense of self and identity, altered relationships and the renegotiation of roles and responsibilities in a variety of relationships in addition to an economic impact, with the potential for disruption to employment status and financial insecurity. This text opens up a range of debates around some of the central concerns of the social work profession, including vulnerability, ill-health, and independence. It will be of interest to scholars and students of social work, nursing, disability studies, medicine and the social sciences.

Management of pain
"The essays in this book explore the critical possibilities that have been opened by Veena Das's work. Taking off from her writing on pain as a call for acknowledgment, several essays explore how social sciences render pain, suffering, and the claims of the other as part of an ethics of responsibility. They search for disciplinary resources to contest the implicit division between those whose pain receives attention and those whose pain is seen as out of sync with the times and hence written out of the historical record. Another theme is the co-constitution of the event and the everyday, especially in the context of violence. Das's groundbreaking formulation of the everyday provides a frame for understanding how both violence and healing might grow out of it. Drawing on notions of life and voice and the struggle to write one's own narrative, the contributors provide rich ethnographies of what it is to inhabit a devastated world. Ethics as a form of attentiveness to the other, especially in the context of poverty, deprivation, and the corrosion of everyday life, appears in several of the essays. They take up the classic themes of kinship and obligation but give them entirely new meaning. Finally, anthropology's affinities with the literary are reflected in a final set of essays that show how forms of knowing in art and in anthropology are related through work with painters, performance artists, and writers"--

Ongoing pain is the most costly health problem facing the world. Based on decades of research, Explain Pain (2003) launched what can only be called a revolution – the Explain Pain Revolution. Explaining Pain has become one of the world’s most effective and inexpensive treatments for pain. It is now the cornerstone of modern pain treatment and rehabilitation – with clinical studies showing its benefits across cultures, conditions and communities. In this patient-targeted handbook, we combine unique and original artwork with material that has been refined over the last twenty years. Scientists now agree that pain happens when the credible evidence of DANGER to your body is greater than the credible evidence of SAFETY to your body. Using this knowledge, we have developed the Protectometer – an easy to use tool that will help you apply this principle to understand and deal with your pain.

"The essays in this book examine how important themes in Veena Das's work have been critically assimilated in the work of a younger generation. Looking at the relation between the event and the everyday, the essays ask how we might trace the picture of thinking in anthropology through ethnography and through artistic, literary and philosophical practice"--

From the publisher: This book is a collection of new and controversial views on pain, its accessibility to understanding and its influence on knowledge. Despite contrary assumptions, the volume argues for the possibility to externalise and communicate pain through language, narrative and social contextualisation. Expressions and responses to pain are historicized and studied within several humanitarian disciplines.
