The conquest of Everest
NOLS Wilderness mountaineering
Each player leads a team of two mountaineers who are competing with other teams, trying to reach the peak and survive until the end of the 18-day expedition. Players move mountaineers on the board by playing cards. The higher a climber reaches, the more victory points are gained. However K2 is a very dangerous place and mountaineers must be very careful not to exhaust themselves, carefully planning their route and being aware of changes in the weather.
