Mismatch negativity (MMN) as a tool for investigating auditory discrimination in infants and school-age children
Soldiers are at risk of incurable noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in military activities. Therefore the prevention of hearing loss is important. The large variation in individual susceptibility to NIHL is well known but the reason for this is not completely understood.The data of this current comprehensive register-based follow-up study consist of the health records, hearing measuring results and occupational history of 1 941 soldiers. The occurrence and degree of hearing losses among soldiers who served between 1965 and 2007 was investigated by comparing groups formed according to year-class and service branch. An association between cardiovascular risk factors and NIHL was also assessed. Furthermore the efficacy of the hearing conservation measures carried out by the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) and the Finnish Border Guard (FBG) was evaluated.Noise turned out to be the major risk factor of hearing impairment among the investigated soldiers. The occurrence of NIHL (hearing threshold at 3,4 or 6 kHz >40 dB) was at least around 10 percentages lower among soldiers who started their career in 1990s than in the older year-classes 15 years after the beginning of military career. Concurrently, the decline of the average degree of hearing loss at high tones improved around 20 dB. The occurrence of NIHL was the lowest among pilots, musicians and naval soldiers, and the highest among soldiers in engineering and air defense corps. No clear difference was found between cardiovascular risk factors and NIHL with the exception of hyperglycemia. A clear temporal connection was found between the decline of the occurrence of NIHL among the soldiers and the hearing conservation measures carried out in the late 80s. A review of the four-stage hearing classification used in Finnish occupational health service since the 1970s, as well as the guidelines that rely on them, is needed.

The First Comprehensive Guide to Educational Interpreting As many as 22,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students are currently enrolled in local school programs where their access to the language of learning is dependent upon an interpreter. This book brings together comprehensive information about the practice of interpreting in educational settings. As the author points out, the field of educational interpreting has developed quickly in recent years, creating the need for this practical guide to serve as a resource for interpreters, general education teachers, special education teachers, special education directors, parents, speech-language pathologists, school administrators, and others concerned with the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The book takes a developmental approach to curriculum and instruction regarding students who use interpreters, moving from preschool on through the graduate school. The topics covered relate to the specific needs of learners at each age and apply to interpreters who use sign language, cued speech, and oral interpreting. Each section is presented in a question-answer format, with an emphasis on the challenges posed by interpreting in educational setting and the practices best suited to meeting those challenges. For each of the educational settings, engaging case studies focus on real-life situations and are followed by suggested best-practice solutions as well as questions for further thought.

Best practices in educational interpreting
The way in which education is provided for deaf children in both special settings and mainstream schools is changing, as are the demands made on teachers. Written by specialists, this book responds by providing a comprehensive, accessible and up-to-date account of recent research and current issues in educational policy, psychology, linguistics and audiology, as they relate to deaf education. It also provides detailed information about further reading. The book will appeal to student teachers and teachers of the deaf; teachers in mainstream schools; academics working in the area of deafness and disability; audiologists and cochlear implant teams; and parents of deaf children and members of the deaf community.
