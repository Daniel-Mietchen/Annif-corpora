Methods of argumentation
We are bombarded with more information each day than our brains can process, especially in election season. It's raining bad data, half-truths, and even outright lies. Daniel J. Levitin shows how to recognize misleading announcements, statistics, graphs, and written reports revealing the ways lying weasels can use them. This book outlines recommendations for critical thinking practices that meet the challenges of the digital age's misinformation, demonstrating the role of science in information literacy while explaining the importance of skeptical reasoning in making decisions based on online information.

What are the limitations of computer models and why do we still not have working models of people that are recognizably human?Â This is the principle puzzle explored in this book where ideas behind systems that behave intelligently are described and different philosophical issues are touched upon.Â The key to human behaviour is taken to be intelligence and the ability to reason about the world To approach this scientifically, it is necessary to understand what a scientific approach could mean in the context of both natural and artificial systems.Â A theory of intelligence is proposed that can be tested and developed in the light of experimental results.Â The author illustrates that intelligence is much more than just behaviour confined to a unique person or a single computer program within a fixed time frame.Â Some answers are unravelled and some puzzles emerge from these investigations and experiments.Â Natural and Artificial Reasoning describes a few steps on an exciting journey that began many centuries ago with the word âwhy?â

Cognitive psychology : a student's handbook
"Argumentation, which can be abstractly defined as the interaction of different arguments for and against some conclusion, is an important skill to learn for everyday life, law, science, politics, and business. The best way to learn it is to try it out on real instances of arguments found in everyday conversational exchanges and legal argumentation. The introductory chapter of this book gives a clear general idea of what the methods of argumentation are and how they work as tools that can be used to analyze arguments. Each subsequent chapter then applies these methods to a leading problem of argumentation. Today the field of computing has embraced argumentation as a paradigm for research in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. Another purpose of this book is to present and refine tools and techniques from computing as components of the methods that can be handily used by scholars in other fields"--
