The world of learning
Within the past 15 years, the field of archival studies around the world has experienced unprecedented growth, both within the academy and the profession, and archival studies graduate education programs today have among the highest enrolments in any information field. During the same period, there has also been unparalleled expansion and innovation in the diversity of methods and theories being applied in archival scholarship. Global in scope, Research in the Archival Multiverse compiles critical and reflective essays across a wide range of emerging research areas and interests in archival studies with the aim of providing current and future archival academics with a text addressing possible methods and theoretical frameworks that have been and might be used in archival scholarship. More than a collation of research methods for handy reference, this volume advocates for reflexive research practice as a means by which to lay bare the fuzziness and messiness of research. Whereas research in the form of published research papers and juried conference presentations provide a view of the study framed in terms of research questions and findings, reflexive research practice reveals the context of the study and chains of situations, choices, and decisions that influence the trajectories of the studies themselves. Such elucidations from the position of the researcher are instructive for others, who may be inspired to apply or adapt the method for their own research.

Selecting & appraising archives & manuscripts
"This book offers a practical and theoretical examination of issue mapping with digital methodologies. The issue at stake concerns the European population where in the near future the old will outnumber the young, threatening the stability of both pension and healthcare systems, and changing the migration patterns of those who need and who provide care. Drawing on the latest theoretical approaches to issue mapping, the authors put them into practice through online mapping techniques to demonstrate ways of exploring the complex issue of demographics and the debates surrounding data available online. The authors use the websites of non-governmental organizations to locate the ageing issue agenda, and varying levels of attention given to the shared as well as isolated concerns. Online job portals provide data about not only employment opportunities but also the movement of care workers, pointing up potential 'victim states' in the ageing world. Search engine queries are designed to identify cultural philosophies about ageing, not to mention European anti-ageing cuisine" --

The changes of the past few decades have occasioned a review of what it is that archives are doing as a discipline. These changes have come from several quarters: interdisciplinary engagement with the notion of the archive; technological developments, not least the advent of Web 2.0; and, the information explosion and the growth of several allied disciplines, including records and information management. This timely reader asks where the discipline has come from and where it must now go to remain professionally relevant in the 21st century, by negotiating the complex boundaries and borders of the 'state of the archive', in terms of geographical borders and nationalities and disciplinary borders. The book is divided into four primary sections covering the following key themes: defining archives; shaping a discipline; Archives 2.0: archives in society; and, archives in the information age: is there still a role for the archive professional? This book offers a clearly structured approach to developments in archives and record keeping.
