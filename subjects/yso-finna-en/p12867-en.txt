This groundbreaking book both explains and expands the growing debate on ecological (environmental) social work at the global level. In order to achieve this, the book strengthens the environmental paradigm in social work and social policy by undertaking further research on theoretical and conceptual clarification as well as distinct reflections on its practical directions. Divided into five parts: concepts; the impact of environmental crises; sustainable communities and lifestyles; food politics; and the profession in transition, this work's main objective is to place ecological social work as a part of the more comprehensive and interdisciplinary eco-social transition of societies towards sustainability, balancing economic and social development with the limited resources of the natural environment. By focussing on these five core concepts, it shows how social work and social policy contribute to this transition through having a research-based approach and orientation on solutions rather than problem analysis. The book will be of interest to scholars from a broad range of disciplines, including those in social work and social policy, sustainability, economics, agriculture and environmental studies.

Handbook of international social work : human rights, development, and the global profession
This is a collectively written, inter-disciplinary, thematic cross-national study which combines conceptual, theoretical, empirical and policy material in an ambitious and innovative way to explore a key concept in contemporary European political, policy and academic debates. The first part of the book clarifies the various ways that the concept of citizenship has developed historically and is understood today in a range of Western European welfare states. It elaborates on the contemporary framing of debates and struggles around citizenship. This provides a framework for three policy studies, looking at: migration and multiculturalism; the care of young children; and home-based childcare and transnational dynamics. The book is unusual in weaving together the topics of migration and childcare and in studying these issues together within a gendered citizenship framework. It also demonstrates the value of a multi-level conceptualisation of citizenship, stretching from the domestic sphere through the national and European levels to the global. The book is aimed at students of social policy, sociology, European studies, women's studies and politics and at researchers/scholars/policy analysts in the areas of: citizenship; gender; welfare states; and, migration.

Comparative social policy: : concepts, theories and methods
This timely, pathbreaking report examines the challenges that face all countries, both rich and poor, in the last years of the century. There is a growing human crisis, as families and communities encounter the pressures of global competition, migration, and reductions in public spending, as well as an environmental crisis, with the combined explosion of population and consumption threatening the stability of our oceans and climate. The Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life, headed by Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, former Prime Minister of Portugal, outlines bold goals to confront these crises. Its controversial report places women at the center of development, and caring at the center of public policy, arguing that there must be a new focus on sustainable quality of life in order to slow population growth and reduce our impact on the environment. Both readable and lively, this authoritative work covers a broad spectrum of social problems from hunger, illiteracy, and domestic violence to unemployment and family planning. It goes on to offer strategic views on addressing these complex issues, such as designing policies around quality of life concerns, new forms of governance based on democracy, and a new emphasis on the worldwide threat of crime, disease, pollution, and environmental hazards rather than warfare.
