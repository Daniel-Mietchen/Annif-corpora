"Self-criticism is a personality trait that has been implicated in a wide range of psychopathologies and developmental arrests. Defined as the tendency to set unrealistically high standards for one's self and to adopt a punitive stance towards the self once these standards are not met, self-criticism is both active and cyclical. Self-critics actively create the social-interpersonal conditions that generate their distress, and their distress itself exacerbates self-criticism. Erosion offers a comprehensive treatment of self-criticism based in philosophy, developmental science, personality and clinical psychology, social theories, and cognitive-affective neuroscience. Professor Golan Shahar expertly summarizes the most recent research on the topic and synthesizes theory, empirical research, and clinical practice guidelines for assessment, prevention, and treatment. The book rests upon three elements that, as Shahar argues, are central to the maintenance of self-critical vulnerability: the importance of a concept of an authentic self or the need to "feel real"; the importance of intentionality and goal-directedness; and the power of interpersonal relationships and cultural context. Shahar argues that exploring these elements requires an integrated clinical approach that incorporates multidimensional assessment and interventions which reconcile science, practice, and policy. The result is a broad and scholarly volume that is useful to practitioners, researchers, and theorists interested in self-criticism"--

"Adolescence is a period of rapid growth, maturing individuality, vulnerabilities and fortitude. Fortunately, most youths go through this period of life in a healthy way, but some do not. Adolescent Mental Health: Prevention and Intervention is a concise and accessible overview of our current knowledge on effective treatment and prevention programs for youths who have developed, or are at risk of developing, mental health problems. Ogden and Hagen's introduction to "what works" in the promotion of adolescent mental health addresses some of the most common mental health problems among young people, and how these problems might be prevented or ameliorated through professional and systematic efforts. The volume illustrates contemporary and empirically supported interventions and prevention efforts through a series of case studies, and covers some of the most prevalent mental health conditions affecting today's youth; externalizing, internalizing and drug use problems. Within an ecological and transactional framework, the book discusses how psychopathologies may develop and the risks and protective factors associated with these. The problem-oriented perspective on risk and mental health problems is combined with a focus on social competence and other protective factors. Adolescent Mental Health: Prevention and Intervention will be essential reading for students and practitioners in the fields of child welfare and mental health services, and any professionals working with adolescents at risk of developing mental health problems"--

"This is the most up-to-date text about theory and research on the etiology and treatment of the most important psychological disorders. It is intended for first-year graduate students in clinical psychology, counseling psychology, and related fields. Readers will appreciate that the length, organization, content, and level and style of writing remain appropriate for the audience throughout. Thoroughly revised, this third edition continues to disseminate research- and empirically-supported information on psychopathology, while also challenging students to think critically, not just memorize information. New additions to the text include sections on dissociative disorders, dimensional approaches, the biological bases of psychopathology, developmental psychology, and a chapter on learning theories that lays out the principles of learning".
"This book provides a comprehensive review of new developments in the study of language processing and related neural networks in schizophrenia by addressing the complex link between psychopathology, language and evolution at different levels of analysis. Psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenia are mainly characterized by thought and language disorders, which are strictly intertwined. In particular, language is the distinctive dimension of human beings and is ontologically related to brain development. Although normal at the levels of segmental phonology and morphological organization, the speech of patients suffering from schizophrenia is often characterized by flattened intonation and word-finding difficulties. Furthermore, research suggests that the superior temporal gyrus and specific prefrontal areas which support language in humans are altered in people with schizophrenia. Brambilla and Marini bring together international contributors to explore the link between brain evolution and the psychopathological features of schizophrenia, with a focus on language and its neural underpinnings. Divided into three sections the book covers: brain evolution and language phylogenesis brain abnormalities in schizophrenia psychopathology and schizophrenia. This theoretical approach will appeal to professionals including clinical psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, neuropsychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurolinguists, and researchers considering the links between brain evolution, language and psychopathology in schizophrenia"--
"Addictions to drugs or alcohol are usually apparent, but what about behavioral addictions? A person addicted to shoplifting or gambling, for example, or picking at their skin, may suffer in the shadows while their behavior consumes their time and energy--and disrupts their life. Legal, medical, and financial troubles are common for such a person and their loved ones, as are social and family conflicts. Behavioral addictions are serious illnesses and usually do not go away on their own--telling the loved one to simply stop doing the behavior will not work. This book is for anyone who has a behavioral addiction, and for their families and friends. It describes what a behavioral addiction is, what causes it, and how it can be diagnosed and treated. It takes an in-depth look at seven specific addictions: to gambling, stealing, sex, internet use, shopping and buying, hair pulling and skin picking, and food. Behavioral addictions have a physical basis in the brain and are addictive because, like alcohol and narcotics, they are rewarding. The addicted person spends enormous amounts of time preparing for or engaging in the habit, and in the process neglects other areas of life. He or she may also be convicted of a crime, put their sexual partner at risk of infection, lose their job due to negligence and their home due to debt. These repetitive habits persist despite negative consequences so that, ultimately, the person loses all conscious control over the behavior. The guidance provided here helps readers deal with the complicated issues surrounding these addictions, including how family members can help the addicted person while helping themselves. Dr. Grant has published many books and has appeared on CNN, BBC, GMA, The Early Show, and elsewhere"--
Abnormal psychology : the problem of maladaptive behavior
"From a pioneering researcher, this book synthesizes the best current knowledge on resilience in children and adolescents. Ann S. Masten explores what allows certain individuals to thrive and adapt despite adverse circumstances, such as poverty, chronic family problems, or exposure to trauma. Coverage encompasses the neurobiology of resilience as well as the role of major contexts of development: families, schools, and culture. Identifying key protective factors in early childhood and beyond, Masten provides a cogent framework for designing programs to promote resilience. Complex concepts are carefully defined and illustrated with real-world examples"--

"Valeria Ugazio presents a new model of personality and psychopathology by examining four common psychological approaches (phobic, obsessive-compulsive, eating disorders, and depression) in the context of the family. She offers an intersubjective approach to personality, based on a constructionist conception of meanings that focus on the concept of "semantic polarities" (fear/courage, good/evil, etc). Each client who presents with one of the disorders discussed, the author argues, has grown up in contexts, in most cases families, where certain specific values and meanings predominate. In each family where a member has a different kind of disorder, conversation will revolve around a different set of values. A central tenant of the model is that meaning and its organizations are open systems, and thus susceptible to modification. Based on this theory, the author shows therapists how use semantics with their clients to help overcome symptoms"--

"At some point in our lives, we all engage in behaviors that are risky, irrational, or unwise. We might find it exciting and temporarily rewarding to gamble on the lottery or impulsively buy an expensive gadget. But just as substances like alcohol and narcotics have the potential to become addictive, so do certain behaviors. A person addicted to gambling, shopping, the internet, food, or picking at their skin may suffer shame in the shadows while their behavior consumes time and energy and disrupts their life. Some people with behavioral addictions lose their family, job, savings, and home. With a physical basis in the brain, behavioral addictions are serious illnesses--but simply willing yourself to stop is usually not enough. Why Can't I Stop? is for anyone who has a behavioral addiction, as well as their supportive families and friends. Examining seven of the most common and serious addictions--gambling, sex, stealing, internet use, shopping and buying, hair pulling and skin picking, and food--the authors bring together cutting-edge research to describe behavioral addiction, its causes, and how it can be diagnosed and treated. Featuring patient stories of behavioral addiction and recovery, as well as information about treatment centers, this compassionate guide will help readers better understand the complicated issues surrounding these addictions and teach family members how to help the addicted person while helping themselves"--
