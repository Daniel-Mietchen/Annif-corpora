Molecular mechanisms of sleep and mood
Thomas O. Beebee's volume with new studies by leading scholars on the interrelation between German and World Literature is a most welcome contribution to contemporary discussions on the trans-national dimension of cultures. The essays show how 'national literatures are elliptical refractions of world literature' and that German literature has been imbricated in other cultural traditions.

" Sleep is an important part of our everyday life, but still its purpose remains a mystery for researchers. While scientific sleep research concentrates on the different neurobiological charasteristics of sleep, dreams and their interpretation have earlier had an important role in decision making, and still many people seek wisdom from their dreams. The brain is not idle during sleep - on the contrary, during some sleep stages, brain activity is at the same level as during waking - we are simply not aware of it. The key questions are " Can we survive without sleep? ", " Can time spent in sleep be shortened so that we can be more efficient? ", " Is sleep important for creativity? ", and " Does sleep loss cause health problems? " These questions, and many others, were addressed by highly qualified scientists and artists in the Gyllenberg symposium " The Many Aspects of Sleep". The symposium united some of the most eminent sleep researchers in the world today in a discussion of the many faces of sleep. Using their own research as a basis, the lecturers introduced the current frontline of sleep research and discussed the future of sleep research. This volume of Acta Gyllenbergiana contains their presentations. " -- (takakansi)

Uniforms are not unique to Japan, but their popularity there suggests important linkages: material culture, politico-economic projects, bodily management, and the construction of subjectivity are all connected to the wearing of uniforms. This book examines what the donning of uniforms says about cultural psychology and the expression of economic nationalism in Japan. Conformity in dress is especially apparent amongst students, who are required to wear uniforms by most schools. Drawing on concrete examples, the author focuses particularly on student uniforms, which are key socializing objects in Japan's politico-economic order, but also examines 'office ladies' (secretaries), 'salary men' (white collar workers), service personnel, and housewives, who wear a type of uniformed dress. Arguing that uniforms can be viewed as material markers of a life cycle managed by powerful politico-economic institutions, he also shows that resistance to official state projects is expressed by 'anti-uniforming' modes of self.
