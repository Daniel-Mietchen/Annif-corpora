Distinctive in this volume are separate chapters on the diversity of Christianity across the globe. Features include numerous photographs of art and artifacts, maps, timelines, tables, textboxes, pedagogy, and a glossary."--Publisher description.

Listening to Shin Buddhism : starting points of modern dialogue
In The Essence of Shinto, revered Shinto master Motohisa Yamakage explains the core values of Shinto and explores both basic tenets and its more esoteric points in terms readily accessible to the modern Western reader. He shows how the long history of Shintoism is deeply woven into the fabric of Japanese spirituality and mythology--indeed, it is regarded as Japan's very spiritual roots--and discusses its role in modern Japan and the world. He also carefully analyzes the relationship of the spirit and the soul, which will provide informed and invaluable insight into how spirituality affects our daily existence. Through the author's emphasis on the universality of Shinto and its prevalence in the natural world, the book will appeal to all readers with an appreciation of humanity's place in nature and the individual's role in the larger society

Religions of the world : an introduction to culture and meaning
Richard Bowring describes in outline the development of Japanese religious thought and practice from the introduction of writing to the point at which medieval attitudes gave way to a distinctive pre-modern culture, a change that brought an end to the dominance of religious institutions. A wide range of approaches using the resources of art, history, social and intellectual history, as well as doctrine is brought to bear on the subject. The result is as full a picture as possible of the richness of the Japanese tradition as it succeeded in holding together on the one hand Buddhism, with its sophisticated intellectual structures, and on the other hand the disparate local cults that eventually achieved a kind of unity under the rubric of Shinto. An understanding of this process of constant and at times difficult interaction is essential to a deeper appreciation of Japan's history and its cultural achievements.

The invention of religion : rethinking belief in politics and history
A popular dictionary of shinto
"The Kojiki, previously translated as "A Record of Ancient Matters," is considered to be the first literary work in the history of Japan. It is a compilation of myths, history, songs, legends, genealogies, and other disparate works from which written history and literature were later created. The Kojiki tells of the origins of the four home islands of Japan central to the inspiration behind Shinto practices. The work moves in loosely historical progression starting with the creation of Japan in the age of the gods and the descent to earth of the ancestor of the imperial family through the reign of the legendary first sovereign, Emperor Jinmu, and successive rulers up to the reign of the 33rd sovereign, Empress Suiko (who reigned from 592-618). The creation myth describes the origin of Japan through a musuhi or spontaneous power through which the gods came into existence. After seven generations of gods are created by this force the last generation, male and female gods, called Ianagi and Izanami, create the islands of Japan. The two then give birth to the gods of various natural phenomena, including gods of the sea and rivers, of the mountains and plains, of the wind and, finally, of fire, who causes the death of the goddess Izanami. The male deity Izanagi then gives birth himself to the central figure in the Kojiki mythology, the Sun Goddess Amaterasu. Her descendant, the god Ninigi, comes down from heaven to earth and becomes the ancestor of the Yamato emperors"--
