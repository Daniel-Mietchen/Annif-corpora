Deafness and mental health
Persons with deafblindness experience difficulties in daily life and they experience service to sometimes barrier. The overall aim of this thesis is therefore to discover, evaluate and explain: 1. mechanisms that might have impact on participation restrictions for people who have visual and hearing impairment i.e. deafblindness and 2. mechanisms that might barrier service to these people. Service is used as an umbrella term for health care, education and certain service for persons with disabilities. Materials from multiple sources have been used: literature (Study I No 96 papers). Interviews (Study I and V) with 32 and 3 adults with deafblindness respectively. Questionnaires (Study II and III): answered by 33 and 34 adults and youth with deafblindness. Patient records (Study IV and V): records from 9 and 3 adult females with USH I respectively. Materials mostly retrospectively cover the period from 2005 and about 40–50 years. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used.International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) were consequently used as a framework to describe as well as a tool to analyze mechanisms. Further, the Ecological approach, Disability as a laminated system and Life course approach were used in order to evaluate and explain mechanisms. The conclusions that can be drawn from an ecological, laminated and life course approach are: Participation restrictions for people with deafblindness are far-reaching and are embedded in a complex process of interaction between the person with deafblindness and the environment. Services entail systematical barriers. In order to improve service it is extremely important to understand the role of participation restrictions in deafblindness. Primary activity limitation is to not see and hear enough for comprehension. Hence, not taking part in the visible and audible world is primary participation restriction. Performing activities without basic information includes risk.One important aspect of deafblindness is exposure. Persons with deafblindness require rehabilitation in a life perspective. In order to increase people's participation and protection requirement of individually adapted support and assistive devices is necessary. ICF and the UN convention support service alterations.

The story of my life
Most stories about disabled people are written for the sake of being inspirational. These stories tend to focus on some achievement, such as sports or academics, but rarely do they give a true and complete view of the challenges individuals must deal with on a daily basis. For example: How does a deaf-blind person interact with hearing-sighted people at a family reunion? How does she shop for groceries? What goes through his mind when he enters a classroom full of non-handicapped peers? These arent questions you are likely to find answers to while reading that incredible tale of success. They are, however, issues that a deaf-blind person wishes others understood. Deaf-Blind Reality: Living the Life explores what life is really like for persons with a combination of vision and hearing loss, and in a few cases, other disabilities as well. Editor Scott M. Stoffel presents extensive interviews with 12 deaf-blind individuals, including himself, who live around the world, from Missouri to New Zealand, Louisiana to South Africa, and Ohio to England. These contributors each describe their families reactions and the support they received; their experiences in school and entering adulthood; and how they coped with degeneration, ineffective treatments, and rehabilitation. Each discusses their personal education related to careers, relationships, and communication, including those with cochlear implants. Deaf-Blind Reality offers genuine understanding of the unspectacular but altogether daunting challenges of daily life for deaf-blind people.

Life and education of Laura Dewey Bridgeman : the deaf, dumb and blind girl
Helen Keller's triumph over her blindness and deafness has become one of the most inspiring and well-known stories of our time. Through movies and plays, most notably The Miracle Worker, which portrayed her relationship with her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Keller's life has become an emblem of hope for people everywhere. Here, in a book first published when she was a young woman, is Helen Keller's own story - complex, poignant, and filled with love. With unforgettable immediacy, Helen's own words offer an unique look directly into the heart of an exceptional woman and reveal her struggles and joys, including that memorable moment when she finally understands that Anne's fingerspelled letters w-a-t-e-r mean the cold fluid rushing over her hand. HK was always a compassionate and witty advocate for the handicapped, and her sincere and eloquent memoir is deeply moving for the sighted and the blind, the deaf and the hearing, the young and the old...and truly marvelous reading for all. This Signed Classic edition includes a fascimile of the braille alphabet, a sign-language alphabet a full selection of Helen Keller's letters, and a new introduction by Jim Knipfel.
Legacy of the Past : Thouse who are gone but have not left
A questionnaire survey of education provision for hearing impaired children has identified the existence of 54 pupils who are diagnosed as having Usher Syndrome. Pupils with Usher Syndrome have congenital hearing loss and an additional degenerative eye condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which is characterized by progressive night blindness and tunnel vision. While most of the identified pupils are in their mid to late teens, three pupils have been identified at the age of 7 years or below. The survey reveals a large proportion of teachers who are seeking information, guidance and support in their work with these children. It highlights the need for earlier identification, and for the development of expertise in educational management of pupils with Usher Syndrome.

This book is a translated version of her PhD, rewritten to make it accessible for worldwide publication. It documents the 16-years of practical research which underlies these new methods. Haptices and Haptemes is a part of the Social-Haptic Communication philosophy which explores how the humanistic qualities of touch can be applied to different client groups. This includes people who need to develop touch-based communication methods in healthcare and educational settings. It recognises the importance of body language and environmental information in a visual context, allowing greater interactive process between clients and their families in an expanding community.
Impact on participation and service for persons with deafblindness
The present book is a collection of papers based on presentations made at the International Workshop on Bilingualism and Literacy Concerning Deafness and Deaf-blindness, which took place at Skådalen Resource Centre for Special Education of the Hearing Impaired and the Deaf-blind, Oslo, on November 10-13, 1994. The workshop was organized as part of the preparatory phase of the research project The development of Communication and Linguistic Competence in Deaf and Deaf-blind Children. The contributors to the book have their backgrounds in education, psychology, linguistics, and sociology. Some are primarily researchers, others are primarily practitioners in the fields of deaf education and deaf-blind education. The book addresses itself primarily to everybody who takes an interest in the communicative and educational issues concerning deafness and/or deaf-blindness. Some of the papers take a more general perspective on these issues.

A world without words : the social construction of children born deaf and blind
Tactile sign language significantly differs from visual mode of sign language. Based on conversation analysis of deaf-blind dyads, this book describes how turn-taking and interrogative sentences are marked in tactile sign language. Deaf-blind signers are in continuous contact by holding one another's hands in monologue or dialogue position. In tactile conversation, non-manual characteristics, the essential markers in visual sign languages, are effectively replaced by various hand movements.

This investigation was commissioned and funded by SENSE and the Council for the Advancement of Communication with all Deaf People (CACDP). The investigation was designed to explore the communication needs brought about by the addition of visual impairment to an existing hearing loss, where sign language was the chief form of communication; to explore some of the situations imposed by the visual impairment; and to offer possible insights and suggestions to professionals and other interested persons. The most profitable interviews were those conducted in the subject's own home, where natural incidental communication could be observed in addition to the more constrained interview situation. But other helpful interviews took place in centres for the deaf, homes for residential care, colleges; amd other communities. No time limit was imposed on interviews which varied in length and form. The same factual questions concerning age, age and cause of onset of visual impairment and acquisition of sign language were put to all subjects. Place of schooling and method of schooling were also discussed. Less formal questions concerning social activities, relationships, friendships, travelling, shopping etc. were introduced leading to unstructured, but very enlightening, general discussions. The interviews closed, where possible, with the subjects own views about the help needed by, and best approaches from professionals. They were usually reluctant to carry this far.

Games for people with sensory impairments : strategies for including individuals of all ages
The needs of the deaf and deaf-blind people who use sign language and pressure from their own organizations have been the stimulus for getting interpreting services going on society's cost. The interpreting services for deaf and deaf-blind people is based on the Services and Assistance for the Disabled Act, 1988. In the beginning , interpreting services meant interpreting in sign language for the deaf and deaf-blind people; for the deaf-blind people also other means of interpreting were allowed. Nowadays the interpreting services have been enlarged to aid also deafened people who don't know sign language, but who can use for instance written communications in the interpreting situation. The persons with speech difficulties can use interpreting services according to their individual needs.
