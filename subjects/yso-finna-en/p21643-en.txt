A rapidly changing and expanding livestock and poultry production sector is causing a range of environmental problems on local, regional and global scales. Animal Manure Recycling: Treatment and Management presents an accessible overview of environmentally friendly technologies for managing animal manure more efficiently and in a sustainable manner. This book describes the physical and chemical characteristics of animal manure and microbial processes,featuring detailed examples and case studies showing how this knowledge can be used in practice.
