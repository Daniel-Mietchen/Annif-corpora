This thesis was commissioned by Wärtsilä Technical Service. The aim was to survey and report processes concerning engine service tools and to make conclusions about mistakes in tool deliveries and tool usability to be able to avoid same mistakes in future. Mostly the survey concerned tool configuration, identification, design and delivery processes. The starting point of the survey was that many problems occur in the engine service tool deliveries and usability. These errors created work for the Technical Service a lot during the last few years. Because of lack of resources, no one had examined the problems properly. Most of the problems were related to the tool identification process. Needs for development were also found in the design process, configuration process and internal information management. During the survey, information was collected from colleagues, intranet, busines management software, internet and from literary sources. Statistical analysis about error deliverys was made and analyzed. During the survey, it was found difficult to collect information inside a large organisation. Conclusions about the present situation were made and needs for development found. These development ideas were represented for the interested parties.

CMDB Systems: Making Change Work in the Age of Cloud and Agile shows you how an integrated database across all areas of an organization’s information system can help make organizations more efficient reduce challenges during change management and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO). In addition, this valuable reference provides guidelines that will enable you to avoid the pitfalls that cause CMDB projects to fail and actually shorten the time required to achieve an implementation of a CMDB.
