Exploiting images and image collections in the new media : gold mine or legal minefield?
Abstract: The goal of the thesis was to design and develop a new user interface for an image archive. The archive is accessed on the intranet server through the user's web browser. To limit the scope of the thesis, no changes to the database were planned. The user interface was set to be designed from a user centred point of view. For the design, the users were interviewed. The interview was based on a set group of questions, but the line of questions was not strictly followed during the interview. From the interview it was found out that the image archive has two kinds of users, architects and users working in tourism and travel. Both types of have similar requirements for the archive. The users search the archive for images of a certain building or certain types of images. The users are also required to upload images to the archive. Individual pages of the user interface were designed based on the interviews. On the search page the users can define search conditions and search for images based on the conditions. The search page leads to the results page, which displays search results as thumbnails. The user can inspect images by placing the mouse cursor on top of the thumbnail, which causes metadata for the image to be displayed on a box on the right. From the results page the user can enter a browse view by clicking on a thumbnail. On the browse page the user can see the single image in a larger size and navigate to the previous and next images. In the browse page the user can also edit saved metadata and export images from the archive. Adding images to the archive was were decided to be made easier by adding an batch edit system to the archive, where the user can write metadata information to an image by a single mouse click. The images are added to the archive directly from the user's computer. After development and deployment, the archive user interface has been observed to be useful and functional. Significant improvements include quickly browsing through multiple images and saving images to the user's computer. Feedback from the new archive user interface from the users has been mostly positive.
