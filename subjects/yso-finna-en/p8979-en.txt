imitation (artistic creation)
Anorexia and mimetic desire
This insightful volume explores the use of imitation and the modern cult of originality through a consideration of the disparate fates of two Venetian painters - the canonized master Titian (c. 1488-1576) and his artistic heir, the little known Padovanino (1588-1649). "Titian Remade" compares three of Padovanino's paintings - "Sleeping Venus" (1610), "Triumph" (1620), and "Self-Portrait" (ca. 1630) - with corresponding works by Titian, and argues that repetition is not simply the last resort of the uninspired, but can be a positive act of artistic self-definition.

"In this study of prehistoric innovation, the author argues that a range of technologies and practices need to be considered in order to place innovation into the pre-existing social and technological systems in which it functioned and to assess the means by which it was accepted and valued. In particular the study focuses on how archaeological interpretations of stone objects and stone-working can help understand the adoption and continued presence of metal and metallurgy in prehistoric Europe. The author compares traditionally identified stone skeuomorphs--that is, meaningful imitations--of metal with their putative prototypes. Three separate corpora of these stone skeuomorphs have been identified: polished stone shafthole axes from the Netherlands and surrounding areas, identified as copies of perforated, copper axes; flint daggers from Jutland, identified as copies of bronze, metal-hilted daggers; and jet spacer-plate ornaments from the British Isles, Ireland and Brittany, identified as copies of hammered gold lunulae."--

I am not a copycat! : featuring Hugo and Bella
This book "Picturing art history" traces the development of the history and use of art reproductions in the eighteenth century. Showing how reproductions ended up in art books and how in the eighteenth century learned men as Bottari, Winckelmann and d'Agincourt brought art history into the picture by collecting in art cabinets reproductions of drawings and prints. Which later became an essential dimension in the experience of art objects and the writing of art history.

A disturbed student shoots up his classroom -- and suddenly a wave of mass murder is sweeping through our nation's schools. A young child is taken from her home -- and for months afterward child abductions are frantically reported on an almost daily basis. A surfer is attacked by a shark -- and the public spends an entire summer fearing an onslaught of the deadly underwater predators. Why do the terrible events we see in the media always seem to lead to more of the same? Noted author and cultural behaviorist Loren Coleman explores how the media's over-saturated coverage of murders, suicides, and deadly tragedies makes an impact on our society. This is The Copycat Effect -- the phenomenon through which violent events spawn violence of the same type. From recognizing the emerging patterns of the Copycat Effect, to how we can deal with and counteract its consequences as individuals and as a culture, Loren Coleman has uncovered a tragic flaw of the information age -- a flaw which must be corrected before the next ripples of violence spread.
