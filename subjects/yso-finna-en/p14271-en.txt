The third Scandinavian demographic symposium 18-20 June 1973 in Tuusula, Finland
This book investigates the EU's regional growth dynamics and, in particular, the reasons why peripheral and socio-economically disadvantaged areas have persistently failed to catch up with the rest of the Union. It shows that the capability of the knowledge-based growth model to deliver its expected benefits to these areas crucially depends on tackling a specific set of socio-institutional factors which prevents innovation from being effectively translated into economic growth. The book takes an eclectic approach to the territorial genesis of innovation and regional growth by combining different theoretical strands into one model of empirical analysis covering the whole EU-25. An in-depth comparative analysis with the United States is also included, providing significant insights into the distinctive features of the European process of innovation and its territorial determinants. The evidence produced in the book is extensively applied to the analysis of EU development policies.

Vietnam is a developing country with a fast growing economy. With the Government s economics freedom renovation program starts to be effective, the private sector has been blooming. Despite this fact, Vietnam is still a country with many social problems, particularly poverty. For a long time, these social problems are largely targeted by development programs from non-profit organisations. A question arises, about whether businesses and development programs can be combined in order to tackle these problems. This thesis aims to show if this combination is possible or in other words, whether “social entrepreneurship” has the environment and conditions to spawn and grow in Vietnam.  The research looks at the social entrepreneurship field in Vietnamese in three aspects: the sources of social business opportunities, the organisation models of social entrepreneurship and the organisations which support the development of social entrepreneurship in Vietnam. In order to answer the research questions, a theoretical review was conducted about social entrepreneurship definitions, social business opportunity model and models of social entrepreneurship. Based on the theoretical framework, secondary data was gathered for the empirical analysis. The thesis is written as a market research for Feelovation, a Finnish start-up company that supports the development of social entrepreneurship through researching, training, consulting and coaching services. This research gives Feelovation a current view about the status of social entrepreneurship, as well as other social entrepreneurship promoters in Vietnam. From there recommendations about partnerships and how Feelovation should operate in Vietnam are presented.

"This book offers information and resources for users, including several new and enhanced chapters and images. It explores the ways in which economic relationships across space are established and maintained and the blurred line between economic processes and the social and cultural contexts in which they are embedded. The authors look at the role of social interaction in forming economic clusters, the role of gender and ethnicity in shaping economic processes, and finally the ways in which consumption processes are implicated in the identities of places and people"--
