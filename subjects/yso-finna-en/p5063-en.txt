This book is the result of a study of the numerous archaeological discoveries in Israel by the authors, as well as of many visits to museums and archaeological sites both in Israel and abroad over the past thirty years. Indeed, it is the absence of any research-work engaging with the art and cult in Roman Eretz Israel that relate to the deities of the Greek, Roman and Oriental pantheons, that led them to undertake this work. The methodology applied here, based on the various artistic media discussed, was selected in an attempt to respond to some of the questions and problems that arose in the course of the study. The authors' examination of the wealth of material, the study of the various artistic aspects and the religious and cultic rites, as well as of the attitude of the contemporary population towards their deities. Circa 500 pictures illustrate the deities executed in marble, basalt, bronze, sandstone, terracotta, and depicted in mosaic or on coins, glass and gems. They also show sacred sites, reconstructions, drawings and ground plans.

Summary: This book focuses on a period at the end of the nineteenth century when a group of artists, architects and designers found themselves linked by the search for a new Beauty. "The Aesthetic movement", as it came to be known, united romantic bohemians such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, along with maverick figures such as James McNeill Whistler. The book brings together the finest pictures, furniture and decorative arts of this extraordinary era, setting them in the context of this glittering cast of characters. This beautiful book also reveals how artists' houses and their extravagant lifestyles became the object of public fascination. The influence of the 'Palaces of Art' created by Rossetti and Morris, Lord Leighton and others led to a widespread revolution in architecture and interior decoration, while Oscar Wilde made his name promoting the idea of 'The House Beautiful'.

"Objects of worship are an aspect of the material dimension of lived religion in South Asia. The omnipresence of these objects and their use is a theme which cuts across the religious traditions in the pluralistic religious culture of the region. Divine power becomes manifest in the objects and for the devotees they may represent power regardless of religious identity. This book looks at how these objects dominate the religious landscape of South Asia, and how they are of significance not just to the religious but also the social life of the region. It shows how these objects are shaped by traditions of religious aesthetics and conceptual devices woven into webs of religious and social meaning and demonstrates how the objects have a living relationship with those who use them. It discusses how devotees relate to such objects in a number of ways, and that although they belong to various traditions, objects may attract people from different communities and can be contested. By analysing the specific qualities that make objects eligible for becoming living objects of worship, and demonstrating how the objects have a living relationship with those who use them, the book contributes to an understanding of the central significance of these objects in the religious and social life of South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of Asian Religion, South Asian Studies, Philosophy and Culture and Society"--
