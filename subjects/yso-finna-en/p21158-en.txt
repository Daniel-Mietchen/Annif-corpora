Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying numerous diseases of the central nervous system is of paramount importance to develop effective therapies and pharmaceutical agents. Cell to cell signal transduction lies within the foundation of healthy physiological function as well as countless disorders. Cellular signaling pathways traditionally initiate at the plasma membrane receptors capable of relaying an extracellular signal to the intracellular environment allowing a rapid response. In the last decade a specific transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor, GPR17, has been associated with such diseases as ischemia, multiple sclerosis and glioblastoma. It was demonstrated to have a degenerative effect on neuronal cells and a stimulating effect on white blood cells and myelin-producing cells of the brain. Yet, remarkably little is known about the precise pathway of its signaling. In this study attempts were made to unravel whether GPR17 receptor causes changes to normal function of essential cellular organelle, mitochondrion.   The effect of GPR17 on mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring the changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels generated and tightly regulated within mitochondria. The ROS levels were analyzed by staining GPR17-transfected cells with a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye. The fluorescence intensity was measured with a high-throughput microplate reader based technique.   This work established a connection between GPR17 receptor and mitochondrial ROS. The results demonstrate that activation of GPR17 with its effective agonist at normal and oxidative stress conditions leads to elevated ROS levels that contribute to cellular damage. It was shown that inhibition of GPR17 with its antagonist prevents generation of high ROS levels and its detrimental effects. It was concluded that targeting GPR17 with clinical antagonist drugs can alleviate ischemic injury to mitochondria. Furthermore, it was observed that GPR17 signalling pathway engages complex I of mitochondrial electron transport chain for signal transduction. Our work provides novel insights into GPR17 signalling pathway. Further research is required to validate our findings and discover yet unknown links in the biochemical chain of GPR17 signalling pathway. Keywords: GPR17, GPCR, mitochondria, signalling pathway, ischemia.

Mitochondria DNA variations are used in evolutionary genetics as markers of population history and geographical movement. Despite the popular use of the Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism in research, its mitochondrial DNA sequence variations are not known. Objection of this work is to find out what kind of mitochondrial DNA sequence variations is there to be found in PVM and PYR2 fruit fly lines.    Mitochondria DNAs from two Drosophila melanogaster wild type lines, PYR2 and PVM, were extracted using standard phenol: chloroform extraction and then amplified using Senger automatic DNA sequencing. The obtained sequences were compared with the Drosophila melanogaster Oregon-R sequence and with each other in order to find any sequence variation.    In this development project, while several sequence variations were confirmed in the PVM fly line, the mutations found in PYR2 were inconclusive since they could not be verified. The sequences obtained from this project are going to be integrated into a larger research project.
