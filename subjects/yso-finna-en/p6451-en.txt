This book contains 6 parts providing step-by-step guides to create easily beautiful graphics using the R package ggplot2. The first part provides a quick introduction to R and to the ggplot2 plotting system. From part II to IV, we show how to create and customize several graph types including: density plots, ECDF, QQ plots, scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, dot plots, strip charts, line plots, bar plots and pie charts. Part V covers how to change graphical parameters including: main title and axis labels; legend titles, position and appearance; colors; point shapes, colors and size; line types; axis limits and transformations: log and sqrt; axis ticks : customize tick marks and labels; themes and background colors; text annotations; adding straight lines to a plot: horizontal, vertical and regression lines; rotating a plot; facets: split a plot into a matrix of panels; and coordinate systems. Part VI describes some extensions of ggplot2 including: arranging multiple graphs on the same page, correlation matrix visualization and survival curves.
