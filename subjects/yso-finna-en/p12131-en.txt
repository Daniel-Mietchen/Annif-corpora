In recent years, the advent of MRI technology seems to have unlocked the secrets of the human mind, revealing the sources of our deepest desires, intentions, and fears. In this book, the authors argue that the explanatory power of brain scans in particular and neuroscience more generally has been vastly overestimated. Although acknowledging its tremendous potential, they believe that the overzealous application of the burgeoning field of brain science has put innocent people in jail, prevented addicts from healing themselves, and undermined notions of free will and responsibility

"Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a rapidly expanding imaging method in cardiology which provides unparalleled diagnostic information about the heart. It is, however, a complex technique, and though the availability of scanners is increasing quickly, the expertise required to perform the scans is limited. While no book is a substitute for experience, this handbook provides an invaluable guide to performing and interpreting the scans which should aid both new and experienced operators. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance is an indispensable guide to performing and interpreting CMR scans. What to look for, which sequences to include, how to acquire them, and how to interpret the images are all included in the handbook. The information is provided in a quick-reference, easy-to-use format with many images from real cases, and is designed to sit on the scanning console or in the office, providing a step-by-step guide to aid the CMR practitioner at every stage. All areas of cardiovascular imaging are covered, including tips and tricks for optimal imaging and how to avoid and spot artefacts. From patient safety to differential diagnoses of tricky images, to an easy to understand section on the science behind magnetic resonance, all aspects are covered in this concise yet comprehensive guide to this specialist area. Whether a novice or expert in the field, all readers should find this book a useful tool. It is an invaluable reference that no CMR department should be without"--Provided by publisher.

It is now possible to witness human brain activity while we are talking, reading, or thinking, thanks to revolutionary neuroimaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These groundbreaking advances have opened infinite fields of investigation--into such areas as musical perception, brain development in utero, and faulty brain connections leading to psychiatric disorders--and have raised unprecedented ethical issues. In Looking Inside the Brain, one of the leading pioneers of the field, Denis Le Bihan, offers an engaging account of the sophisticated interdisciplinary research in physics, neuroscience, and medicine that have led to the remarkable neuroimaging methods that give us a detailed look into the human brain. Introducing neurological anatomy and physiology, Le Bihan walks readers through the historical evolution of imaging technology--from the X-ray and CT scan to the PET scan and MRI--and he explains how neuroimaging uncovers afflictions like stroke or cancer and the workings of higher-order brain activities, such as language skills. Le Bihan also takes readers on a behind-the-scenes journey through NeuroSpin, his state-of-the-art neuroimaging laboratory, and goes over the cutting-edge scanning devices currently being developed. Considering what we see when we look at brain images, Le Bihan weighs what might be revealed about our thoughts and unconscious, and discusses how far this technology might go in the future. Beautifully illustrated in color, Looking Inside the Brain presents the trailblazing story of the scanning techniques that provide keys to previously unimagined knowledge of our brains and our selves. – WorldCat.

"Positioning in MRI is a clinical manual about the creation of magnetic resonance images. This manual focuses upon patient positioning and image planning. The manual is organised by body region and provides valuable insight into: Patient pathology on MRI ; Considerations when positioning both the patient and coil. Imaging planes ; Anatomical image alignment. This manual is a comprehensive highly visual reference to the planning and positioning of patients and coils in MR imaging. High quality imaging specific to patient pathology is encouraged through the focus on considerations specific to coil and patient placement and imaging plane selection."--Publisher's website.

Special features of the third edition: Coverage of the field, with comprehensive sections on examination procedures and technical requirements; histologic, clinical, and radiologic appearance of a wide range of breast pathologies; results of international screening studies; and much more. Nearly 1,200 clear radiographic images showing normal findings, benign and malignant disorders, and post-traumatic, post-surgical, and post-therapeutic changes to the breast. Innovations in digital mammography, tomosynthesis, and computer assisted detection (CAD); new chapters on imaging of implants, lesions of uncertain malignant potential, developing technologies; and more. A systematic, highly reproducible methodology for detection, diagnosis, and assessment of findings. Easy-to-follow flowcharts for the diagnostic work-up of both typical and atypical cases. Written by world-renowned authorities with decades of clinical experience, this book provides a brilliant orientation to the multimodality diagnostic approach and therapeutic significance of breast imaging findings. It is an essential reference and board review for radiologists, residents and fellows, gynecologists, oncologists, surgeons, technologists, and any other interdisciplinary specialist working to improve outcomes in breast disease"--Provided by publisher.

"Welcome to the third edition of Diagnostic Imaging: Spine. Five years have passed since the second edition, and 11 years have flown by since the first edition was published. This edition is a refresh with new images, new diagnoses, and updated text and references. The same excellent Amirsys formatting is present, with individual diagnoses capable of standing alone but with a logical integration within the larger sections. The Key Facts box retains its visual prominence at the beginning of each diagnosis, allowing for a quick scan of the most important bullet points when time is short (and when is it not?). The text format remains in the hallmark Diagnostic Imaging bulleted form that allows a large amount of important information to be displayed in an easy-to-use and inviting layout. Prose text chapters are included for the introduction to major sections, which are color coded, and the use of tables allows quick scanning for important data and measurements."--From the publisher.

"Edited by a renowned musculoskeletal radiologist and an internationally recognized Emergency Radiologist, and enhanced by contributions from invited acknowledged authorities, the Fifth Edition of this comprehensive reference is unsurpassed as a source of practical information on imaging of the acutely ill and injured patient during the acute phase of their emergent admission. Ideal for both the radiologist and for all members of the emergency team, the text builds upon current applications of plain-film radiography--while adding substantial coverage of other modalities, including MPCT and MRI. The fifth edition has again strived to keep up with the changing technology in diagnostic imaging in addition to emphasizing current practice in EDs and trauma centers. New chapters on imaging of skull fractures, maxillofacial trauma, chest trauma, and the acetabulum have been added to this volume to emphasize the importance of these areas with respect to imaging techniques and changes in clinical diagnosis and practice. In addition to redefining the importance of standard radiographs, the fifth edition has incorporated high-quality multidetector computed tomographic (CT) images, 3-D reformations, and magnetic resonance imaging to provide new information with evolving clinical practice" -- Provided by publisher.
