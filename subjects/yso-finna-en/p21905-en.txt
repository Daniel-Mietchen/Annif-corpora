In the course of their work the facilities manager will face a range of complex and often challenging tasks, sometimes concerned with a single business premises, often across an entire property portfolio. To help with those tasks, the "Facilities Manager's Desk Reference" provides the facilities manager with an invaluable source of highly relevant, practical information on all the principal FM services, as well as information on legal compliance issues, the development of strategic policies and tactical best practice information. With a clear practitioner perspective the book covers both hard and soft facilities management issues and is presented in an easily readable, concise format. "The Facilities Manager's Desk Reference" will be a first point of reference for all busy facilities managers and will save them time by providing access to the information needed to ensure the safe, effective and efficient running of any facilities function. It will also serve as a useful overview for students studying for their professional and academic qualifications in facilities management.
