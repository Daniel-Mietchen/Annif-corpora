This thesis is a review on the plant compounds possessing effective tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme found widely in micro-organisms, plants and animals. It acts as a catalyser in the enzymatic reaction leading to the forming of pigments in the organism. The inhibition of this enzymatic process has been the focus of extensive research due to the wide range of application of products inhibiting tyrosinase activity in the food and pharmaceutical industry, and even as agents for controlling insects. The potentially harmful side-effects of the agents used for controlling tyrosinase activity have led to the need  to find safe alternatives to the ones currently used. Natural sources of tyrosinase inhibitory compounds represent a possible source for finding safe and effective inhibitors that can also be produced economically viably. The thesis has been compiled from the on-line scientific databases mostly in the forms of scientific papers. As a result, 84 plant compounds from 50 plants belonging to 27 families were found to inhibit tyrosinase activity in the range of 100 Î¼M resulting in 50% inhibition of tyrosinase. The plants yielding the most potent inhibitors were Glycyrrhizia glabra, Sophora flavescens, Anacardium occidentale, Morus alba, Atrocarpus lakoocha, Rhododendron collettianum, Amberboa ramosa, Vitis vinifera, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Eucalyptus cneralifolia, Ecklonia stolonifera and Chamaecyparis taiwanensis. With further research on the safety and in vivo experiments on the plant compounds, the findings indicate that many plant derived compounds have prospects for future tyrosinase inhibiting applications.
