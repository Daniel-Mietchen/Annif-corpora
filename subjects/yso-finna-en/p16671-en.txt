The elements of biometry
Spreadsheet exercises in ecology and evolution
The purpose of this thesis was to build clear understanding biometrics and biometrics identifiers and also to look closely on the methods of biometrics. In this work such methods as data collecting, content analysis were applied. The information is taken from multiple internet resources, TV reports, magazines and newspapers and books. The study contains information about the history of biometrics and the process of its development, characteristics that people consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of biometrics, and also about two types of biometric identifiers and methods that belong to these types. The results of the study were the most popular methods of biometrics, their advantages and disadvantages.

"Statistical and Data Handling Skills in Biology gives you everything you need to master the often overlooked subject of statistical analysis. Written in a straight-forward and easy to understand style it presents all of the tests you will need throughout your studies, and shows you how to select the right tests to get the most out of your experiments. All of this is done in the context of biological examples so you can see just how relevant a skill this is, and how becoming fully proficient will make you a more rounded scientist." "This book is the ideal companion for biologists at all levels: as a text for undergraduate students; as a self-study guide; or as a laboratory handbook for the working biologist."--BOOK JACKET.

"Chapter 1 An introduction to next-generation biological platforms Virginia Mohlere, Wenting Wang, and Ganiraju Manyam The University of Texas. MD Anderson Cancer Center 1.1 Introduction When Sanger and Coulson first described a reliable, efficient method for DNA sequencing in 1975 (Sanger and Coulson, 1975), they made possible the full sequencing of both genes and entire genomes. Although the method was resource-intensive, many institutions invested in the necessary equipment, and Sanger sequencing remained the standard for the next 30 years. Refinement of the process increased read lengths from around 25 to 2 Mohlere, Wang, and Manyam almost 750 base pairs (Schadt et al., 2010, fig. 1). While this greatly increased efficiency and reliability, the Sanger method still required not only large equipment but significant human investment, as the process requires the work of several people. This prompted researchers and companies such as Applied Biosystems to seek improved sequencing techniques and instruments. Starting in the late 2000s, new instruments came on the market that, although they actually decreased read length, lessened run time and could be operated more easily with fewer human resources (Schadt et al., 2010). Despite discoveries that have illuminated new therapeutic targets, clarified the role of specific mutations in clinical response, and yielded new methods for diagnosis and predicting prognosis (Chin et al., 2011), the initial promise of genomic data has largely remained so far unfulfilled. The difficulties are numerous"--

This book is an introduction to mathematical biology for students with no experience in biology, but who have some mathematical background. The work is focused on population dynamics and ecology, following a tradition that goes back to Lotka and Volterra, and includes a part devoted to the spread of infectious diseases, a field where mathematical modeling is extremely popular. These themes are used as the area where to understand different types of mathematical modeling and the possible meaning of qualitative agreement of modeling with data. The book also includes a collections of problems designed to approach more advanced questions. This material is addressed to students in their fourth year of studies in Mathematics. It can also be used as a reference as it provides up-to-date developments in several areas.
Statistical learning for biomedical data
Practical statistics for the biological sciences : simple pathways to statistical analyses
"The concept of frailty offers a convenient way to introduce unobserved heterogeneity and associations into models for survival data. In its simplest form, frailty is an unobserved random proportionality factor that modifies the hazard function of an individual or a group of related individuals. Frailty Models in Survival Analysis presents a comprehensive overview of the fundamental approaches in the area of frailty models. The book extensively explores how univariate frailty models can represent unobserved heterogeneity. It also emphasizes correlated frailty models as extensions of univariate and shared frailty models. The author analyzes similarities and differences between frailty and copula models; discusses problems related to frailty models, such as tests for homogeneity; and describes parametric and semiparametric models using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. He also shows how to apply the models to real data using the statistical packages of R, SAS, and Stata. The appendix provides the technical mathematical results used throughout. Written in nontechnical terms accessible to nonspecialists, this book explains the basic ideas in frailty modeling and statistical techniques, with a focus on real-world data application and interpretation of the results. By applying several models to the same data, it allows for the comparison of their advantages and limitations under varying model assumptions. The book also employs simulations to analyze the finite sample size performance of the models."--Publisher's description.

Multibiometrics for human identification
"In today's security-conscious society, real-world applications for authentication or identification require a highly accurate system for recognizing individual humans. The required level of performance cannot be achieved through the use of a single biometric such as face, fingerprint, ear, iris, palm, gait, or speech. Fusing multiple biometrics enables the indexing of large databases, more robust performance, and enhanced coverage of populations. Multiple biometrics are also naturally more robust against attacks than single biometrics. This book addresses a broad spectrum of research issues on multibiometrics for human identification, ranging from sensing modes and modalities to fusion of biometric samples and combination of algorithms. It covers publicly available multibiometrics databases, theoretical and empirical studies on sensor fusion techniques in the context of biometrics authentication, identification, and performance evaluation and prediction"--
