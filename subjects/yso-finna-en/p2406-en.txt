Tracking what is happening on a website in realtime is invaluable. The objective of this thesis was to start and launch the first version of Snowfinch, an open source realtime web analytics application. The thesis report contains up-to-date fundamentals of web analytics; reasoning behind the most important and difficult technical decisions in the project; product development methodologies; and an overview of the resulting application. Understanding visitors is the key to a site's success. Research shows that the amount of insights provided by clickstream data is small in comparison to the amount of data gathered. Even though there is much more to web analytics than clickstream data, the fact is that it is the only data that can be collected and analyzed exclusively by software, thus the need to optimize its use. With the current use and importance of social media, being able to act quickly is a business differentiator. Visualizing data in realtime is crucial to a fast response. Choosing an appropriate data store plays an important role in the overall performance, responsiveness, and development time of the system. The development work was sponsored by Kisko Labs Oy. Snowfinch will be used both internally and in client projects. During the development period, it has tracked over half a million page views and approximately two hundred thousand visitors. Snowfinch may be used by anyone as it is, or it can act as a solid foundation on which to build customized functionality. Being free and deployable inside a private network offers a competitive advantage over commercial alternatives. The fundamental technologies used are the Ruby programming language, the Ruby on Rails web framework, and the MongoDB document-oriented database. The project was released under the MIT license, a permissive and free software license approved by the OSI (Open Source Initiative).
Storm applied : strategies for real-time event processing
This book offers over 400 accounts from a wide range of specific research efforts on methodologies, tools, and architectures for complex distributed systems that address the practical issues of performance guarantees, timed execution, real-time management of resources, synchronized communication under various load conditions, satisfaction of QoS constraints, as well as dealing with the trade-offs between these aspects (Publisher's description)

Real-time agility : the harmony/ESW method for real-time and embedded systems development
An important resource, this book offers an introduction and overview of real-time systems: systems where <i>timeliness</i> is a crucial part of the correctness of the system. It contains a pragmatic overview of key topics (computer architecture and organization, operating systems, software engineering, programming languages, and compiler theory) from the perspective of the real-time systems designer and is organized into chapters that are essentially self-contained. In addition, each chapter contains both basic and more challenging exercises that will help the reader to confront actual problems.
