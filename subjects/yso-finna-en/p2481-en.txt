"Intergenerational Space offers insight into the transforming relationships between younger and older members of contemporary societies. The chapter selection brings together scholars from around the world in order to address pressing questions both about the nature of contemporary generational divisions as well as the complex ways in which members of different generations are (and can be) involved in each other's lives. These questions include: how do particular kinds of spaces and spatial arrangements (e.g. cities, neighbourhoods, institutions, leisure sites) facilitate and limit intergenerational contact and encounters? What processes and spaces influence the intergenerational negotiation and contestation of values, beliefs, and social memory, producing patterns of both continuity and change? And if generational separation and segregation are in fact significant social problems across a range of contexts--as a significant body of research and commentary attests--how can this be ameliorated? The chapters in this collection make original contributions to these debates drawing on original research from Belgium, China, Finland, Poland, Senegal, Singapore, Tanzania, Uganda, the United States and the United Kingdom."--

"This book offers a new and surprising perspective on the evolution of cities across the Roman Empire in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages (third to ninth centuries AD). It suggests that the tenacious persistence of leading cities across most of the Roman world is due, far more than previously thought, to the persistent inclination of kings, emperors, caliphs, bishops, and their leading subordinates to manifest the glory of their offices on an urban stage, before crowds of city dwellers. Long after the dissolution of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, these communal leaders continued to maintain and embellish monumental architectural corridors established in late antiquity, the narrow but grandiose urban itineraries, essentially processional ways, in which their parades and solemn public appearances consistently unfolded. Hendrik W. Dey's approach selectively integrates urban topography with the actors who unceasingly strove to animate it for many centuries"--

Richard Sorabji here takes time as his central theme, exploring fundamental questions about its nature: Is it real or an aspect of consciousness? Did it begin along with the universe? Can anything escape from it? Does it come in atomic chunks? In addressing these and myriad other issues, Sorabji engages in an illuminating discussion of early thought about time, ranging from Plato and Aristotle to Islamic, Christian, and Jewish medieval thinkers. Sorabji argues that the thought of these often negelected philosophers about the subject is, in many cases, more complete than that of their more recent counterparts.

The objective of this research was to evaluate Nokia's International Employer Brand during the fall of 2012. Recently, the mobile industry has faced intensive competition in terms of recruitment for the best talent. Nokia has faced some difficulties, such as losing its market leadership and facing some remarkable financial turbulence. In February 2011, the company announced a new strategy and since then Nokia's situation has changed dramatically. On June 14, 2012 a reshaped strategy was announced, and this has affected 10,000 employees worldwide. This study evaluated the perception of Nokia' employer brand based on the opinions of different groups (former employees, people working for Nokia and people who have never worked for Nokia). First, the study explores the importance of employer brand categories and attributes. Moreover, the study evaluates Nokia's performance. The study describes the gap between people's expectations and Nokia's offering. The attributes of the employer brand were created based on previous theoretical models adapted to Nokia's situation. The data was collected in September 2012 using an online survey which was sent to the respondents using different social media channels. In total, 216 people from 34 different countries answered the survey. It was found that Nokia's employer brand consists of eight categories and Nokia's overall employer brand remains good. There are some differences in terms of perception depending on respondents' relation to the company. Former employees' perceptions are more negative than those of other groups. The employees' perception is from neutral to positive. Outsiders' perception is the most positive one. Nokia weakest performance was related to leadership and management, HR processes and development opportunities.
