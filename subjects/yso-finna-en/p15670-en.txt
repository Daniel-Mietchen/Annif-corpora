Tutors as mediators of exchange student experiences : evaluation of the interantional student tutor system at the University of Turku
A group of Finnish teachers and students visited Fontys University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands.

Benchmarking worksheet proved to be a useful tool for comparing activities. The project created multi-disciplinary cooperation, mainly because there were both teachers, students and the members of the support staff participating to the project. Student involvement was crucial to the success of the project.
