Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Western industrialized countries. Approximately 60% of prostate cancer patients receive radiotherapy at some phase of the disease, a treatment based on the use of ionizing radiation to kill or control malignant cells. Unfortunately, adjoining healthy tissues are also affected by exposure to ionization, potentially leading to the emergence of adverse side effects, even several years later. The main radiation treatment modalities are external radiotherapy and low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Different techniques and methods are used to decrease the dose to healthy tissues, thus limiting the possibility of adverse effects. In this thesis a novel technique and associated equipment were developed whereby brachytherapy can be performed by inserting all needles simultaneously. This reduces the implantation time, thus minimizing the impairing effect on seed positioning accuracy resulting from prostate swelling. A phantom model was also constructed for testing and training purposes. DuraSeal® was investigated as a spacer material between the prostate and rectum, and its effect on rectal dose was evaluated during brachytherapy and external radiotherapy. DuraSeal® is resorbed over one to six months, thus altering rectal doses compared with the original dose plan. In brachytherapy, the resorption effect on rectal doses was calculated along with an evaluation of the potential of using different isotopes. In external radiotherapy, the resorption effect on rectal dose-volume histograms (DVHs) was calculated and the need for adaptive planning considered. DuraSeal®, as a spacer gel, clearly has favorable effects on rectal and anterior rectal wall DVHs in brachytherapy and external radiotherapy, and has the potential to decrease adverse effects. It is especially beneficial in hypofractionated treatments and external radiotherapy and brachytherapy combination treatment. In LDR brachytherapy using permanent seeds, dose planning is recommended prior to gel injection to prevent excessive rectal tolerance doses in situations where gel is rapidly resorbed. In external radiotherapy, the use of adaptive planning with a spacer gel improves rectal DVH, but is not necessary according to this thesis.

Recent Advances in Prolactin Research summarizes the current knowledge of prolactin (PRL), PRL receptor, PRL-dependent signaling pathways, the role of PRL in oncogenesis and PRL crosstalk with other oncogenic factors. The chapters are written by experts in these fields and focus on identifying and reviewing timely experimental findings that provide new insights into the expanding role of PRL in the pathophysiology associated with a variety of human conditions. Prolactin is a peptide hormone that is best known for its role in lactation. Prolactin also has an influence on hematopoiesis and angiogenesis, and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. Although PRL was discovered more than 80 years ago, the understanding of PRL signaling and its relationship to various pathologies is still very incomplete. PRL is not only a pituitary hormone with an important role in reproduction, but PRL also acts as a cytokine, modulating a wide variety of physiological processes. For example, data gathered during the last decade have demonstrated that locally produced PRL acts as the autocrine/paracrine factor and plays a contributory role during breast oncogenesis. In fact, the scientific and clinical communities have suggested that the manipulation of the PRL axis may lead to the successful treatment of breast cancer. However, recent work has demonstrated that the role of the PRL axis is much more complex than first envisaged.

This proceedings volume will contain chapters based upon the presentation of the 2nd International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer in Colorado, 2013. The various topics explore the affects of alcohol on: liver and breast cancer, cell signaling and cancer, stem cells, biomarkers and metabolomics, aerodigestive cancers, cancer and the immune system, and more. In the recent years, a significant amount of research has emerged connecting the link between alcohol and cancer. The field has rapidly advanced, especially since the complex connection between alcohol and cancer has several unique sub areas that are being investigated and this volume gives a comprehensive overview of these advancements.
