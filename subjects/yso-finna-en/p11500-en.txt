Advanced myofascial techniques. Volume 1, Shoulder, pelvis, foot and leg
Magnetic resonance imaging of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
This volume is a reference handbook focusing on diseases like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and other heritable soft connective tissue diseases. The book presents detailed information for both basic scientists and for clinicians seeing patients. It is also a stepping stone for new investigations and studies that goes beyond the facts about the composition and biochemistry of the connective tissue and extracellular matrix, as the authors connect individual components to specific aspects of various soft tissue disorders and to the actual or potential treatment of them. Progress in Heritable Soft Connective Tissue Diseases features very prominent physicians and scientists as contributors who bring their most recent discoveries to the benefit of readers. Their expertise will help clinicians with proper diagnosis of sometimes elusive and uncommon heritable diseases of soft connective tissues. This book also offers an update on the pathophysiology of these diseases, including an emphasis on unifying aspects such as connections between embryonic development of the different types of connective tissues and systems, and the role of TGF-beta in development and physiology of soft tissues. This new set of data explains, at least in part, why many of these disorders are interconnected, though the primary pathophysiological events, such as gene mutations, may be different for each disorder." -- (Back Cover)

The fasciae : anatomy, dysfunction and treatment
"In 1929 Germany, physiotherapist Elisabeth Dicke suffered from poor circulation in her right leg, acute back pain, and a host of other ailments. With no medical options offered beyond amputation of the leg, she turned to her own training for help. She began to massage the skin and subcutaneous fascia of the sacral bone and pelvic crest with pulling strokes. After several applications, she experienced less back pain, increased circulation to the leg, and within three months, disappearance of all symptoms. This was the beginning of Dickes systematic, scientifically based treatment method of connective tissue massage (or Bindegewebsmassage), now in wide use throughout the world. In this book, practitioners will get the first detailed, how-to description of connective tissue massage (CTM) {in the English language} including the principles, knowledge, and skills to implement it. Special Features: Begins with the origin and practical benefits of CTM, including its neuroanatomical and neurophysiological basis, Explores the relationship between the sensory, motor, and autonomic nervous systems and the complex reflex mechanisms that are activated by CTM therapy, Describes and illustrates specific stroking techniques that trigger the appropriate neural reflexes in every body segment, Shows how to make a diagnostic assessment based on skin, connective tissue, and muscle zones, Covers the full range of orthopedic, neurological, internal medicine, and gynecologic disorders that can be effectively treated with CTM. Complete with treatment plans, indications and contraindications, and modern medical guidelines, this book is essential for all physical and massage therapists and osteopaths who want to successfully integrate CTM into their practices. It is also a fascinating reference for physicians and other medical professionals who are interested in learning more about this important manual technique.__"--Provided by publisher.
