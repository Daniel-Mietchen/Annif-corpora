Recruitment and understorey herb dynamics in deciduous and mixed coniferous forest
Herbivory-related variation in the foliar chemistry of the mountain birch (Betula pubescens spp. czerepanovii)
Field and ground layer vegetation in birch forests after Oporinia damage
The development of the field and ground layer vegetation in Oporinia damage areas of 1960's in Utsjoki was studied analyzing 6 fenced areas and corresponding control areas in 1970, 1973 and 1978...
Abstract: In 1965-1966 the caterpillars of the geometrid Oporinia autumnata defoliated vast areas of birch forests in Finnish Lapland. The damage areas in Utsjoki, the northernmost district of Finland, were studied more thoroughly. About 1350 kmÂ² were defoliated and large areas of this will be changed into treeless "tundra"...
