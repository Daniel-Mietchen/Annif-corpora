Quality Control for Technical Documentation
"Preface In Walden, Henry Thoreau asserts that "Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written." Given the serious and highly technical nature of formal engineering writing, any reader of such writing would be wise to follow Thoreau's advice. The purpose of the present book, however, is to speak to the engineering writer. Our basic premise is that engineering material should be written as deliberately and carefully as it will be read. Engineers are smart people and their work is important. Their writing should not be inaccurate, vague, ambiguous, or otherwise opaque. To a great extent, modern engineering is an extension of science and mathematics and is therefore amenable to clear and logical exposition. Some aspects of engineering remain more art than science, to be sure. We would argue, however, that in such cases it is especially important for engineers to write precisely, as readers will be in less of a position to close expository gaps through deductive reasoning. In other words, clear description is just as important in technical writing as clear argumentation. Technical subjects can make for difficult reading as it is. A reader should not have to go over a passage again and again, finally being forced to guess whether the writer was attempting to motivate a viewpoint, describe something that already exists, describe something that could conceivably exist, draw a conclusion from known facts, persuade, or something else. Yet, a writer who approaches the writing task carelessly, by simply accumulating a pile of words and equations, may produce just that sort of confusion"--

Genre theory in the past few years has contributed immensely to our understanding of the way discourse is used in academic, professional and institutional contexts. However, its development has been constrained by the nature and design of its applications, which have invariably focused on language teaching and learning, or communication training and consultation. This has led to the use of simplified and idealised genres. In contrast to this, the real world of discourse is complex, dynamic and unpredictable. This tension between the real world of written discourse and its representation in app.

Writing skills for public relations : style and technique for mainstream and social media
Walter J. Ong's classic work provides a fascinating insight into the social effects of oral, written, printed and electronic technologies, and their impact on philosophical, theological, scientific and literary thought. This thirtieth anniversary edition - coinciding with Ong's centenary year - reproduces his best-known and most influential book in full and brings it up to date with two new exploratory essays by cultural writer and critic John Hartley. Hartley provides: A scene-setting chapter that situates Ong's work within the historical and disciplinary context of post-war Americanism and the rise of communication and media studies; A closing chapter that follows up Ong's work on orality and literacy in relation to evolving media forms, with a discussion of recent criticisms of Ong's approach, and an assessment of his concept of the 'evolution of consciousness'; Extensive references to recent scholarship on orality, literacy and the study of knowledge technologies, tracing changes in how we know what we know. These illuminating essays contextualize Ong within recent intellectual history, and display his work's continuing force in the ongoing study of the relationship between literature and the media, as well as that of psychology, education and sociological thought.
A sense of audience in written communication
Bringing together selected contributions from linguistics and literary studies, this book focuses on the variegated manifestations of wordplay in different communicative settings. By investigating basic techniques and ludic traditions, it looks on the metalinguistic/metadiscursive dimension of wordplay and on its various kinds of interplays.
