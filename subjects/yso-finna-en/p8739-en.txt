Mathcad5.0 : user's guide
The aim of this thesis is to define possible drive situations in the linked operation of large air film movers, analyse these situations mathematically, construct methods of calculating correct control values for drive units involved, use results in writing automation software to be used for mover control using Siemens STEP7 software package. Formulas and mathematical methods are presented and discussed. Examples of their realisation in the SCL programming language are shown as is simulation and testing of the proposed code
