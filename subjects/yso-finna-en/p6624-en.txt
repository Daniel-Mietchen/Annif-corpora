What is a virtual service? - Broadening the perspective on technology-based services
PlanMill Cloud is an online, subscription-based B2B product which supports service-based companies' business processes such as project management, employee time reporting and customer billing. PlanMill recognized a need for more efficient generic automation within its infrastructure. With increasing demands, especially in northern Europe for businesses to use electronic invoicing there was urgency for an automated setup and configuration of PlanMill's online services with a reliable electronic invoicing operator.      As a part of the 14.1 Version release on 22.9.2011 PlanMill's goal was to completely automate the registration, settings, verification and enabling of electronic invoice sending (which includes printing and other services offered by the operators). The chosen operator was 'Maventa' – a locally based and emerging player in the e-Invoice market. The integration would take advantage of Maventa's comprehensive open API web service (Bravo version).      This report describes the architecture and explains the methods to be used. It then follows the requirements gathering, creation of user stories and corresponding Behaviour Driven Development models (BDD's), selection and requirements testing of the API methods and Maventa's class libraries with JSP tools, data mapping between to the two systems, and finally the refinement of the development BDD's into useful cross-browser test cases. Due to some resource restrictions and the version release deadline the project made some compromises for a less functional first-release of the feature.     An appropriate new UI would need to be designed to implement the BDD's within PlanMill's Java-based factory model architecture. The Java implementation was to be primarily undertaken by a senior developer utilizing the results of the JSP tests and in accordance to the BDD's. Any UI layer applied business rules would be handled by JavaScript and be the responsibility of the author.

On-going change in film consumption : is online availability disrupting the offline markets?
Abstract: On-going change in film consumption - Is online availability disrupting the offline markets? The objective of this study was to look into the online film services in Finland and the theories connected to offering that type of online services. The aim was also to look into these services from the point of view of their disruptiveness to the market. A research was conducted to find out the current status of these online film distributors in Finland from the point of view of the customers. The research was mainly of quantitative nature and it was conducted as an online survey. The survey was answered by 123 people and in addition three persons were interviewed to gather more specific experiences and opinions on certain matters. The research revealed that most of the respondents would be willing to try online film services in the future but only few already had experience in using them. Currently more people seem to rather find films from illegal sources to download or prefer to watch them from DVD's or Blu-rays. The research also gave implications that purchasing content online is not a novelty for people anymore and what seems to keep people from using these online services are preconceptions on, for example, their quality and pricing.
E-commerce is growing fast with the fast development of internet and communication technology. Now E-commerce brings the businesses a world wide market and a huge population of protential csutomer. For customers the price information is more transparent and there are much more buying choices than before. Online businesses are competeing for customers on a word wide market like never before. The customer retention gained increased value among the E-commerc businesses. But the research of  customer retention in E-commerce context remain limited.     This thesis is aimed to investgate the concrete influenc factors of customer retention in an E-commerce context.    After reviewed existing theories, the author developed a conceptual framework about factors affect the customer retention in E-commerce context. Then a questionnaire is used to find out the real customer attitude of these factors.     As the result 13 concrete influence factors (Reliability, Responsiveness, Contact Points, Convenience, Merchandising, Site design, Security, Service ability, Customization, Contact Interactivity, Cultivation, Care, Community ) were presented for E-commerce business customer retention. Also this thesis brefily discussed about the constructs of customer retention.    This thesis could be used as a reference for the E-commerce business owner for meansuring their E-commerce sit  or improve the customer retention rate of their business. Also could be used by student or  researcher who is studying or interested in the topic of online customer retention.

The Internet of Things is all about machines trading with machines - your fridge orders groceries; your car, fuel; your television, entertainment; and so on. However, machines cannot trade with machines if it's expensive and slow. Would you really want your TV to order the next season of Games of Thrones, if the payment took ten days and cost 25 or more? Unfortunately with the way the bank system works today, that is the problem we face today. As a result, we need an Internet of Value to work with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Value - or ValueWeb, for short - allows machines to trade.

The ways corporations build their applications has changed dramatically over the last  decades. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been the latest buzz in software  development. If someone had declared twenty-something years ago that the piece of code  that was being used in a financial application could be reused in a human resources  application, he/she would have been laughed out of the office. Yet, this is a reality in the  21st century.  Rounding up all the functions of applications that perform exactly the same thing, and  having just one occurrence of it, and making it available for all instead of having all similar  functionalities limited by borders, is not just cost effective but it decreases man hours spent  on developing new applications. Alongside with service-oriented architecture come new  concepts to developing such as loose coupling, reusing, services, and interoperable. The one  concept that seems to be most interesting is that functions, or services as they are named in  service-oriented architecture, are platform- and language-independent therefore available for  everyone to use.  After being introduced with service-oriented architecture, I wanted to investigate it more  deeply. As I read more about it, questions rose up: “How to develop a simple service?”, "Is  service-oriented architecture perceived differently in business than in IT?" and "How can  service-oriented architecture help bring business and IT together?" This thesis tries to find  answers to those questions through research. Also to help with this, is a case study where a  reusable service is developed and an experiment where business processes and reusable  services are being connected to each other.  The project was carried out between November 2008 and July 2009. Implementing SOA is  challenging but the results of this pilot show that it is worth the while, even though this  project developed only a simple service.

Abstract: Metadata driven data utilization in ecommerce solution. The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to develop a proof of concept with SharePoint for ecommerce site that uses search index to provide data. The study concentrated in evaluating features that are seen important in online commerce web sites and how their implementations would suffice in the application platform, which has seen little use in online commerce. As a result an ecommerce site that utilizes SharePoint 2013 features to fulfill common ecommerce site requirements as well as possible was created. The site uses search index as data provider for the customer site and it has a separate site for product administration that is indexed. The project required architectural research and understanding of metadata and its use in search services for creating queries and faceted navigation. The project application platform was found to include many metadata enhanced search functionalities. Ecommerce features were found existing and working but lacking for extensive use. As products are queried from search index there are insufficient information about user preferences or behavior for personalized product promotions. Missing shopping cart functionality was also noted. Search functions described in this project can be used to develop search-driven content utilization also with other content types.

The objective of this thesis was to develop an online service for travelers who'd like to meet other travelers while on the go. The development process covered the software analysis, design and implementation of the system. TravelersAround is an online service provided to travelers around the world, who would like to spontaneously meet fellow travelers or even the locals, without any need to plan anything in advance. Many times, travelers decide to go on a trip alone, because none of their friends were available at that time or they couldn't find common interest for the same destination. That's where TravelersAround comes in. As a solo traveler, you would benefit the most out of it. Travelers log onto the system and receive a report of fellow travelers around their current location. The report is shown in real-time and provides up-to-date information. The system was developed in a short time and therefore includes the core features and functions, such as: searching for fellow online travelers in the area, sending and receiving messages, profile status updates and managing friends list. These features will provide the building block of the system's further development. Future development will feature mobile phone application for the popular smart phones in the market. The system was developed in C# programming language, .NET Framework 4.0 and SQL Server 2008 and released under the MIT OSI license. In addition, several third party open source libraries were used (refer to the Appendix 2 : Software Design documentation for the full list).
