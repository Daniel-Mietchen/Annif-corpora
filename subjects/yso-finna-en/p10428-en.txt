"This study of the design, manufacture and use of medieval floor tiles shows the long-lasting influence achieved in the north of England by the monasteries of the reformed movement, particularly the Cistercians. It serves to demonstrate how these monastic houses made use of the resources and contacts available to them." "Over 500 different designs and 60 mosaic arrangements that had been in use in the medieval period were identified from the extant tiles and from searches of published literature and antiquarian records. The study examines changes in the design, production and use of a particular artefact type, in a large region, over a long period of time."--BOOK JACKET.

This totally original architecture book, the first ever comprehensive study of brick, follows the story of brick from 5,000 bc to its use in building today, via the vast baths and basilicas of ancient Rome, through the wonders of Gothic brick in Germany, the majestic temples of Pagan and Mughal mosques in Iran, to its modern revival. Marvellously illustrated with spectacular, specially taken photographs, Brick is at once an historical account of how bricks have been employed by architects of every period, a technical survey of brickmaking and bricklaying, and an essay in architectural and cultural history. The authors have applied their expert visual and technical knowledge to more than one hundred themes, from bricks in ancient Egypt to their distinctive use by such modern masters as Louis Kahn, Alvar Aalto and Renzo Piano. Great works of engineering, viaducts, tunnels and bridges are given prominence alongside great cathedrals and country houses, temples and mosques, testifying to the incredible versatility and importance of bricks and brickwork
