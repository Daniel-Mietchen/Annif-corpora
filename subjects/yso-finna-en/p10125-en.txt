A rapidly changing and expanding livestock and poultry production sector is causing a range of environmental problems on local, regional and global scales. Animal Manure Recycling: Treatment and Management presents an accessible overview of environmentally friendly technologies for managing animal manure more efficiently and in a sustainable manner. This book describes the physical and chemical characteristics of animal manure and microbial processes,featuring detailed examples and case studies showing how this knowledge can be used in practice.

The "green" or environmental sustainability movement has taken hold throughout the world. Its staying power is confirmed by the fact that environmental emphasis in organizations did not decrease during the recent global recession, but rather increased. Organizations see that greater environmental emphasis in their product and service offerings not only helps their image, but also may reduce inefficiency, waste, and corresponding cost. However, since most organizations rely heavily on their supply base for providing components, materials, and services that become part of their final products, organizations must revisit their sourcing processes and choices to have a real impact on the environment.
