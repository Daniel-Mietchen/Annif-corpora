Self-Organizing Routing Protocol for Bluetooth Low Energy Sensor Networks
Testing of VoIP security problems is essential to enterprises providing real-time data and services. The critical infrastructure can be compromised and data to be regularly exposed. This information may be used by malicious hackers for illegal purposes. At the same time consumers are connecting their smartphones and other personal devices to the network. The business with private and secured data is becoming more and more important in our everyday life. The major security threat for enterprises today is discovering existing unknown vulnerabilities from used software. Unknown vulnerabilities may cause a lot of serious problems, attacks utilizing security holes may continue undetected (while customer safety is compromised) and the repair process tends to be slow once an attack is detected. Additionally, during maintenance there is downtime when customer services are not accessible. Naturally, all downtime is damaging company reputation and eventually affecting to company profits. Security related bugs are likely to exist in platforms when facing with new technologies which are complex to implement and when software versions are often a released detriment of testing. Also, an increasing number of vulnerabilities have not been published but instead those may end to be used and shared within underground hacker communities. Companies and enterprises need to find preventive actions to protect their products and services because it takes too much time to wait fixed software releases from vendors. In this thesis work the protocol model from a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is implemented using the Codenomicon Test Tool platform. The product can send valid and anomalous data transmissions to the test application over the Internet. This is technique (or testing method) called fuzzing or fuzz testing. Software robustness can be verified and unknown or zero-day vulnerabilities may be found with fuzzing. RTP data is typically audio, video or other streaming content. RTP data (or media stream) is usually transferred and embedded within another protocol. The SRTP Test Suite can utilize other Codenomicon test tools to do media signaling negotiation with the test targets in a way which is secure when it comes to cryptography. Thus, the result of the connection parameters may be used to get connected with a wider variety of test targets and send an SRTP fuzzing data stream to these applications.

Abstract: Currently UPM plywood production has a tailor made reporting platform that handles all production related data. This reporting platform is called PlyNET and it is based on Mi-crosoft SQL Reporting Services (SSRS) technology. PlyNET platform is fully developed by the UPM IT-department and in the long run that could cause problems concerning product support and future development. During 2011-2012 UPM has implemented a standard MES solution for plywood production based on GE Intelligent Platforms' Proficy product family. This system is called PlyMES. the Proficy platform includes standard out-of-the-box reports, but these reports were found to be insufficient and needed to be extended or replaced. To be able to extend PlyMES reports and merge these with existing PlyNET reports, Novotek Report Plus (NRP) reporting tool was chosen as a candidate. Like PlyNET, the NRP platform is also based on standard SQL Server Reporting Services (SRSS) technology. Using NRP, UPM specific reports based on data in the PlyMES system can be designed and existing PlyNET reports can be merged together with PlyMES reports into single reporting portal. The goal of this thesis is to explore the possibility to use Novotek Report Plus as a single reporting portal for PlyMES and PlyNET reports. Alongside of this project WIP inventory balance, plywood average thickness and produced plywood quantity reports will be de-signed and created.

Introduction to Communication was developed to help hearing-impaired high school students understand hearing loss and the ways it affects their communication with others. The course is designed to help them develop strategies and find resources for building communication skills. Students also explore various cultural aspects of deafness. This curriculum was developed by classroom teachers, and is addressed to other classroom teachers who work with similar students, requirements, and teaching situations in their everyday lives. It provides practical, useful information and activities designed to increase student confidence in and enjoyment of human communication.
