David Icke marks his 20th year of uncovering astounding secrets and suppressed information with the publication of his most amazing book yet: Human Race Get off Your Knees : The Lion Sleeps No More. He takes the manipulation of the human race and the nature of reality to still new levels of understanding and he calls for humanity to rise from its knees and take back the world from the sinister network of families and non-human entities that covertly control us from cradle to grave. His most staggering revelation is that the Earth and the collective human mind is manipulated from the Moon, which, he says, is not a 'heavenly body, but an artificial construct - a gigantic 'spacecraft' (probably a hollowed-out 'planetoid') - which is home to the extraterrestrial group that has been manipulating humanity for aeons. Humanity is at a fork in the road and it is time to make a choice. Are we going to awaken to our true genius and potential as Infinite Consciousness? Or are we going to remain entrapped in body/mind and the manufactured illusions of the Moon Matrix? It is time to shake off the shackles, stop being Pavlov's dogs and grab reality by the balls and wake up to who we are truly meant to be.

Near the end of the last Ice Age, a giant comet caused a global cataclysm, wiping out Earth's earliest civilization, a second soon followed.

But, the comet that wrought such destruction may not be done yet. An astronomical message encoded at Gobekli Tepe, and in Egypt's Sphinx, warns that the 'Great Return' will occur in this time.

Negative aspects of the information society were first noticed in early 90's, with the dawning of the Internet era. The article gives an overview of European initiatives undertaken and European courts' judgments delivered over the last two decades, contrasting them with eminent U.S. Supreme Court decisions. According to the author, predominance of soft law, case law and self-regulation does not in itself impede protection, given that all stakeholders act with the intention to effectively monitor and eradicate threats..

"Through the pages of The Biology of Civilisation, Stephen Boyden is able to show that the worldview and priorities of the world's current dominant culture are simply not compatible with the long-term survival of civilisation. He argues that a shift to an ecologically sustainable and equitable society will not take place without a major transformation in our dominant culture, a 'cultural renaissance'. He concludes the book by suggesting measures that can be taken right now to make this happen." "The Biology of Civilisation will appeal to readers who are interested in issues of human health and wellbeing, ecological and economics sustainability, and the future of our society."--BOOK JACKET.
