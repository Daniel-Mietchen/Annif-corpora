gratitude
On New Year's Eve, journalist and former Parade editor-in-chief Janice Kaplan makes a promise to be grateful and look on the bright side of whatever happens. She realizes that how she feels over the next months will have less to do with the events that occur than with her own attitude and perspective. Getting advice at every turn from psychologists, academics, doctors and philosophers, Kaplan embarks on a smart, witty and insightful journey that will empower readers to think positively and start living their own best year ever.
