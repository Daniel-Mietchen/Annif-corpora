The capability approach acknowledges the role of institutions in limiting the capabilities of individuals, but does not analyse the institutional mechanisms involved. The institutional approach that is proposed ascribes a crucial role to knowledge and learning for two reasons: one, learning is essential for understanding the capability context of individuals; and, two, it is part of the process of overcoming restrictive institutions. This book argues that the capability approach can be strengthened by explicitly incorporating institutions.

Summary: "Moeran and Christensen examine evaluative practices in the creative industries by exploring the processes surrounding the conception, design, manufacture, appraisal and use of creative goods. The book describes the editorial choices made by different participants in a 'creative world', as they go about conceiving, composing or designing, performing or making, selling and assessing a range of cultural products. The study draws upon ethnographically rich case studies from companies as varied as Bang and Olufsen, Hugo Boss and Lonely Planet, in order to reveal the broad range of factors guiding and inhibiting creative processes. Some of these constraints are material and technical; others social or defined by aesthetic norms. The authors explore how these various constraints affect creative work and how ultimately they contribute to the development of creativity"--.

The current U.S. reset policy with Russia involves efforts to blaze a path of mutual cooperation on arms control and proliferation. In arms control, we see determined administration attempts to promote greater nuclear reductions in the direction of nuclear zero, including reductions in tactical nuclear weapons. This necessarily leads Moscow to raise issues of missile defense in Europe that it vehemently opposes. This monograph analyzes Russia's position on these arms control issues and examines the chances for the United States to achieve its arms control goals in the foreseeable future. It also looks at the Russian position with regard to the main nonproliferation issues of Iran and North Korea, what the implications of these positions are for the achievement of U.S. policy goals, and what the United States might do with regard to Russia to advance those goals in a dynamic international environment.
