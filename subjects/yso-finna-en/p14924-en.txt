Studying at a distance : a guide for students
During the recent years blended learning has become more common strategy in higher education. In Oulu University of Applied Sciences School of Business and Information Management blended learning was developed in a project where about 20 teachers from two degree programs developed courses from the point of view of individual, blended and online learning. A focus group interview was organised with voluntary students in order to get insights to student's experiences.     Students wish that they would have activities and feedback along the course - not big assignments or exam at the end of the course. Blended learning should be tied to real life cases which are connected to theories. Two-way interaction plays a critical role when blended learning is used in order to avoid the isolation of students. Learning Cafe type of assignments, where talented students' expertise could be used in coaching, received excellent feedback because of the better interaction.

Abstract : The purpose of this thesis was to improve the SAMK blended learning process as a whole by finding possible enhancements for the practicalities of distance learning in the BME programme.   The theoretical background related to continuous learning, knowledge sharing in virtual teams and technology based teaching & learning as well as the concept of blended learning are discussed as viewpoints to distance learning. Also examples of blended learning implementations in three different educational institutions are briefly presented.   The implementation of blended learning in Satakunta University of Applied Sciences is considered by looking at its elements, constructivism as the pedagogic approach and Jasu-Kuusisto & Mattila model as the implementation guide. The blended learning solutions in the BME programme are discussed as well.   In the inductive qualitative research the data was gathered by using a semi-structured e-interview. The answers to the e-interview questions were analyzed according to grounded theory and recursive abstraction methods. Based on the findings of the preliminary analysis an additional question was sent to the respondents of the e-interview. The answers to the additional question were analyzed using diligent interpretation in order to gain deeper understanding.   The analysis yielded six primary findings indicating common satisfaction in the functions of the library and the other supportive offices, mixed feelings about the contact sessions and discontent of absences and unreachability of programme participants in general. Another three related findings not in the scope of the e-interview were discovered and utilized in the research, typical for the process of an inductive research.   The findings combined with diligent interpretation of the answers were used as a basis for 16 recommendations regarding the blended learning implementation in the SAMK BME programme. While two of the recommendations suggest keeping the supportive offices and the use of email and Moodle as they are, the rest of the recommendations suggest changes in the existing practices, or implementation of completely new approaches. While some of the suggested changes can be implemented immediately with a single decision, others require planning of larger changes in the BME programme structure.   Despite the low answering percentage in the research, the study has reached its target of suggesting improvements in the overall model of blended learning in Satakunta University of Applied Sciences.
