This thesis aims at finding out what the important and meaningful communicational factors are in sales packages when a consumer is making buying decisions? The study concentrates in the stereo headsets sales packages. A sales package has been recognized to be a powerful way to communicate and contact the customer and it has become a significant tool for marketing communication. Growing amount of self-service based sales points has increased the sales package`s communicational value. The theory part contains an overview of packaging development discussing the phases in a typical sales package project as well as the description of objectives and decisions in different phases. Also the communicational elements of a sales package, such as package style, colors, images and package and brand are dealt with in general terms. The research part contains detailed evaluation of four different brands stereo headphones sales packages and findings from consumer interviews. Based on observations from interviews and evaluations of existing sales packages ideas how to develop and improve the sales package communication of stereo headphones are suggested to Nokia Accessories.
