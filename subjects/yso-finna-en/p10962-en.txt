"Delirium is a common clinical problem in critical care patients, with up to 80% of patients experiencing at least one episode during their time on a critical care unit. It is associated with significantly adverse outcomes for patients, including death and long-term cognitive impairment equivalent to at least a mild dementia. This clinical handbook explains why delirium goes unrecognised in most ICUs and describes simple tools the bedside clinician can use to detect it, even in the ventilated patient. It is in an easy-to-read format and illustrated with figures, case reports and patient testimony. This book contains all you need to know in order to prevent, diagnose and manage delirium in your patients. Delirium in Critical Care is essential reading for all members of the intensive care multidisciplinary team, including senior and junior physicians, and nurses"--Provided by publisher.
