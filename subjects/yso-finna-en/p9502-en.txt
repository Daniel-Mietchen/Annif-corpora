Edzard Ernst is the world's first professor of complementary medicine and Simon Singh is the author of several international bestsellers. Together they have written the definitive book on aletrnative medicine. It is honest, impartial, hard-hitting and provides a thorough examination and judgement of more than thirty of the most popular treatments, including: -acupuncture, -homeopathy, -aromatherapy, -reflexology, -chiropractic, -herbal medicine. Whether you are a follower, sceptic or just baffled by the subject, Trick or Treatment? delivers the ultimate verdict on alternative medicine with clarity, scientific rigour and absolute authority." -- (Back Cover)
