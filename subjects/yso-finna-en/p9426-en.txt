Wood has been a traditional construction material for centuries all over the world, as it still is in many places today. Now there is a growing interest in using wood in modern residential architecture. Architects today are drawn to it for a variety of reasons including its sustainability, versatility, economy, and natural beauty. As a result, this environmentally sustainable material is becoming increasingly significant in today's domestic architecture. Wood, intrinsically beautiful in all of its forms, can be used in practically any part of the construction from a heavy structural frame to finely detailed cabinetry, and from flooring to roof shingles. These volumes document wood used in different buildings and constructions. Each house profile is illustrated with the architect's own plans and elevations and also numerous full color interior and exterior photographs that highlight the natural appeal of wood.

INTERIOR DESIGN, DECOR & STYLE GUIDES. Life Unstyled is about taking inspiration from real homes that are beautiful, creative and inspiring but at the same time a little rough around the edges, with signs of everyday life evident throughout. The first section, 'Homes Unstyled', sets out Emily's manifesto for creating a stylish home that is beautiful but lived in. A Home is Never Done advocates allowing your space to evolve gradually so it is an ever-changing expression of your tastes and interests. Work with What You've Got suggests ways to make the most of the home you have rather than yearning for unattainable perfection. Signs of Life offers ideas for wrangling papers, clutter and other stuff. Creative Clutter tackles collections and displays, while Break the Rules rejects style diktats and shows how individuality can bring a home to life.

The commissioner of this thesis is a company called CubiCasa. The reason for this thesis was the interest of CubiCasa on 3 different segments. The segments were AR/VR, home decoration and real estate business. The commissioner wanted to find out if it is profitable for the company to go and target these different segments. On these segments they also defined 4 different companies: InsiteVR, Augmented Pixels, CoContest and Zillow. Of these companies they wanted more information and if they should go and sell their products to them. Most of the used material were from the internet sources. Theory part of this thesis were gathered from books. Most of the segments were found to not be profitable for CubiCasa to sell their products to at this time. The company operating in real estate business, Zillow, is the most relevant ones from these companies and segments because of the technology of CubiCasa and their production process. But even in the case of Zillow CubiCasa still have to wait until they have managed to create an almost fully automated production process on the floor plans.
