Someone is willing to kill a woman for helping couples have children - and Ellie must protect her. Perfect Child is a company specialised in medically assisted procreation - for extremely wealthy customers. An activity that isn't to everyone's taste, a fact that the CEO, Ava Troy, knows full well - she's received the treats to prove it. Enter Ellie Braxton, assigned as Ava's bodyguard. Unfortunately, Ellie isn't doing too well. Her teammate and mentor, Walt, is still in a coma, and she's having many doubts about her life choices. But can she really afford such a luxury?
