Sheet and film forming processes such as paper manufacturing pose a challenging monitoring and control problem, where quality variations are classified into machine direction (MD), cross-machine direction (CD) and residual variation. The measurements are typically collected with a scanning sensor that covers only a small part of the paper web, and therefore provides a very limited view of the paper web, setting performance limitations on the online monitoring and control.The development of cameras, light sources and computation hardware enable the consideration of utilizing in-use web inspection systems in paper machines to measure the paper web variations with a considerably higher resolution, sampling rate and coverage. The light transmittance images captured with this kind of system need, however, to be converted into a controllable quality property, such as basis weight, in order to utilize the new measurement information for control purposes.In this thesis, computational methods are identified and developed that are capable of combining light transmittance and scanning measurements, and can efficiently utilize the combined information for control purposes. The possible benefits gained with these image-based measurements in paper machine online monitoring and profile control are evaluated in a simulation environment. In a real paper machine, the benefits are ultimately dependent on the machine configuration and the nature of paper variations therein.It was found that with a suitable estimation method, light transmittance could increase the awareness of basis weight variations such as fast MD variation, tilted waves and dynamic CD variation patterns, which are practically undetectable using scanner-based measurement. The enhanced basis weight estimation enables a considerable improvement in the dynamic performance of profile controls. CD control was able to handlefast variations earlier classified as uncontrollable residual variation. In MD control, enhanced estimation enabled the development of a control strategy that led to improved reference tracking and disturbance rejection properties.
