Jaakko Olkinuora examines the Byzantine hymnography written for the feast of the Entrance of the Theotokos into the Temple, celebrated on November 21, from an intermedial perspective, connecting it to the relevant homiletic, musical, and iconographic material. The study demonstrates how these liturgical arts are inextricably connected in the context of worship, both in terms of content and presentation. The Byzantine conceptions of rhetoric and exegesis penetrate all phases of artistic creation, and their final purpose is to elevate believers to communion with God and His saints in eschatologically-oriented, "liturgical time." The analysis is based on both previously published and unpublished hymnographic texts. One of the major contributions of the Present volume is a modern edition and English translation of the unpublished hymns.
