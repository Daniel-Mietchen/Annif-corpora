This thesis is based on electric drives with various control parameters and how it's used in lifting/hoisting applications. However a series of tests were carried out in the laboratory to know the necessary operating parameters in electric drives used in lifting applications. An important task was to determine the actual operating frequency applied to each motors without failing the load, as well as the maximum allowable mass that each electric motors can lift without failure. Information has been collected working on an experimental crane in the Hamk Laboratory and making series of test with different loads and drive parameters like speeds, torques, output voltages, and output frequencies and so on. The motor type used in these applications was a three phase AC motor in which the driving torque is generated by the interaction of the sinusoidally distributed air gap flux and induced rotor currents. As a result a recommendation is given for parameters such as: Parameter 2001 “MINIMUM SPEED”, Parameter 2002 “MAXIMUM SPEED”, Parameter 2204 “RAMP SHAPE1”, Parameter 2202 “ACCELERATION TIME 1”, Parameter 1404 “RO 1 ON DELAY” used in lifting and hoisting applications.
