The main purpose of this study was to find out how much physiotherapy services are used by people with Parkinson's disease in the Satakunta District, and whether or not they feel that physiotherapy is beneficial in improving activities of daily living.  This study was intended to assist the Finnish Parkinson Association with their ongoing project to improve the rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease.    This research was a non-experimental descriptive quantitative survey, where data was collected by mailed questionnaires.  The methods used to acquire subjects were the convenience and systematic sampling methods.  The final subject group consisted of 48 people with Parkinson's disease.  This sample included 19 female and 29 male subjects, age group ranging from 53 to 80 years.    The results of this study revealed that people with Parkinson's disease do use physiotherapy services, however not to the fullest capacity.  The majority of subjects did not receive physiotherapy until a few years after their diagnosis, which does not correspond with the recommendations found in theory.  However subjects who have received physiotherapy treatment for Parkinson's disease seem to be pleased with the effects and consider it beneficial.  Physiotherapeutic treatment is desirable both by those who have and have not experienced it.    More research is needed in defining the reasons why physiotherapy is not used to the fullest advantage for people with Parkinson's disease, the specific types of physiotherapy they are offered, and if the benefits experienced are possible to measure.

"About one in every thousand babies born each year has clubfoot, a disorder that affects foot and calf muscles. Because treatment usually begins soon after birth and continues for several years, parents play a key role in the treatment of clubfoot and need to be able to communicate effectively with their child's doctor. The Parents' Guide to Clubfoot is the only book about clubfoot that is written for parents so they can learn everything they need to know about their child's condition. It is an all-in-one resource with medical information, advice from parents, comments from clubfoot experts, and even an illustrated story for preschoolers that parents can read aloud to their children. Written in everyday language, the book covers clubfoot in babies and older children from diagnosis through treatment for mild to severe cases. It provides details on clubfoot, its causes, treatment and care, along with an extensive list of resources and clubfoot assessment aids. In keeping with currently preferred treatments in the U.S., it emphasizes the Ponseti method, which minimizes surgery, and includes perspectives from Ponseti-trained clubfoot doctors and parents of children with clubfoot. However, separate chapters discuss all pre-treatment and post-treatment care options and one chapter covers surgery and post-surgery care if it becomes necessary"--

"Alleviation, rehabilitation and participation are the cornerstones not only of palliative care but also physiotherapy. Hence it is hardly surprising that physiotherapists are indisputable sources of strength to patients with life-limiting illnesses. This book is the first of its kind to paint a comprehensive picture of the concepts and vision of palliative physiotherapy from both an authoritative and empathetic perspective. From paediatrics to geriatrics, from the early stages of a disease to the terminal phase, international experts provide a structured guide to the wide-ranging possibilities that physiotherapy has to offer as part of end of life care. Comprehensive advice as well as practical tips can be found in case studies and personal accounts. Insight is provided to clinical and non-clinical aspects as well as appropriate contextual information, for example: common symptoms such as pain, breathlessness, oedema, fatigue, weakness, anxiety or dementia; medication, symptoms of cord compression and palliative care emergencies; special features of paediatric palliative care; communication with patients and their families; ethics, intercultural proficiency and spirituality; opportunities for therapist self-care. This is a book for all those (not only in hospices and palliative care units) faced with caring for critically ill and terminally ill patients - essential reading for a professional, considered approach." -- (takakansi)
