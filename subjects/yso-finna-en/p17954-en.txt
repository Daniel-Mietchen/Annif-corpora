The objective of the study was to gather information of China's real estate market and local consumer's buying behaviour linked with residential properties in Nanjing. The purpose is to help foreign investors to develop a better understanding of Chinese consumer and its real estate market. The findings will answer the research questions: what is the investment climate of China's real estate market like? And what are the characteristics of consumer's behaviour on purchasing residential properties in Nanjing, China? The theoretical framework is based on the combination of three theories which are PESTE, Five Forces Industry Analysis and Consumer's Buying Behaviour. PESTE analysis gives a general picture of investment climate related to real estate in China. Five forces industry analysis presents close and detailed information of the China's real estate industry. And Consumer's buying behaviour model focuses on the buying decision-making process of consumers, especially the criteria and factors that influence it. The research methodology used was mainly quantitative, primary data was collected by qualitative interviews and a questionnaire. 80 questionnaires were collected and analysed. Secondary data was mainly collected from books, internet web pages and research reports.     The findings show that China's investment climate is positive and China's real estate market has a great potential for development. Price, type, structure, design, location of housing are the main influences on potential buyer's decision making process. Foreign investors need to have suitable marketing strategy based on good knowledge of the current industry situation and major factors which can give great influences on consumer's buying behaviour, in order to cater to targeted buyer's needs and desires for residential properties.  The study suggests foreign investors to 'touch the stone while crossing rive'. It is important for foreign investors to know the trend of the market and understand Chinese consumers' needs and desires for their future residential properties. Investors need to bear in mind to build up and keep a good relationship with suppliers and Chinese authorities within the real estate industry. In addition, in order to enhance investors' competitiveness in terms of penetrating China's real estate market, to establish a good reputation and to have a continuously close monitoring action on the major player's performance are key issues.
