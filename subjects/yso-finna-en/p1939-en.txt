Children born with a cleft lip and or palate face numerous difficulties during the course of their lives. Their families must respond to the challenge of a high level of burden of care required by these patients. The studies listed in this thesis benchmark the characteristics of cleft lip and palate in a cohort of patients living in Northern Finland. These studies strived to consider epidemiologic aspects, speech results, palatal fistula rates and hearing outcome.Records of a total of 214 patients treated between 1998-2011 at the Oulu Cleft Lip and Palate Center were assessed on a retrospective basis. Cleft palate (68.7%) was most frequent followed by cleft lip and palate (18.7%) and cleft lip with or without alveolus (12.6%). Cleft palate occurred more frequently in females (63%) and cleft lip and palate was more frequent in males (62.5%) most commonly affecting the left side (82%).The overall frequency of speech operations following primary palatoplasty was 21%. This was significantly higher for girls (27%) than for boys (13%). Patients with cleft lip and palate were more likely to require speech improvement surgery (24%) than patients with isolated soft or soft and hard palate clefts (20%).The overall frequency of postoperative fistulas following primary palatoplasty was (9.6%). Patients with cleft lip and palate were more likely to develop postoperative palatal fistulas (20%) than patients with cleft palate (6.6%).The severity of the cleft, the surgical technique used to repair the palate, hearing outcome, and the need for ventilation tube placement were determined retrospectively. At least mild hearing loss was found in 3.3% of cleft patients. Neither the surgical technique used to repair the cleft palate nor the severity of the cleft were found to be significant factors related to hearing loss or to the number of ventilation tubes required. Hearing improved sig nificantly with increasing age over a span of 6 years.

For the purpose of the publication of the Proceedings, a special section was added which specifically deals with cross-cultural perspectives and international issues. .
Abstract.
The First Comprehensive Guide to Educational Interpreting As many as 22,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students are currently enrolled in local school programs where their access to the language of learning is dependent upon an interpreter. This book brings together comprehensive information about the practice of interpreting in educational settings. As the author points out, the field of educational interpreting has developed quickly in recent years, creating the need for this practical guide to serve as a resource for interpreters, general education teachers, special education teachers, special education directors, parents, speech-language pathologists, school administrators, and others concerned with the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The book takes a developmental approach to curriculum and instruction regarding students who use interpreters, moving from preschool on through the graduate school. The topics covered relate to the specific needs of learners at each age and apply to interpreters who use sign language, cued speech, and oral interpreting. Each section is presented in a question-answer format, with an emphasis on the challenges posed by interpreting in educational setting and the practices best suited to meeting those challenges. For each of the educational settings, engaging case studies focus on real-life situations and are followed by suggested best-practice solutions as well as questions for further thought.

This is an introductory text on mental health and deafness for care workers and mental health workers, both those familiar with deaf people but not with mental health and those familiar with mental health but not with deaf people. It covers a wide range of mental health issues as they relate to deafness and is divided into two sections. The first, Assessment, includes topics ranging from child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry, children who are deaf and have multiple disabilities, addictive behaviour and deafness, to maltreatment of deaf children. The second section, Management and Intervention, discusses interpreters in mental health settings, educational interventions, family therapy and drug treatments. The contributors to this book, some of who are deaf themselves, come from a range of professional disciplines and are international experts in their fields.

The cochlear implant debate has changed, as evidenced in this cogent collection that presents 13 chapters by 20 experts, including several who communicate through sign language but also utilize cochlear implants. The impetus for this change stems from recognition that both visual and aural input can enhance the education of deaf children. Divided into four sections, Cochlear Implants: Evolving Perspectives first focuses on the impact of implants in the Deaf community. Chapters in this section examine the issues driving the cochlear implant debate, the ethics of genetic engineering, experiences of implanted adult deaf signers, reflections of deaf mothers who have had their children implanted, and the effects of implants on deaf identity. The second section delves into the mechanics of bimodal processing, including listening strategies that can benefit signing children with cochlear implants. The third section surveys combined aural/visual educational approaches, such as teaching implanted children in an ASL/English bilingual classroom, and applying auditory rehabilitation to a signed communication context. The final section challenges readers to reframe the debate first by exploring sensory politics, then by envisioning an emerging world that requires the Deaf community to connect with it to secure its future. With this information, readers will reach their own conclusions about cochlear implants and auditory and visual approaches to the mastery of both spoken and signed languages.

"Many students struggle with the transition from high school to the next stage of their lives. For deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students, that struggle can be intensified by barriers and discriminatory attitudes they face in their communities, schools, and workplaces. Though much progress has been made, they are often underemployed and underpaid, and they receive postsecondary training at lower rates than other disability groups. Author Pamela Luft explores the reasons for these statistics and offers strategies and resources that can improve outcomes. Promoting Positive Transition Outcomes is the most comprehensive discussion of transition planning and results for DHH students now available. Luft begins with an overview of the historical and current challenges to DHH students and their academic and vocational potential. She explores the importance of forming an identity and building foundational social and problem-solving skills. She then reviews the history of rehabilitation and workforce legislation, which now mandates that every student with an individualized education plan (IEP) have a transition plan in place by the age of 16. Most schools, however, are not equipped to meet the needs of a population as diverse as DHH students. She examines the services that are currently available in high schools and offers recommendations for strengthening transition team planning by reaching out to external experts. The volume concludes with suggestions for creating a framework to address the challenges of transition planning for deaf and hard of hearing students and offers guidance on building effective plans"--

Thirty million people across all boundaries of life - friends, parents, grandparents and co-workers - face accepting an acquired hearing loss. An almost invisible disability, the effects of even a slight hearing loss can render experiences in the "hearing world" tenuous and fraught with barriers. Thoughtful and insightful, Dr. Michael Harvey, a clinical psychologist, gives us a glimpse into the lives of ten people; each a resonating example of feelings and circumstances - a hard-of-hearing teen struggling to find her place between two worlds, grown children trying to persuade their elderly mother to accept hearing aids. Propelled on an odyssey of frustration and isolation, change and growth, these people, through fascinating therapeutic dialogue, uncover ways to meet their challenges. Each story is an important and healing gift for people who love and cherish, offer professional care to, or are themselves people with hearing loss, and provides a compassionate look at the unique and the universal issues faced by anyone who has struggled with loss.

Ethics in mental health and deafness
One out of every eight people between the ages of 18 and 67 in the United States has a hearing loss, estimated as 12 percent of the working-age population. Sound Sense: Living and Learning with Hearing Loss addresses the acute need of these people to function at the highest level in these income-earning years, the longest phase in their lives. In nine pointed chapters, author Sara Laufer Batinovich, who also has lost her hearing, shares her experience and knowledge in turning every challenge into an opportunity to become ones best self-advocate. Batinovich begins in the workplace, advising on winning a job, keeping it, and developing a long-term career, plus how to reduce stress and establish fulfilling professional relationships with colleagues. She offers tips on communication ranging from having sales people face you for easier speechreading to parsing boarding announcements at airports and play-by-play at ballparks. Her practical handbook also provides step-by-step guidance for getting a hearing aid or a cochlear implant and finding ones way through prickly insurance claim mazes. Sound Sense features information on finding a service dog, securing legally mandated accommodations for continuing education, tips on exercise and health, and even sensitive suggestions on strengthening personal relationships. Batinovichs vivacious style and her own anecdotes add an upbeat, genuine sensibility to her books value as a positive guide to living with hearing loss.
