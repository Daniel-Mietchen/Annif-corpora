Often, amateur sport teams try to find an inexpensive way on how they can effectively track and manage their team. FC Tigers football team is one of them. This team has about 30  players working in the same company. The managers of this team needed a practical system to help them keeping track of players available for playing a football game every Thursday evening. The objective of this thesis consists of two parts: the practical part and the theoretical part. The practical part focuses on building a Football Team Tracker (FTT) System which is a Web Application implemented using Ruby on Rails language and Agile Development Methodology. This application aims mainly to solve the problems with managing a football team. The theoretical part focuses on testing the Feature Driven Development (FDD) Agile methodology  against what it has been said about its benefits such as detecting bugs earlier, aims  for minimizing documentation, saves you time, iterative approach and so on. The FTT application provides the basic and the most important features. Due to the lack of time the nice-to-have features and usability are left for the other developers who would like to enhance this system in the future. However, open sourcing this web application and the way this application is designed provide high scalability. So, it can be re-used for any kind of sport which requires a team commitment. One can change the banner's text of this web application and he is ready to go. As a result for the theoretical part of this project, it has been found that the features of the FDD method tested reflect, nevertheless, what has been said about its benefits. It also fits well within a small Rails project with even two developers.
