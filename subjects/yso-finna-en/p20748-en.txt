Development research for Cramo Plc annual report to meet the requirements of IR communications
The main objective of the research is to attain feedback on the 2009 Annual Report from selected stakeholders that could help to develop the annual report of the commissioning company, Cramo Plc, for the year 2011. Other objectives are to find out what status the annual report has among the sample and how it is used. The author worked at Cramo Plc as assistant trainee during the research process. The annual report is a key communication tool of a public limited company; it is designed for the company's main stakeholders, the shareholders. The annual report is an important part of a company's investor relations communication. A public limited company should develop its IR communication into a dialogue, which allows the stakeholders to give feedback. Constructive feedback is important for improving the main IR communication tool, i.e. the annual report. The chosen research method is qualitative interviewing. The selected sample contains representatives of stakeholders who have contact with Cramo Plc. The semi-structured interviews followed the themes of the annual report and offered the possibility to adjust the interviews to more closely reflect the interviewees' interests. Companies that specialize in evaluating and producing annual reports, along with organisations that organise annual report and IR communication competitions, were studied to attain background information regarding the elements that contribute to good annual reports. The interviews were conducted during the summer of 2010; they were conducted in Finnish, and then translated in English for the group reporting. The results show that readability of the Cramo Plc Annual Report 2009 was considered “good” and the overall averages given were “above good.” The main development required is better control of the amount of information. The sample interviews indicated that although the report offers much good information, some of the selected interviewees would appreciate a more simple presentation.
"With contributions from leading scholars in the field, Rebels in Groups brings together the latest research on dissent, deviance, difference and defiance. Many of the most famous figures in psychology - Asch, Milgram and Zimbardo and others - have emphasized the pressures to conform and obey which are present in groups, and focused on the positive value that groups place on loyalty and uniformity. From this perspective, dissent, deviance, difference and defiance have been regarded as detrimental forces within groups: reflections of a lack of group loyalty, a sign of disengagement or delinquent behaviour. Contrary to traditional views, this book presents an approach which considers rebellion to be a normal, functional and healthy aspect of group life. Rebels in Groups presents the latest thinking on these issues by examining a broad range of groups - such as political groups, task groups, and teams in organisations - and by considering diverse fields of psychology, including social, organizational, and developmental psychology. In the process, it shows how new approaches to the study of dissent, deviance, difference and defiance have refined our theorizing in this area and shed a more nuanced light upon the role of rebels in groups"--

Integrative group therapy : mobilizing coping abilities with the five-stage group
"Through using spoken language, people are able to think creatively and productively together. This ability to 'interthink' is an important product of our evolutionary history that is just as important for our survival today. Many kinds of work activity depend on the success of groups or teams finding joint solutions to problems. Creative achievement is rarely the product of solitary endeavour, but of people working within a collective enterprise. Written in an accessible and jargon-free style, Interthinking: putting talk to work explores the growing body of work on how people think creatively and productively together. Challenging purely individualistic accounts of human evolution and cognition, its internationally acclaimed authors provide analyses of real-life examples of collective thinking in everyday settings including workplaces, schools, rehearsal spaces and online environments. The authors use socio-cultural psychology to explain the processes involved in interthinking, to explore its creative power, but also to understand why collective thinking isn't always productive or successful. With this knowledge we can maximise the constructive benefits of our ability to interthink, and understand the best ways in which we can help young people to develop, nurture and value that capability. This book will be of great interest to academic researchers, postgraduates and undergraduates on Education and Psychology courses and to practicing teachers. It will also appeal to anyone with an interest in language, creativity and the role of psychology in everyday life"--
