Nordea IT provides information technology services internally to different business units in Nordea. These services are development and maintenance services and production services. IT is non-profit unit, and thus the total external cost is allocated to internal business units according to the agreed principles. Service Catalogue for IT services has been defined to support the dialogue related IT services the between IT and business units. Services are priced using the Activity Based Calculation model and according to the Financial Control Principles in Nordea. There are Nordea-level planning processes which are used for ordering and allocating of services. IT's pricing and allocation processes are aligned to those processes. The current processes in IT are evaluated and the need for improvement is identified. The goal for the thesis is to describe the improvement proposals in order to increase in efficiency in IT and increase the transparency in the cost management. Improvement proposals are suggested on the planning processes on which IT is dependent. The purpose is to look into the whole value chain and propose the improvements in different parts of the value chain. Part of the improvement proposals are short term activities which can be implemented within one year. The other part of the proposals is long term activities and thus can be implemented within one to three years.
