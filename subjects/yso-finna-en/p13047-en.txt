India : west coast : Gulf of Cutch to Viziadrig from surveys by the officers of the East India government 1828-1856
A General Chart of the Baltic or East Sea, including the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland : compiled from the Surveys
When the first edition of this book was published in 2009, the mandatory carriage of ECDIS had been agreed at IMO but implementation seemed a long way off. On 1 July 2012 a comprehensive rolling phase-in schedule began and this second edition recognises that practical guidance on equipment, training and operational practices is now needed urgently. Everything you need to understand in order to manage this fundamental change from navigating by paper charts to navigating by ECDIS is covered. This theoretical knowledge is made real through contributions from sea-going members of The Nautical Institute who have been using electronic charts for some time. Unsurprisingly, many of these contributions relate to training. Best practice is encapsulated in the industry recommendations for ECDIS training and familiarisation (including a familiarisation checklist), drawn up by a group coordinated by the Institute, which are included as appendices.

When the first edition of this book was published in The objective of this book is to impart practical hands-on knowledge about ECDIS. For less-experienced users, the book will help them to gain a valuable overview of the principles of ECDIS navigation and the related challenges. Meanwhile, it is likely that advanced ECDIS operators will also be able to find new answers and helpful suggestions. Based upon the principles of the IMO Model Course 1.27, the book is suitable for all kinds of ECDIS courses in different settings.

Part 10 of the Utrecht Studies of the History of Cartography (EXPLOKART). The Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company) was for a period of 200 years responsible for the navigation material for the journey between the Netherlands and the Far East and the inter-Asian trade. In this book with the help of recovered archive materials a never published before overview is given of chart material that was used on a VOC-ship. All navigation charts of the VOC in the 17th and 18th century, drawn on vellum (of which many were traced in foreign collections), are described and analysed in an illustrated cartobibliography. In a supplement extracts of the |groot-journalen| of the |Kamer Amsterdam| are published. These give an unique view of the total expenses of the VOC on navigation. The extensive introduction gives more information on the history of the VOC, the chart makers, the routes, the navigation and the instruments.
