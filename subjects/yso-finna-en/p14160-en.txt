"The 'Conversation Piece' is an intriguing contradiction - the high-life group, but caught informally, off-guard. Popular in seventeenth-century Dutch painting, it developed to include sporting events and 'Grand Tourists', and reached its apogee in the eighteenth century in the masterpieces created by Johan Zoffany for his English patrons, including George III." "This new publication accompanies the first exhibition on this subject for over thirty years, presenting early Dutch and Flemish genre paintings against their successors in the informal portraiture of Stubbs and Hogarth, as well as iconic works by Zoffany himself. It also provides a unique opportunity to connect the study of the 'conversation' in eighteenth- century English art to its seventeenth-century European predecessors."--

"Preface We know what you are asking yourself. There are a lot of books available in image processing so what is novel in this book?' We can summarize the answer with the following points 1. This book is devoted to the issue of obtaining high-resolution images from single or multiple low-resolution images. 2. You always see different algorithms for image interpolation and super-resolution without a common thread between the two processes. This book presents interpolation as a building block in the super-resolution reconstruction process. 3. You see research papers on image interpolation either as a polynomial-based problem or an inverse problem without a comparison of the two trends. This book presents this comparison. 4. Two chapters are devoted to two complementary steps that are used to obtain high-resolution images. These steps are image registration and image fusion. 5. This book presents two directions for image super-resolution; super-resolution with a priori information and blind super-resolution. 6. This book presents applications for image interpolation and super-resolution in medical and satellite image processing. 7. MATLABʼ codes for most of the simulation experiments discussed in this book are included in Appendix D at the end of the book. Finally, we hope that this book will be helpful for the image processing community. MATLABʼ is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.
