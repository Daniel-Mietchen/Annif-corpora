"Shamans attract controversy and fascination well beyond their numbers. Personal experiences with shamans are based here on extensive fieldwork in several areas of Siberia and the Far East, including Khanty, Sakha, Tuvan and Buriat regions. The author outlines shifting ways that healers and healing communities are creating effective yet altered ritual environments, transcending harsh legacies of Soviet and missionary repression. Providing new angles on our understanding of the intersections of spirituality, religion and politics, she uses narratives about shamans to probe social and political issues of post-socialism, modernity, authenticity and indigenous rights. She argues that talented contemporary shamans and shamanic trickster-artists combine social leadership, charisma, creative talent, ecological sensitivity and healing gifts in their activist lives"-- Provided by publisher.

This text explains why beliefs in supernatural forces - ghosts, poltergeists, witches, and spirits - are based on universal experience. The author maintains that beliefs in mysterious anomalies such as estatic trances, apparitions, extra-sensory perceptions, out-of-body experiences, psychokinesis, firewalking, and miraculous recovery are predicated upon evolutionary psychology. Such beliefs reveal a spiritual impulse in the human species. He aims to demonstrate that age-old healing rituals such as chanting and rythmic dancing have scientically verifiable benefits.
