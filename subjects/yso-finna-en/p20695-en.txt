This book presents a detailed description of the archaeological evidence for the five Military Orders active in the Latin East: the Hospitallers; Templars; Teutonic Knights; Leper Knights of St Lazarus; and Knights of St Thomas. During the 12th and 13th centuries these Military Orders played an active role in the defence of the Latin States in the East (modern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus) and administered various urban and rural properties. They were also significantly involved in activities relating to the welfare of the Frankish populace and of the pilgrims visiting the Holy Land. The book concentrates on the urban quarters of the Orders, their rural castles, their architecture, and the role they played in shaping military architecture in the Middle Ages.
