Texts concerning culture at European Community level
"What was "Creative Britain"? Was it the "golden age" that Tony Blair vaunted in 2007, or a neoliberal nirvana? In the twenty-first century, culture--the visual and performing arts, museums and galleries, the creative industries--have become ever more important to governments, to the economy, and to how people live. Cultural historian Robert Hewison shows how, from Cool Britannia and the Millennium Dome to the Olympics and beyond, Creative Britain rose from the desert of Thatcherism only to fall into the slough of New Labour's managerialism"--

"Imperial tombs, Buddhist architecture, palaces, and art treasures in Korea and Japan have attracted scholars, collectors, and conservators--and millions of tourists. As iconic markers of racial and cultural identity at home and abroad, they are embraced as tangible sources of immense national pride and popular "must-see" destinations.This book provides the first sustained account to highlight how the forces of modernity, nationalism, colonialism, and globalization have contributed to the birth of museums, field disciplines, tourist industries, and heritage management policies. Its chapters trace the history of explorations, preservations, and reconstructions of archaeological monuments from an interregional East Asian comparative perspective in the past century.Hyung Il Pai is professor of East Asian languages and cultural studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is the author of Constructing Korean Origins."Any scholar interested in the politics of culture in imperial Japan or colonial Korea will want this book on his or her shelf." --Robert Oppenheim, University of Texas at Austin"--
