Abstract: Two observations of birds nestin in snow are reported. In northern finland a Capercaillie, Tetrao urogallus, and in western Finland an Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo, laid their eggs in the snow. All nine eggs laid by the Capercaillie hatched. The melting of the snow destroyed the Eagle Owls nest...

Abstract: In 1969, one, and in 1974, six nests of the Great Grey Owl, Strix nebulosa, were found in the central and southern parts of Salla, NE Finnish Forest Lapland. In 1974, pellets were collected at four nests and 504 hours of observation were carried out at one nest...

Breeding ecology of the horned grebe Podiceps auritus in subarctic wetlands
Abstract: The aggressiveness of the arctic tern towards nest predators was experimentally investigated by locating stuffed gulls in the vicinity of nests or chicks of terns. The frequencies of attacks were measured by counting the numbers os swoops on the dummy during ten-minute or sixteen-minute periods after the first swoop had been performed...
