In March 2008, the university library in Tromsø celebrated the opening of what they referred to as an 'indigenous room'. A collection of Sami literature was moved from its previous geographical and cultural context to what is today considered the more relevant company of American Indians, Australian aborigines and African peoples. Indicative of the increasing institutionalisation of the Sami as an indigenous people, the debate over what it means to be 'indigenous' is today important to Sami research, political strategies, cultural activities and religious creativity. In an attempt to take such innovations seriously, the article discusses some of the religious dimensions of Sami nation-building resulting from the ongoing processes of indigenisation. More specifically, I deal with a project structured by the international grammar of nation-building, which shares in the qualities of a civil religion and is at the same time shaped by 'indigenous spirituality'. Although a fairly recent construct, what I refer to as 'indigenous spirituality' is nevertheless a significant global discourse, developed primarily through the UN and international law. According to this perspective, indigenous peoples are the children of Mother Earth, and as such are opposed to and differentiated from the religions and worldviews of the 'western' world. Keywords: Sami, nation-building, indigenous, nature spirituality, Mother Earth .

The Second Edition of this classic work, first published in 1981 and an international bestseller, explores the differences in thinking and social action that exist among members of more than 50 modern nations. Geert Hofstede argues that people carry "mental programs" which are developed in the family in early childhood and reinforced in schools and organizations, and that these programs contain components of national culture. They are expressed most clearly in the different values that predominate among people from different countries. Geert Hofstede has completely rewritten, revised and updated Cultures Consequences for the twenty-first century, he has broadened the book's cross-disciplinary appeal, expanded the coverage of countries examined from 40 to more than 50, reformulated his arguments and a large amount of new literature has been included. The book is structured around five major dimensions: power distance; uncertainty avoidance; individualism versus collectivism; masculinity versus femininity; and long term versus short-term orientation. --Publisher.

English ethnicity and race in early modern drama
This new edition of Edward A. Allworth's The Tatars of Crimea has been extensively updated. Five new chapters examine the situation of Crimean Tatars since the breakup of the USSR in 1991 and detail the continuing struggle of the Tatars to find peace and acceptance in a homeland. Contributors to this volume—almost half of whom are Tatars—discuss the problematic results of the partial Tatar return to Crimea that began in the 1980s. This incomplete migration has left the group geographically split and has complicated their desire for stability as a people, whether in their own homeland or in the Central Asian diaspora. Those who have returned to the region on the Black Sea in Ukrayina (formerly Ukraine) have found themselves engulfed in a hostile political environment dominated by Russian residents attempting to stifle the resurgence of Crimean Tatar life. Specific essays address the current political situation in and around Crimea, recent elections, and promising developments in the culture, leadership, and movement toward unity among Crimean Tatars. Beyond demonstrating the problems of one nationality caught in a fierce power struggle, The Tatars of Crimea offers an example of the challenges faced by all nationalities of the former Soviet Union who now contend with deteriorating economic and political conditions, flagrant discrimination against ethnic minorities, and the denial of civil and human rights common in many of the newly independent states.

The South Asian diaspora came into being with the end of slavery in the British Empire. Huge numbers of labourers were recruited in the Indian sub-continent for indentured labour schemes, notably in Southeast Asia, South and East Africa, Mauritius, Fiji and the Caribbean, and also in French colonies. Later there were waves of 'free' immigration to these and other countries, including, in the last generation, Britain itself and North America.

The terms 'Woman' and 'Women' have been the organizing concepts for feminist politics and scholarship on women in western countries for several centuries. 'Women', it was assumed, shared characteristics based on biology and experiences of subordination; other aspects of their lives, such as language, national or ethnic identity, 'race', or sexual orientation were considered secondary to the identity of woman-ness. In this work, Dhruvarajan and Vickers call into question feminism's presumed universality of gender analysis, and bring to the foreground the voices of marginalized women in Western society, and of women outside of the western world. Gender, Race, and Nation discusses opening scholarship to the experiences of women in all of their diversity, making links between the differences in local contexts and global contexts, and relating to other women with the understanding of each woman's relative position in terms of power and privilege to facilitate coalition building and develop strategies to address issues of common concern to usher in a just and caring world for all. This change in perspective presented by Dhruvarajan and Vickers represents a paradigm shift in the study of women and women's issues, and forges a new approach to women's studies/scholarship on women, women' s movements, and global social transformation.

"This volume is devoted to the relationship between political and social dimensions of nation-building in Estonia. The authors of the volume analyse the Estonian nation-building since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and Estonia regained independence, in the context of post-communist transformation and globalization. Such a double macro-historical change has brought about highly polarized views in society between the ethnic Estonian and Russian-speaking communities on a number of key aspects of nation-building, like ethnic policy, meaning of national integration, etc. The volume argues that national integration can progress only via formation of a unifying citizen identity in Estonia, embedded within democratic political processes"--Publisher's description, back cover.
