Understanding operating instructions : a study of the language from a psycholinguistic point of view
The purpose of this study was to determine if differences existed when dysarthric speech was evaluated using three measures, intelligibility, comprehensibility and acceptability using younger and older typical adults as listeners. Intelligibility, an objective measure, was defined as percent of words heard correctly, comprehensibility, also an objective measure, as the ability to understand what is being said, and acceptability, a subjective measure, as how the listener rates the person's overall speaking ability. Four young adult males with traumatic brain injury and one control were recorded reading sentences from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS). Sentences were played back to younger and older listeners who provided all ratings. All ratings by both groups were high for intelligibility and comprehensibility. Ratings for acceptability indicated a group difference with older listeners rating acceptability similar to intelligibility and comprehensibility, while younger listeners rated acceptability at significantly lower levels compared to the other to measures. Results suggest that counseling may be necessary for younger TBI patients and their families to overcome possible peer rejection despite the fact that the patients actually produce highly intelligible and understandable speech.

Naive semantics for natural language understanding
"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

"Investigating English Pronunciation: Trends and Directions is a cutting-edge update on the latest research in the field of English pronunciation. The volume provides readers with fully-developed examples of the latest trends and research topics in English pronunciation from specialists in Europe, Asia, and the United States. These include, amongst others, segmental and suprasegmental features in L1 and L2 varieties of English, sociophonetic or sound-symbolic aspects of pronunciation, and applications such as English pronunciation teaching and learning. The contributions to the volume deal with original topics and make use of a wide variety of methods in researching English pronunciation, illustrating these through a series of selected case studies, and providing readers with a number of novel and motivating questions that will inspire further research"--

On sentence comprehension
Within the study of language and social interaction, the concept of 'accountability'-including related concepts, such as 'account' or 'motive,' 'accounting,' and 'being accountable'-has been of longstanding interest in terms of how interactants in both ordinary and organizational contexts manage their image or reputation, as well as how they achieve mutual understanding. However, these concepts are polysemous, with different senses being rather dramatic, such as accountability as 'moral responsibility' and accountability as 'intelligibility.' Even today this fact is not always remembered or fully recognized or appreciated by scholars, which has arguably slowed the development of these concepts. This volume brings together a collection of novel, conversation-analytic studies addressing accountability, with the goal of re-exposing its multiple senses, reiterating their interrelationships and, in doing so, breaking new conceptual ground and exposing new pathways for future research. The collection considers central theoretical issues, including turn taking, sequence and preference organization, repair, membership categorization, action formation and ascription, social solidarity and affiliation, and the relevance of context. Chapters range contextually, canvasing interactions between friends and family members, and during talk shows, broadcast news interviews, airline reservations, and medical visits. Chapters also range culturally, including English, Japanese, and Korean data.
