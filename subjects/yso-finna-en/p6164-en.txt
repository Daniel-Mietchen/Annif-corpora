Return migration in Central Europe : transnational migrants' perspectives and local businesses ́ needs
Many African migrants residing abroad nurture a hope to one day return, at least temporarily, to their home country. In the wake of economic crises in the developed world, alongside rapid economic growth in parts of Africa, the impetus to 'return' is likely to increase. Such returnees are often portrayed as agents of development, bringing with them capital, knowledge and skills as well as connections and experience gained abroad. Yet, the reality is altogether more complex. In this much-needed volume, based on extensive original fieldwork, the authors reveal that there is all too often a gaping divide between abstract policy assumptions and migrants' actual practices. In contrast to the prevailing optimism of policies on migration and development, Africa's Return Migrants demonstrates that the capital obtained abroad is not always advantageous and that it can even hamper successful entrepreneurship and other forms of economic, political and social engagement.

"Over the past thirty years, at the same time as Japan has produced a diverse set of youth cultures - such as anime and manga - which have had a major impact on popular culture across the globe, it has also developed a succession of youth problems which have led to major concerns within the country itself. Drawing on detailed empirical fieldwork, the authors set these issues in a clearly articulated 'social constructionist' framework, and put forth a sociology of Japanese youth problems which argues that the Japanese media draw on an equally, if not more, perplexing gallery of social categories when it discusses youth than affluent Western societies such as the US or UK. Moreover, the book contends that Japan is no less replete with social problems involving young people and no less capable of generating hysteria over the fate of its youth. The chapters include case studies covering issues such as: Returnee children, Compensated dating, Corporeal punishment, Child abuse, The withdrawn youth, NEET (not in education, employment or training). By examining these various social problems collectively, A sociology of Japanese youth shows how seemingly disparate events follow a similar pattern and how clusters of concepts are historically linked."--Publisher's description.

While other research has been completed on ethnic return migration to Finland, particularly on Ingrian Finns, very little attention has been paid to the remigration of ethnic Finns born and raised abroad in Western countries, such as the United States, Canada, and other European states. This article takes an exploratory approach and seeks to shed light on why people with Finnish roots born and raised in other Western countries seek to (re)migrate, as well as what they hope and expect of life in Finland. Results from focus group data collected at a Finnish language and culture course suggest that these individuals view their ethnic homeland very positively prior to migration, and consider the (re)migration process as natural or inevitable as a result of having Finnish roots. Participants expected to adapt to life in Finland with ease and discussed the benefits of having Finnish roots as a newcomer in the country..
