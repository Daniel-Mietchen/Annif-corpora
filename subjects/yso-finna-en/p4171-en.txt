"This new survey text for comparative religion, authored and edited by Lawrence Sullivan, successfully marries traditional approaches with analysis drawn from anthropology and sociology to explain the making of meaning in leading religious traditions. Sacred space, ritual performance, sacred texts, historical overviews and phenomenological insights are all examined in this full-color text to show the rich diversity of religious belief and practice. Distinctive in this volume are separate chapters on the diversity of Christianity across the globe. Features include numerous photographs of art and artifacts, maps, timelines, tables, textboxes, pedagogy, and a glossary."--Publisher description.

Sacred space, ritual performance, and sacred texts figure significantly in each religious traditions portrait, along with historical overviews and phenomenological insights and a focus on diverse groups or sects within each tradition. Unlike other texts, Christianity is broken out among its major divisions (early/primitive, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant). Features include a full-color interior, numerous photographs of art and artifacts, maps, timelines, tables, textboxes, pedagogy (outlines, questionsend of chapter and possibly integrated into the text, key terms, reading lists), and a glossary.

Historical dictionary of Jainism
It is impossible to speak of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam without using words from the original Sanskrit, Pali or Arabic. Few people will have had the opportunity of studying these languages for themselves, but they will need to understand technical words and to recognize the significance of important names as they occur. The author has provided definitions and descriptions of the most important words in six world religions together with introductions for each section which give additional information and interpretation.
John Cort explores the narratives by which the Jains have explained the presence of icons of Jinas (their enlightened and liberated teachers) that are worshiped and venerated in the hundreds of thousands of Jain temples throughout India.
