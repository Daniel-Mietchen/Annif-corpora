The Skylark
Designer Animals uses non-technical language to explore the science behind animal biotechnology and the ethical frameworks at play in its surrounding debates. By investigating the interests of major stakeholders, including researchers on the cutting edge of science; mainstream and 'alternative' agriculture organizations; the animal welfare movement; and health care providers, patients, and researchers, the contributors illuminate the most important points of agreement and disagreement on this hotly contested topic."--pub. desc.
Saving the planet with pesticides and plastics : the environmental triumph of high-yield farming
"Eating Animals" is a riveting expose which presents the gut-wrenching truth about the price paid by the environment, the government, the Third World and the animals themselves in order to put meat on our tables more quickly and conveniently than ever before. Interweaving a variety of monologues and balancing humour and suspense with informed rationalism, "Eating Animals" is as much a novelistic account of an intellectual journey as it is a fresh and open look at the ethical debate around meat-eating. Unlike most other books on the subject, "Eating Animals" also explores the possibilities for those who do eat meat to do so more responsibly, making this an important book not just for vegetarians, but for anyone who is concerned about the ramifications and significance of their chosen lifestyle.
