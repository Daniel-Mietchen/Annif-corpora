Brickstamps of Constantinople provides archaeologists and historians with the first major catalogue and analysis of stamped bricks manufactured in Constantinople and its vicinity in the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. The catalogue assembles not only all previously published stamps but also a large amount of unpublished material in archives and museum collections. Most of the variant stamps are illustrated with a sketch, drawing or photograph. The text discusses the organization of the brickmaking industry and the purpose of brickstamping, and establishes for the first time a chronological framework for the material. On the basis of the conclusions, dates are proposed for previously undated structures in the city, and revised dates are given for other monuments.

Published to accompany the first exhibition on ceramics of the Middle Ages anywhere for more than 50 years, this beautiful publication aims to demystify medieval art by highlighting the beauty and familiarity of ceramic pots and tiles from all over northern Europe, with an emphasis on 13th to early 16th-century England. Among the highlights presented here are three magnificent examples of the English jug, described in 1948 by the great historian of ceramics W.B. Honey in his Foreword to Bernard Rackham's pioneering book Medieval English Pottery, "quite simply, as the most beautiful pottery ever made in England." Formerly despised for their roughness and lack of superficial refinement, they are now recognized as worthy of comparison for their nobility of form with the early Chinese wares, so much admired today as the finest of all pottery. The Dartford Knight Jug is an example of the most celebrated of all medieval English pottery, dating to the late 13th century and made in Scarborough in Yorkshire. The Rye "Royal Presentation" Jug, excavated from a kiln site in Rye in the 1930s, having laid there since its creation in the 14th century is a remarkable survival decorated in a curious scene of finely scratched sgraffito figures. And a massive shouldered jug from Kedleston Hall was described when it was discovered in 1862 as "probably the most important and interesting early mediaeval relic of Norman pottery which has ever been exhumed".

Expert system for the evaluation of the deterioration of ancient brick masonry structures : Damage atlas : classification and analyses of damage patterns found in brick masonry
This work presents an archaeometric study on the Vindonissa stamped tiles. Vindonissa (Canton of Aargau, Switzerland) was an important Roman camp during the 1st century AD. With Vindonissa stamped tiles, archaeologists refer to all tiles stamped with the name of the military units that were stationed at Vindonissa from 47 to 101 AD. These tiles are among the most common archaeological findings in the Vindonissa legionary camp, but commonly occur in different Roman sites of Switzerland. The principal aim of this study was the petrographic and chemical characterisation of the Vindonissa tiles to determine the production site (or sites) for these ceramics and to obtain information concerning the technological aspects of the tile production and the distribution of these stamped tiles in Switzerland in Roman times.

"This study of the design, manufacture and use of medieval floor tiles shows the long-lasting influence achieved in the north of England by the monasteries of the reformed movement, particularly the Cistercians. It serves to demonstrate how these monastic houses made use of the resources and contacts available to them." "Over 500 different designs and 60 mosaic arrangements that had been in use in the medieval period were identified from the extant tiles and from searches of published literature and antiquarian records. The study examines changes in the design, production and use of a particular artefact type, in a large region, over a long period of time."--BOOK JACKET.

The purpose of this work is to determine the most informative articles and the most effective methods and research approaches to the study of Roman brick stamps covering the former Roman Empire. The different research methods used in different areas are compared. This study attempts to give an overall view of research methods, approaches and categories of studies used in all schools of brick stamp research and poses the question whether brick stamps can contribute to our understanding of military history. Regional and local differences of both stamps and modern schools of research are highlighted and their importance in terms of Roman history is discussed.

Brickstamps of Constantinople
This totally original architecture book, the first ever comprehensive study of brick, follows the story of brick from 5,000 bc to its use in building today, via the vast baths and basilicas of ancient Rome, through the wonders of Gothic brick in Germany, the majestic temples of Pagan and Mughal mosques in Iran, to its modern revival. Marvellously illustrated with spectacular, specially taken photographs, Brick is at once an historical account of how bricks have been employed by architects of every period, a technical survey of brickmaking and bricklaying, and an essay in architectural and cultural history. The authors have applied their expert visual and technical knowledge to more than one hundred themes, from bricks in ancient Egypt to their distinctive use by such modern masters as Louis Kahn, Alvar Aalto and Renzo Piano. Great works of engineering, viaducts, tunnels and bridges are given prominence alongside great cathedrals and country houses, temples and mosques, testifying to the incredible versatility and importance of bricks and brickwork
