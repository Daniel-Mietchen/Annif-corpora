Pilates' body conditioning : a program based on the techniques of Joseph Pilates
Artistic. athletic. attainable: these three words represent the promise of Ballet Beautiful, a transformative approach to reshaping your body so that it becomes slender, long, and lean--with the strength and grace of a ballerina. Founder Mary Helen Bowers has used this method to help women lose weight, turn fat into lean muscle, and re-contour their bodies to achieve the regal posture, strength, and elegance of a ballerina. Helps you: achieve the long, toned, and powerful body shape of a dancer; target trouble areas, such as legs, butt, and belly; get a dancer's beautiful posture and elegance. Includes healthy recipes and balanced, satisfying meal plans.
