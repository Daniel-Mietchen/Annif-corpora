Fatherhood in the Nordic welfare states : comparing care policies and practice
The Nordic countries are known worldwide for their extensive welfare system and gender equality, which enables both parents to hold jobs, earn money, and care for their children. In this volume, scholars from the Nordic countries, as well as from the United States and the UK, explore the effects of these policies on fatherhood, and how the policies that support it contribute to shaping and influencing the image, role, and practice of fathers in a diversity of family settings.

Comparing global experiences of childhood, this book examines children as social actors and citizens. Looking at theories around the social construction of childhood and substantive examples of the active contributions of children to society, this is an essential introduction to how the social sciences conceptualise childhood. Historically, children were often understood in relation to their development towards adulthood, but the 'new paradigm' of childhood studies has since shown how they should be taken more seriously as active participants in their own lives. Studying childhood is not just a question of research on children, but increasingly a practice of research with them. With this 'new paradigm' having now come of age, Sally McNamee offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of childhood studies and its history. Taking a thematic approach, she looks at how issues such as rights and citizenship, the state, the family, school, work, leisure, health and globalisation shape and are shaped by children. The Social Study of Childhood is an accessible introduction for students from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds such as childhood studies, sociology, psychology, social work and education. With reflection points for discussion and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter, it is an engaging and stimulating account of how and why children's voices deserve to be heard in today's world.
