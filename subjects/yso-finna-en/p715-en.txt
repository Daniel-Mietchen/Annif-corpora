Ex-nuns : a study of emergent role passage
Barbara Soros draws on the ancient wisdom of the Tibetan people to narrate the touching story of a young boy named Tenzin and the wounded musk deer he encounters in the woods. By paying heed to his dreams and to the needs of the animal he has rescued, Tenzin is able to cure the deer. But soon he discovers that he must learn one of the most important lessons of all: how to love deeply enough to let go. The lush, intricate illustrations evoke the emotional depth of this tale that encourages the Buddhist virtues of nonviolence, compassion and the rejection of materialism. / WorldCat.

Searching for heaven in the real world : a sociological discussion of conversion in the Arab world
While adjusting to a new identity is akin to adjusting to a new set of skin, even more difficult is realising that this new skin may not be as comfortable or as pleasant as the old one. In Searching for Heaven in the Real World, Kathryn Kraft explores the breadth of psychological and societal issues faced by Arab Muslims after making a decision to adopt a faith in Christ or Christianity, investigating some of the most surprising and significant challenges new believers face. Arab Muslims arrive at a point of new faith with great expectations. With such high hopes for what they will experience in their new identity, they are bound to encounter a reality that is different. They need to invest a great deal of emotional energy in addressing their expectations and what they actually encounter. Even so, those who stay the course of faith usually hold on to their dreams, believing that heaven is not only for the afterlife but it is for the real world as well.
