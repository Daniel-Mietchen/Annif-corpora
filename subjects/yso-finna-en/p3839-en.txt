The Marine Research Institute (MRI) has annually gathered information on fish stocks in Icelandic waters since spring 1985. These researches have been carried out by bottom trawls. Since 1996 the bottom trawling has been carried out also in autumn. The purpose of this research has been to gather information on the development of fish stocks as well as the distribution of their length, weight and age. The main focus in this thesis lies on cod (Gadus morhua). While observing the Icelandic fishing industry, the importance of cod is greater than other species. This thesis focuses on the data gathered by bottom trawls between spring 1985 and autumn 2010. The species included to this thesis are cod and haddock (Melangrammus aeglefinus). The results base largely on the average lengths and weights and how these two vary between different age groups. The average lengths have increased slightly in 21st century for both cod and haddock. In the spring survey carried out in 1985-2010 the average length for cod was 40-50 cm while in the autumn survey carried out 1996-2010 the average length had risen to 50-60 cm. In the spring survey the average length for haddock was 30-40 cm while in the autumn survey the average length had risen to 35-45 cm. Also the average weights have increased during the survey for both cod and haddock. However, the amounts for total catches have not shown any remarkable recovery. While trying to preserve sustainable fish stocks, creating new and more precise catching methods have an important role. This reduces the amount of bycatches and would also help the regulation of fish stocks.
