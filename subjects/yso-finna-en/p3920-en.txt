regulation (adjustment)
The objective of the workshop was to develop national capacity and promote bilateral, subregional and regional coordination so that countries would be better placed to strengthen and harmonize port state measures and, as a result, implement the relevant tools of the 2001 FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, the 2005 FAO Model Scheme on Port State Measures to Combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and the 2009 Chairperson's draft Agreement on Port State Measures to Combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, when it enters into force.--Publisher's description.

This is a book about the research process that led scientists to the discovery of a group of molecules that act as carriers of information among the cells of our body, which the book refers to collectively as "body messages." Among the thousands of body messages, the author selected those that are part of her own research, the cytokines, adipokines, and other proteins that regulate inflammation and metabolism. She also interviewed twenty researchers who contributed significantly to the field, asking details about their discoveries while also inquiring about their life and education. Along with scientists' personal recollections, the book reconstructs the discovery process based on published reports of the original experimental findings. Though the book's main theme is the process of discovery, it devotes considerable space to the biology of body messages and the consequence of their identification for medical practice.--

Event related brain potential (ERP) correlates of activation and effort in state regulation among children with attentional problems
This publication presents guidelines on the requirements for responsible management of the fisheries exploiting Caribbean queen conch (Strombus gigas), with particular emphasis on the requirements to comply with the relevant regulations of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Caribbean queen conch is listed on Appendix II of the CITES, which requires that any specimen of the species can only be exported if a permit has been issued to allow the export. Further, CITES states that export permits should only be issued when the responsible authority has deemed that the export will not be detrimental to the survival of that species. This manual describes the basic fisheries management cycle which includes: development and interpretation of policy; the need for management controls to regulate fishing activities; data collection and analysis; decision-making; enforcement of and compliance with the management controls; and regular feedback and review of the management system. It provides general guidance on each of those steps for the queen conch fisheries of the Caribbean. It also provides three examples of management systems for industrial, artisanal and non-directed fisheries. Part 1 covers the main issues and examples in a relatively non-technical manner and Part 2 explains similar issues in a more technical manner.

p53 - a switch in cellular circuit
Between 1998 and 2004, eleven out of the fifteen parliaments of the European Union (EU) countries debated whether to regulate prostitution at the national level, something that had, until then, been regulated by cities. Fears about globalization and the transfer of sovereignty to the EU created a context in which nations asserted themselves by imposing national standards to protect vulnerable women, strengthening states in the face of "global" pressures. Prostitution reforms allowed governments to apprehend women who are "loose" in the sense that they lack formal or clear connections to state benefits, national labor markets, or international human rights protections. Case studies of the first four EU countries that reformed prostitution, The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, and Finland, are told through ninety in-depth interviews with people who helped craft, implement, or enforce new prostitution policies. Departing from previous accounts that stress the differences within these debates, The Cultural Politics of European Prostitution Reform instead analyzes their commonalities, foregrounding the increasing moral power of the state in a globalizing world and the endurance of national cultural difference.
