The book of the geranium
Pelargonium micropropagation and pathogen elimination : COST 87 : a report of the Pelargonium Working Group
Effects of pre- and post-transplant inoculation with commercial arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on pelargonium (Pelargonium hortorum) and its microorganism community
A comprehensive, highly illustrated guide to these spectacular plants. It described the range of garden-worthy plants to grow, and includes more than 250 photographs of the most interesting of them. The book also contains descriptions of foliage and flowers for all varieties, such as wood and dusky cranesbills, zonals, ivies, highfields, stellars, butes, regals and many more; tips on how to choose the right place for the right plant; instruction on growing and propagating; how to deal with pests and diseases; and mail-order sources.--COVER.
Pelargonium micropropagation and pathogen elimination
Hardy geraniums
Rooted cuttings of geranium were grown with and without a slow release fertilizer and inoculated or not with a commercial inoculum containing AM fungi. After six weeks plants were transplanted into larger containers and one-half of the plants were inoculated with AM. Inoculation increased pelargonium growth along with nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium concentrations in shoot than caused a slight decrease in shoot growth and enhanced N concentration.    Colony forming units of total fungi and bacteria in the rhizosphere were not influenced by AM;  although RFLP profiles of DNA isolated from bacteria living in rhizosphere showed a more diverse community in AM-inoculated than non-inoculated plants at low nutrient supply. Our results suggest that mycorrhizal inoculation not only has an effect on plant growth and uptake of elements but it also influences directly or indirectly the bacterial community of the rhizosphere.
