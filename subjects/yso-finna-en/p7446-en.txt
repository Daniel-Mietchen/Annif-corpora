First published in 1991, this thesis concentrates upon the design of three-dimensional, rather than the traditional two-dimensional, circuits. The theory behind such circuits is presented in detail, together with experimental results. Winner of the Distinguished Dissertation in Computer Science award, this work will prove invaluable to both designers and hardware engineers involved in the development of practical three-dimensional integrated circuits.

Designed for junior-and senior-level courses in Plant and Facilities Planning and Manufacturing Systems and Procedures, this textbook is also suitable for graduate-level and two-year college courses. The book takes a practical, hands-on, project-oriented approach to exploring the techniques and procedures for developing an efficient facility layout. It also introduces state-of-the-art tools including computer simulation. Access to Layout-iQ workspace planning software is included for purchasers of the book. Theoretical concepts are clearly explained and then rapidly applied to a practical setting through a detailed case study at the end of the volume. The book systematically leads students through the collection, analysis, and development of information to produce a quality functional plant layout for a lean manufacturing environment. All aspects of facility design, from receiving to shipping, are covered. In the fifth edition of this successful book, previously published by Prentice Hall, numerous updates and corrections have been made. Also, rather than including brief ?case-in-point? examples at the end of each chapter, a single, detailed case study is provided that better exposes students to the multiple considerations that need to be taken into account when improving efficiency in a real manufacturing facility. The textbook has enjoyed substantial international adoptions and has been translated into Spanish and Chinese.

This thesis goes through the process of creating a graphic design of a web page which includes determining all the components and how they can affect the visual outcome. The main task is to create a design plan for a website by creating images with an image editing software with the support of theoretical knowledge, end users’ preferences, and creativity. The aim is to create a modern design considering the responsive functions and the users’ needs. The users’ perspectives, needs, and habits are explored by interviewing companies supplied by the commissioner. The theoretical research contributes technical guidance on making choices in the design of a web page. The designs were made with Adobe Photoshop, which was accessible at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences, as was the recorder used in the interviews. The images in the designs were chosen from the commissioner’s existing website. The colours used in the designs were designated with the help of a colour wheel application. This thesis may be used by the commissioner for their webpage as well as anyone who is working with visual designs and looking for some theoretical explanations. The information covers many aspects of design as a webpage is a whole consisting of many components, such as text, layouts, and various types of graphics.

This Bachelor's thesis is about designing a production floor layout for Scandinavian Fabrication and also considering the differences between large companies and smaller entrepreneurs when creating plans for productions operation and determining the concept on based which the layout is built. First, there is the theory of CNC-machining and what are the most common production's processes. There is also coverage of layout theory and what are the basics of different production processes and how they affect production management, operations management, and from layout planning's view. The designing of layout is challenging due to the demands of the company and it's goals in the future. There's a section looking at the differences between a large and small company and how the size affects the layout-process and what are the experiences on the system of the smaller company with going through different factors affecting the design.

This thesis was done for the mechanical engineering department of Pöyry Industry Plc. The objective of this thesis was to construct a new 3D plant layout library, which will enable objects or components to be searched for easily in the library system. In addition to the enhanced layout library system, object attributes were also developed; the aim of this was to improve the component or object description data, which will enable components or objects to be found more easily in the library system. The library must be able to meet future needs and function efficiently.  In the theoretical part of the thesis, information on the basic layout design and fundamentals, and workflow of a plant engineering project are presented. The Cadmatic Plant Modeller system provides several possibilities since it is an integrated, database-driven design module for 3D layout, piping, HVAC and structural design of plants. In addition, computer applications relevant to this thesis were also discussed. The empirical part of this thesis began by compiling an equipment or component list, which was done by professional engineers based on commonly used components or objects during various projects. This required a good understanding of the components or objects and also good communication with the parties involved in the previous project where these components had been previously used. All the components or objects listed were imported into the new library and updated with the new object attribute that was developed as a result of this thesis.  As a result, an application was developed for the use of the company. A new library system was created to store objects or components required for future projects. In addition an object attribute was developed in connection to the object or component in the library system, which contains descriptive information about components or objects in the library system. The ultimate goals of this thesis were met.

The best of newspaper design : 25th edition : the society for news design competition for 2003
PJP Metsäexpertit Oy is a medium-sized forestry company operating in Pirkanmaa region. The company's main operations are harvesting and bio energy fuel logging, including forwarding. In addition to the main operations PJP carries out support functions such as drawing up of harvesting work schedules, repair and maintenance operations as well as coordination of their sub-contractors' work. On top of the current business operations, PJP is becoming a spare part dealer and contract maintenance service provider for Swedish forestry machine manufacturer Eco Log. Embarking on this new field of business requires planning and designing. The most important needs at this stage for PJP are to have the spare part storage layout and stock location scheme as well as basic warehouse operations designed. Hence, the goal of the design work is to recommend a storage layout solution which meets overall objectives and company requirements as well as create functional and efficient basic warehouse operations and stock location scheme according to the company's specific situation.   The layout model recommended in this thesis was achieved by defining the characteristics of the stored materials, choosing the suitable storage method and techniques and taking into consideration the limitations and opportunities of the space. The recommended layout is static small and medium-sized spare part storage with shelving and lockers as the main storage devices. This solution reaches the overall objectives of an economical storage which enables efficient use of space and material handling, provides flexibility required in the changing business environment as well as adheres to the case company specific requirements. Acquiring of the storage fitting, accessories and equipment according to the recommendations further increases the overall functionality and efficiency of the layout. The designing of the basic warehouse operations includes receiving, storage, picking, packing and shipping activities. The company's ERP system is an essential tool along with the stock location scheme to enable efficient operations. The stock location scheme is based on the recommended storage layout and each stock location is identified with a unique code. The objective of efficient yet economical warehousing is reached with the right systems and procedures in place and with suitable equipment. In addition to the procedures and systems presented in the thesis, it is recommended that in the future PJP considers the use of bar coding in its warehouse operations since it can offer many benefits in terms of information accuracy and overall operational efficiency.
