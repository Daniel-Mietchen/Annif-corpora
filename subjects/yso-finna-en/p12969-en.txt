Frontier Investor : How to Prosper in the Next Emerging Markets
Guide for foreign investors : republic of Latvia
Frontier markets account for 15 percent of global GDP, yet global investors largely ignore them. Fueled by access to technology and information, these markets are emerging even faster than their predecessors, making them an essential component of a globally diversified portfolio. In Frontier Investor, Marko Dimitrijevic makes the case for their inclusion, arguing&#x0097;through a diverse set of case studies&#x0097;that it is possible if not wise to make informed investing decisions about these unfamiliar and undervalued markets. Markets that were considered exotic two decades ago&#x0097;China, India, South Africa, and Russia&#x0097;are today's mainstream. Dimitrijevic begins with an analysis of how this came to be and looks at the markets that are poised to follow a similar path. He then details a strategy for how and where to invest directly or indirectly for those with limited access but who still wish to profit from emerging market growth. Dimitrijevic covers the political and other risks of taking advantage of these opportunities and the megatrends that may provide new options and open up new countries, such as Cuba and Iran, to exponential growth.

"Expansion of biofuel investment in Africa has been supported by indebted poor governments because of perceived potential benefits such as sustainable energy development, support to poor farmers, development of rural economies and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the intensity of the biofuels political economy in poor countries worsens inequality for the vulnerable poor. This is evidenced by large-scale land acquisitions in Africa for biofuel and crop production primarily for foreign consumption - food, animal feeds and energy crops. The search for land in African countrieshas been triggered by growing concerns over food and energy security in developed countries following the global food crisis of 2008. Moreover, these recent developments in large-scale land acquisitions in Africa are not a new phenomenon, but represent the renewal of old practices incommercial agriculture, which is either conducted through purchases or long-term leases. In addition to biofuel expansion, this study notes that current large-scale land acquisitions in sub-Saharan Africa have been further driven by demands to access water resources for other commercial agricultural crops. The land purchases or leases automatically guarantee access to African water. This demand for water is a response to climate change: most industrialists believe that acquiring land near a main water reservoir will guarantee future agricultural potential. Few analyses have been done on the land-water access nexus. This article considers recent developments in large-scaleland acquisitions in Africa in terms of water security for commercial agriculture to safeguard the production of agricultural crops with a large water footprint. Using political economy analysis, this article examines national policy on these acquisitions, the rights accorded to foreign investors and how land acquisitions undermine indigenous rights to the common resources that have been the mainsource of livelihood in sub-Saharan Africa." --Publisher's description.
