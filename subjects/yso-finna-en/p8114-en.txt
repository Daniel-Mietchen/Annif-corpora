"Could a nightmare be used as a murder weapon? That's the provocative question confronting Gurney. The former NYPD star homicide detective is called upon to solve a baffling puzzle: Four people who live in different parts of the country and who seem to have little in common, report having had the same dream--a terrifying nightmare involving a bloody dagger with a carved wolf's head on the handle. All four are subsequently found with their wrists cut--apparent suicides--and the weapon used in each case was a wolf's head dagger. Police zero in quickly on Richard Hammond, a controversial psychologist who conducts hypnotherapy sessions at a spooky old Adirondack inn called Wolf Lake Lodge. It seems that each of the victims had gone there to meet with Hammond shortly before turning up dead. Troubled by odd holes in the official approach to the case, Gurney begins his own investigation--an action that puts him in the crosshairs of not only an icy murderer and the local police but the darkest corner of the federal government. As ruthless as the blizzard trapping him in the sinister eeriness of Wolf Lake, Gurney's enemies set out to keep him from the truth at any cost--including an all-out assault on the sanity of his beloved wife Madeleine. With his emotional resources strained to the breaking point, Gurney must throw himself into a deadly battle of wits with the most frightening opponent he has ever faced."

The novel of the famous Georgian writer, poet and playwright Tamaz Chiladze focuses on moral problems/issues, arisen as a result of too great a self-assuredness of psychologists. Its main character is an up-to-now successful psychotherapist, whose wife has left him. One day she suddenly realised that her marriage is nothing more than "fact/reality born out of habit" and her family is a branch of a hospital. For her husband she wasn't a beloved wife but just a patient. The heroine finds an exit from the vicious circle of misunderstanding and insensitivity.

Making the most of fieldwork education : a  practical approach
In dementia care, it has been widely recognized that not only providing medical treatment, but also building an appropriate care relationship between medical professionals and the persons with dementia is one of the keys for understanding the person's needs and for developing their residual physical and mental abilities. However, there has been little discussion about the meanings and contexts of the care relationship and the role of the therapeutic tools used and the therapist's expertise in establishing it. To examine these points, the following research questions were addressed: 1) as a mediating tool in the care relationship, what kinds of narratives were created through everyday interaction between therapists and dementia sufferers? 2) how and why were narratives constructed? 3) what is the teaching-learning process of the therapist through narrative joint formation?, and consequently, 4) what is the relationship in dementia care? The data was collected from interviews with one experienced occupational therapist and observations of his care sessions with two Alzheimer's disease (AD) sufferers in a Japanese nursing home for two years. Their interactions and narratives were transcribed and qualitatively analysed based on Vygotsky's cultural-historical approaches and Bakhtin's theory of dialogue in education as a theoretical framework. The results have shown that the therapist jointly created narratives and a triadic relationship between the AD sufferers, the narratives, and himself.Using the narratives, he arranged a dialogical environment where the AD sufferers could express their own voices and encounter the voices of others. This enabled them to learn the meaning of their therapeutic activity in connection to their own life experience. As cognitive/psychological tools, the narratives worked towards a teaching-learning process and helped to establish the care re lationship. Through the co-construction of narratives and the triadic relationship, the therapist listened to the AD sufferers' voices carefully, participated in an open ended and unfinalisable dialogue himself with them, and confronted them as equal respondents. In this sense, the therapist is seen as a dialogic teacher who actively learns knowledge and ideas from the dementia sufferers and unceasingly explores unknown questions in narratives with them.
