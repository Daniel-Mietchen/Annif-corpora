Trost in Verzweiflung : the sense and implication of an early Middle High German fragment
"Short comic tales in verse flourished in late medieval Germany, providing bawdy entertainment for larger audiences of public recitals as well as for smaller numbers of individual readers. In a sustained close analysis Sebastian Coxon explores both the narrative design and fundamental thematic preoccupations of these short texts. A distinctively performative tradition of pre-modern narrative literature emerges which invited recipients for think, learn and above all to laugh in a number of different ways."--BOOK JACKET.
