Signal and image analysis techniques are becoming more widely used in biomedical and life science applications. With an emphasis on applications of computational models for solving modern challenging problems in biomedical and life sciences, this book aims to bring collections of articles from biologists, medical/biomedical and health science researchers together with computational scientists to focus on problems at the frontier of biomedical and life sciences. The goals of this book are to build interactions of scientists across several disciplines and to help industrial users apply advanced computational techniques for solving practical biomedical and life science problems. This book is for users in the fields of biomedical and life sciences who wish to keep abreast with the latest techniques in signal and image analysis. The book presents a detailed description to some of the applications. It can be used by those both at graduate and specialist levels.

"Chapter 1 An introduction to next-generation biological platforms Virginia Mohlere, Wenting Wang, and Ganiraju Manyam The University of Texas. MD Anderson Cancer Center 1.1 Introduction When Sanger and Coulson first described a reliable, efficient method for DNA sequencing in 1975 (Sanger and Coulson, 1975), they made possible the full sequencing of both genes and entire genomes. Although the method was resource-intensive, many institutions invested in the necessary equipment, and Sanger sequencing remained the standard for the next 30 years. Refinement of the process increased read lengths from around 25 to 2 Mohlere, Wang, and Manyam almost 750 base pairs (Schadt et al., 2010, fig. 1). While this greatly increased efficiency and reliability, the Sanger method still required not only large equipment but significant human investment, as the process requires the work of several people. This prompted researchers and companies such as Applied Biosystems to seek improved sequencing techniques and instruments. Starting in the late 2000s, new instruments came on the market that, although they actually decreased read length, lessened run time and could be operated more easily with fewer human resources (Schadt et al., 2010). Despite discoveries that have illuminated new therapeutic targets, clarified the role of specific mutations in clinical response, and yielded new methods for diagnosis and predicting prognosis (Chin et al., 2011), the initial promise of genomic data has largely remained so far unfulfilled. The difficulties are numerous"--

"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are heptahelical transmembrane receptors that convert extra-cellular stimuli into intra-cellular signaling, and ultimately into biological responses. Since GPCRs are natural targets for approximately 40% of all modern medicines, it is not surprising that they have been the subject of intense research. Notwithstanding the amount of data generated over the years, discovering ligands of these receptors with optimal therapeutic properties is not straightforward and has certainly been hampered for years by the lack of high-resolution structural information about these receptors. Luckily, there has been a steady increase of high-resolution crystal structures of these receptors since 2007, and this information, integrated with dynamic inferences from computational and experimental methods, holds great potential for the discovery of new, improved drugs. This book, which provides, for the first time, state-of-the-art views on modeling and simulation of GPCRs, is divided into 4 parts. In the first part, the impact of currently available GPCR crystal structures on structural modeling is discussed extensively as are critical insights from simulations in the second part of the book. The third part reports recent progress in rational ligand discovery and mathematical modeling, whereas the fourth part provides an overview of bioinformatics tools and resources that are available for GPCRs." -- (Back Cover)
