"This book outlines important suggestions by international experts to improve the health of those in prison and to reduce both the health risks and risks to society of imprisonment. In particular, it aims to facilitate better prison health practices in the fields of: (i) human rights and medical ethics, (ii) communicable diseases, (iii) noncommunicable diseases, (iv) oral health, (v) risk factors, (vi) vulnerable groups and (vii) prison health management. It is aimed at professional staff at all levels of responsibility for the health and well-being of detainees and at people with political responsibility. The term 'prison' covers all institutions where a state holds people deprived of their liberty." -- (WHO Europe)
