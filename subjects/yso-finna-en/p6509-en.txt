"A stimulating and thought-provoking analysis of the issues faced in the real world of midwifery and maternity care! Rosemary Mander discusses the context of contemporary childbearing and analyses a range of political in the broadest sense  issues which need to be understood and addressed by those practising in a system of public maternity care, particularly the new midwife. Designed to help professionals cope with the transition from education and the ideals which brought them into health care to the reality of the system within which they learn and practise, this text includes successful strategies and lessons from which to learn. Drawing on recent and current international research, The Politics of Maternity demonstrates the commonality of the system-related challenges and develops some more constructive approaches to managing them, avoiding feelings of isolation and disengagement This inspiring book is designed to assist midwives to function and care effectively in a changing health care environment, rather than succumbing under pressure, for the benefit of mothers, babies and practitioners"-- Provided by publisher.

The purpose of this article is to examine professional practices in matemity and child health care in two countries, Finland and Scotland, concentrating on how motherhood is located in family context, on how family is defined and worked with. Subthemes analysed are the role of fathers, 'family support' fr mothers and the discussion over lone motherhood. The study was carried out through local case studies using ethnographic methods, mainly observation and interviews with health professionals. Results show that Finnish health professionals have adopted a family-oriented way of working emphasising the importance of pair relationships and shared parenthood, compared with their Scottish colleagues, who work in a more women-oriented way and emphasise the role of other women as social support fr mothers. In conclusion the two different professional orientations are connected to wider social and cultural differences between the two countries. .

This benchmark collection of cross-cultural essays on reproduction and childbirth extends and enriches the work of Brigitte Jordan, who helped generate and define the field of the anthropology of birth. The authors' focus on authoritative knowledge - the knowledge that counts, on the basis of which decisions are made and actions taken - highlights the vast differences between birthing systems that give authority of knowing to women and their communities and those that invest it in experts and machines. Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge offers first-hand ethnographic research conducted by anthropologists in sixteen different societies and cultures and includes the interdisciplinary perspectives of a social psychologist, a sociologist, an epidemiologist, a staff member of the World Health Organization, and a community midwife. Exciting directions for further research as well as pressing needs for policy guidance emerge from these illuminating explorations of authoritative knowledge about birth. This book is certain to follow Jordan's Birth in Four Cultures as the definitive volume in a rapidly expanding field.

"This third edition of Introductory Maternity and Pediatric Nursing reflects the underlying philosophy of love, caring, and support for the childbearing woman, the child, and the families of these individuals. The content has been developed according to the most current information available. In this text, we recognize that cultural sensitivity and awareness are important aspects of caring for the childbearing and child-rearing families. We also recognize that many children and pregnant women live in families other than traditional two-parent family homes and therefore refer to teaching and supporting the childbearing clients and family caregivers of children in all situations and family structures"--Provided by publisher.

The emergency obstetric care indicators described in this handbook can be used to measure progress in a programmatic continuum: from the availability of and access to emergency obstetric care to the use and quality of those services. This handbook is an update of an earlier publication on monitoring the availability and use of obstetric services, issued by UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA in 1997. This revision incorporates changes based on monitoring and assessment conducted worldwide and the emerging evidence on the topic over the years, and has been agreed by an international panel of experts. It includes two new indicators and an additional signal function, with updated evidence and new resources.--Publisher's description.
