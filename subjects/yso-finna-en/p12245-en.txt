Allgemeine Entwurfsanstalt with Trix and Robert Haussmann : furniture for Röthlisberger Kollektion
This book is designed to help people who think in pictures--a segment of learners that by some estimates includes almost 30 percent of the population--gain skills and confidence in their writing abilities. Writing for Visual Thinkers approaches the craft of writing from many directions, all with the ultimate goal of unblocking the reader's verbal potential. Both experimental and pragmatic, Marks's methods will result in stronger, more verbally confident artists and designers.

Xavier Lust is certainly one of the most relevant characters on the contemporary design scene. His distinct and essential approach to design, his ingenious and refined touch, and his ability to synthesize clearly imply a special talent. The great John Keats wrote: "A thing of beauty is a joy forever, its loveliness increases, it will never pass into nothingness". For Xavier Lust, dedication to beauty is the answer to eternity and this forever is actually built everyday through constant work, research and curiosity. Always focused on innovation and research, specifically tension and induced motion, he likes to experiment, explore and discover the natural transformations of materials. On the strength of his experience with metal, he challenges all kind of materials, challenging himself too in the process. Xavier Lust pushes the boundaries of technical possibilities while making a statement with each of his pieces and overriding preconceived ideas. Design Stories aims to give a wide sense of Lust's work in the different fields of design from creation to production to final destination.

Studio Job redefines the applied arts for the contemporary age. Job Smeets and Nynke Tynagel's collaboration creates highly expressive work where the physical potential of the materials they use-often bronze or laser-cut marquetry-is pushed to the limit, with an approach more in keeping with that of traditional guilds than industrial design. Studio Job: Monkey Business includes furnishings, sculptures, exhibitions, commissioned interiors, and the designers' own home, tracing the past five years of Studio Job's creative vision. Opulent, intricate, and ironic, the work of Studio Job combines an extraordinarily high level of craftsmanship with extreme ornamentation. Studio Job draws from the traditional and the topical, the organic and the artificial. With design inspired by illuminated manuscripts and more than 200 sketches, concept renderings, and photographs, Studio Job: Monkey Business is the ultimate expression of two of the most influential designers working today. Exhibition: Museum of Arts and Design, New York, USA (22.03-21.08.2016) / Design Museum, London, UK (fall 2016)
