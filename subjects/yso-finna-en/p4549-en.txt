Campylobacter is a leading cause of enteric infections in many countries. The principal reservoir of pathogenic Campylobacter spp. is the alimentary tract of wild and domesticated mammals and birds. FAO and WHO have undertaken a risk assessment of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens. An interpretative summary of that work is described in this volume. This assessment compared the risk for a variety of scenarios and mitigation measures for control of the organism in a range of broiler chicken products. This volume contains information that is useful to both risk assessors and risk managers, governments and food regulatory agencies, industry and other people or institutions with an interest in Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens, the public health impact and the use of risk assessment in the evaluation and selection of potential control strategies--Publisher's description.

As the world gets more industrialized and its population rises, the question of waste management becomes more and more relevant every day. The issues concerning solid waste management are global, and operators in different fields need to take responsibility for the waste that their operations create.     This final thesis presents a new waste management plan for the distribution warehouse of Valio Ltd. Tampere. Valio Ltd is the leading dairy product manufacturer in Finland and it employs directly and indirectly about 30 000 persons (Valio Oy 2015a, 2015b). Nearly 80 of these employees are working in the distribution warehouse of Valio Ltd. Tampere.  The work for this thesis was done between January and May 2015. The main focus points of the waste management reform in the warehouse of Valio Ltd. Tampere are the reduction of mixed waste and energy waste, and better recovery of the recyclable materials. The new plan is based on reducing the size of the waste bins and locating them close to where the waste is produced. Well-functioning waste management releases space and resources for other operations at the warehouse.    The materials that were used as source information for the new waste management plan were literature such as legislation and the waste-handling guidelines of the Tampere Regional Solid Waste Management Company. Several discussions with the employees and management of Valio Ltd. Tampere, as well as a questionnaire on the target group's recycling habits provided input for the new waste management plan.    According to the findings of this thesis, it seems that training employees and organizing their work environment so that recycling is made easy will lead to the wanted results. In this case, the results were better recovery of recyclable materials and minimization of the amount of waste being disposed of in rubbish dumps.  The new waste management plan has been successfully implemented at the warehouse, and the maintenance of waste collection points is functioning properly. The aim of the thesis was to create a well-functioning waste management plan for the Valio Ltd. Tampere distribution warehouse, and that aim has been achieved, and completed on schedule.      The public version of this thesis does not contain the layout of the warehouse (Appendix 4), and the annual amount of waste generated at the warehouse.     Key words: waste management plan, recycling, source separation.

This book explains how designing, playing and modifying computer games, and understanding the theory behind them, can strengthen the area of digital humanities. This book aims to help digital humanities scholars understand both the issues and also advantages of game design, as well as encouraging them to extend the field of computer game studies, particularly in their teaching and research in the field of virtual heritage. By looking at re-occurring issues in the design, playtesting and interface of serious games and game-based learning for cultural heritage and interactive history, this book highlights the importance of visualisation and self-learning in game studies and how this can intersect with digital humanities. It also asks whether such theoretical concepts can be applied to practical learning situations. It will be of particular interest to those who wish to investigate how games and virtual environments can be used in teaching and research to critique issues and topics in the humanities, particularly in virtual heritage and interactive history.

Food Industry Wastes: Assessment and Recuperation of Commodities presents emerging techniques and opportunities for the treatment of food wastes, the reduction of water footprint, and creating sustainable food systems. Written by a team of experts from around the world, this book will provide a key resource for implementing processes as well as giving researchers a starting point for the development of new options for the recuperation of these waste for community benefit. There were over 34 million tons of food waste generated in the US alone in 2009 - at a cost of approximately $43 billion. And while less than 3% of that waste was recovered and recycled, there is growing interest and development in finding ways to utilize this waste in ways that will not only reduce greenhouse gasses, but provide energy, and potentially provide resources for other purposes. Food waste is an area of focus for a wide range of related industries from food science to energy and engineering. This international authoring team represents the leading edge in research and development. Provides insights on leading areas of current research as well as looking toward future opportunities for reusing food waste.
This qualitative study reports on lactic acid bacteria (LAB), yeasts and moulds isolated from three artisanal Swedish cellar-stored goat cheeses aged for 1, 3 and 5 months. Starter culture LAB dominated in the younger cheeses, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, common in raw goats' milk, had persisted from the unpasteurised milk into all the cheeses. Non-starter LAB dominated in the 5 month cheese, in particular, Lactobacillus sakei, a meat-associated LAB not previously isolated from cheese. Debaryomyces hansenii, and Penicillium and Mucor species were dominant among the yeasts and moulds, respectively. The cheese rind was not formed primarily from Penicillium species as in traditional cheeses such as Camembert - rather, mycelium from Mucor mucedo contributed to rind formation. Mould species known to produce sterigmatocystin, aflatoxins or ochratoxin A in cheese were not isolated in this study; growth of mycotoxigenic Aspergilli may have been inhibited by the cool conditions in the earth-cellar (4-6 °C).

Human abilities : an information-processing approach
This book is devoted to the application of advanced signal processing on event-related potentials (ERPs) in the context of electroencephalography (EEG) for the cognitive neuroscience. ERPs are usually produced through averaging single-trials of preprocessed EEG, and then, the interpretation of underlying brain activities is based on the ordinarily averaged EEG. We find that randomly fluctuating activities and artifacts can still present in the averaged EEG data, and that constant brain activities over single trials can overlap with each other in time, frequency and spatial domains. Therefore, before interpretation, it will be beneficial to further separate the averaged EEG into individual brain activities. The book proposes systematic approaches pre-process wavelet transform (WT), independent component analysis (ICA), and nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) to filter averaged EEG in time, frequency and space domains to sequentially and simultaneously obtain the pure ERP of interest. Software of the proposed approaches will be open-accessed.

This book provides a contemporary approach to the study of bilingualism. Drawing on contributions from leading experts in the field, this book brings together - in a single volume - a selection of the exciting work conducted as part of the programme of the ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory and Practice at Bangor University, Wales. Each chapter has as its main focus an exploration of the relationship between the two languages of a bilingual. Section by section, the authors draw on current findings and methodologies to explore the ways in which their research can address this question from a number of different perspectives.
