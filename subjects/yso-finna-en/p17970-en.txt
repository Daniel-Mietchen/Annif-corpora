Art and life in modernist Prague : Karel Čapek and his generation, 1911-1938
In this strange and lovely hymn to Prague, Michal Ajvaz repopulates thecity of Kafka with ghosts, eccentrics, talking animals, and impossible statues, all lurking on the peripheries of a town so familiar to tourists. The Other City is a guidebook to this invisible, "other Prague," overlapping the workaday world: a place where libraries can turn into jungles, secret passages yawn beneath our feet, and waves lap at our bedspreads. Heir to the tradition and obsessions of Jorge Luis Borges, as well as the long and distinguished line of Czech fantasists, Ajvaz's Other City, his first novel to be translated into English, is the emblem of all the worlds we are blind to, being caught in our own ways of seeing.
Spoken Czech in literature : the case of Bondy, Hrabal, Placák and Topol
Vladislav Vančura: the heart of the Czech avant-garde
The stories capture a time when Czech Stalinists were turning society upside down, inflicting their social and political experiments on mostly unwilling subjects. These stories are set variously in the gas-lit streets of post-war Prague; on the raucous and dangerous factory floor of the famous Poldi steelworks where Hrabal himself once worked; in a cacophonous open-air dance hall where classical and popular music come to blows; at the basement studio where a crazed artist attempts to fashion a national icon; on the scaffolding around a decommissioned church. Hrabal captures men and women trapped in an eerily beautiful nightmare, longing for a world where â??humor and metaphysical escape can reign supreme.â?

"Vita Nuova" is the second in a trilogy of memoirs written from the perspective of Bohumil Hrabal's wife, Eliska, about their life in Prague from the 1950s to the 1970s, when Communist repression of artists was at its peak. Hrabal's inimitable humor, which in Eliska's ruminations ranges from bawdy slapstick to cutting irony, is all the more penetrating for being directed at himself. "Vita Nuova" showcases Hrabal's legendary bohemian intellectual life, particularly his relationship with Vladimir Boudnik. Hrabal creates a shrewd, lively portrait of Eastern European intellectual life in the mid-twentieth century.

Czech literature at the turn of the millennium = : Neue tschechische Literatur an der Jahrtausendwende
Inspired by "Mrs. Tolstoy and Mrs. Dostoevsky, whose biographies about their husbands have now been published in Prague," Bohumil Hrabal decided to produce his own autobiographical work, ostensibly fiction, from his wife's point of view. He would write, he said, "not a putdown about myself, but a little bit of how it all was, that marriage of ours, with myself as a jewel and adornment of our life together." The task, taken up by such a rogue comic talent, could be nothing other than strangely delightful; and in "In-House Weddings", the first of the trilogy that Hrabal produced, we meet the author through the eyes of his wife Eliska. She narrates his life from his upbringing in Nymburk through his work as a dispatcher in a train station and then in a scrap paper plant, his first publication, his trouble with the authorities, and his association with notable artists and authors such as Jiri Kolar, Vladimir Boudnik, and Arnost Lustig. Hrabal's bohemian life was itself a source of great interest to the Czech public; transmuted here, it is even more compelling, a wry portrait of artistic life in postwar Eastern Europe and a telling reflection on how such a life might be recast in the light of literary brilliance.
