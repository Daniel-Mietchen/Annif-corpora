The crustal and upper mantle structures of the Shield on the regional scale were investigated using the data of the POLENET/LAPNET passive seismic array and the previously published models of active and passive seismic experiments in the study area. This area is centred in northern Finland and it extends to surrounding areas in Sweden, Norway and northwestern Russia. The bedrock there is mostly of the Archaean origin and the lithosphere of the region was reworked by two orogenies during Palaeoproterozoic.One of the results of the thesis was a new map of the Moho depth of the study area, for which new estimates of the crustal thickness were obtained using receiver function method and complemented by published results of receiver function studies and controlled source seismic profiles. The map differs from the previously published maps in two locations, where we found significant deepening of the Moho. The 3D structure of the upper mantle was studied using teleseismic traveltime tomography method. The resulting model shows high seismic velocities below three cratonic units of the study area, which may correspond to non-reworked fragments of cratonic lithosphere and a low velocity anomaly separating these cratonic units from each other.The regional scale studies were complemented by two smaller scale studies in upper crust level using combined interpretation of seismic profiling and gravity data. These studies were centred on Archaean Kuhmo Greenstone Belt in eastern Finland and central Lapland in northern Finland located in the crust reworked during Palaeoproterozoic. Both areas are considered as prospective ones for mineral exploration. Both studies demonstrate the advantage of gravity data inversion in studying 3D density structure of geologically interesting formations, when the Bouguer anomaly data is combined with a priori information from petrophysical and seismi c datasets.

The study was planned to find evidence on potential cultural factors in occurrence and distribution of soil-living mites (Oribatida and Mesostigmata) in Finland. Samples were taken from meadows, gardens and forest edges at (a) isolated cottages and (b) culturally exposed farms in two areas, Sipoo/Mäntsälä and Ilomantsi. Multiple factorial analyses revealed significant differences only between the areas. Number of species was lower in Ilomantsi, where several ”southern” species were absent. The typical forest species were more abundant in the forest habitat. There was no difference between ”Cottages” and ”Farms”..

"The book summarizes the author's experimental studies of phase relations in the chemical systems relevant to Earth, carried out in a time period of over 20 years using piston-cylinder and multi-avil presses. The results from the high-pressure studies by many other experimental petrologists were also included. The data were used to develop an internally consistent thermodynamic model, which was then used to calculate phase diagrams. This produced the largest collection of the calculated phase diagrams published so far, encompassing for the first time the temperature and pressure ranges corresponding to the whole upper mantle."--BOOK JACKET.
