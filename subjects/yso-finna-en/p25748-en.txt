"This book presents an overview of the foundations and the key ideas and results of linear and generalized linear models under one cover. Written by a prolific academic, researcher, and textbook writer, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is soon to become the gold standard by which all existing textbooks on the topic will be compared. While the emphasis is clearly and succinctly on theoretical underpinnings, applications in "R" are presented when they help to elucidate the content or promote practical model building. Each chapter contains approximately 15-20 exercises, primarily for readers to practice and extend the theory, but, also to assimilate the ideas by doing some data analysis. The carefully crafted models and examples convey basic concepts and do not get mired down in non-trivial considerations. An author-maintained web site includes, among other numerous pedagogical supplements, analyses that parallel the "R" routines from the book in SAS, SPSS and Stata"--

This book examines Stata's treatment of generalized linear mixed models, also known as multilevel or hierarchical models. These models are "mixed" because they allow fixed and random effects, and they are "generalized" because they are appropriate for continuous Gaussian responses as well as binary, count, and other types of limited dependent variables. Volume I covers continuous Gaussian linear mixed models and has nine chapters. The chapters are organized in four parts. Volume II discusses generalized linear mixed models for binary, categorical, count, and survival outcomes.

"Over the past ten years, there have been many important advances in log-linear modeling, including the specification of new models, in particular non-standard models, and their relationships to methods such as Rasch modeling. While most literature on the topic is contained in volumes aimed at advanced statisticians, Applied Log-Linear Modeling presents the topic in an accessible style that is customized for applied researchers who utilize log-linear modeling in the social sciences. The book begins by providing readers with a foundation on the basics of log-linear modeling, introducing decomposing effects in cross-tabulations and goodness-of-fit tests. Popular hierarchical log-linear models are illustrated using empirical data examples, and odds ratio analysis is discussed as an interesting method of analysis of cross-tabulations. Next, readers are introduced to the design matrix approach to log-linear modeling, presenting various forms of coding (effects coding, dummy coding, Helmert contrasts etc.) and the characteristics of design matrices. The book goes on to explore non-hierarchical and nonstandard log-linear models, outlining ten nonstandard log-linear models (including nonstandard nested models, models with quantitative factors, logit models, and log-linear Rasch models) as well as special topics and applications. A brief discussion of sampling schemes is also provided along with a selection of useful methods of chi-square decomposition. Additional topics of coverage include models of marginal homogeneity, rater agreement, methods to test hypotheses about differences in associations across subgroup, the relationship between log-linear modeling to logistic regression, and reduced designs. Throughout the book, Computer Applications chapters feature SYSTAT, Lem, and R illustrations of the previous chapter's material, utilizing empirical data examples to demonstrate the relevance of the topics in modern research"--

"Designed for graduate students and researchers in the behavioral, social, health, and medical sciences, this text employs generalized linear models, including mixed models, for categorical and limited dependent variables. Categorical variables include both nominal and ordinal variables. Discrete or continuous limited dependent variables have restricted support, whether through censorship or truncation or by their nature. The book incorporates examples of truncated counts, censored continuous variables, and doubly bounded continuous variables, such as percentages. "--

"This entry-level text offers clear and concise guidelines on how to select, construct, interpret, and evaluate count data. Written for researchers with little or no background in advanced statistics, the book presents treatments of all major models using numerous tables, insets, and detailed modeling suggestions. It begins by demonstrating the fundamentals of linear regression and works up to an analysis of the Poisson and negative binomial models, and to the problem of overdispersion. Examples in Stata, R, and SAS code enable readers to adapt models for their own purposes, making the text an ideal resource for researchers working in public health, ecology, econometrics, transportation, and other related fields"--

"This book is devoted to dependent variables other than those for which linear regression is appropriate. The authors argue that such dependent variables are, if anything, more common throughout the human sciences than the kind that suit linear regression. Presenting a broader but unified coverage in which the authors attempt to integrate concepts and ideas shared across models and types of data broader but unified coverage in which we attempt to integrate the concepts and ideas shared across models and types of data, especially regarding conceptual links between discrete and continuous limited dependent variables"--

The aim of this book is an applied and unified introduction into parametric, non- and semiparametric regression that closes the gap between theory and application. The most important models and methods in regression are presented on a solid formal basis, and their appropriate application is shown through many real data examples and case studies. Availability of (user-friendly) software has been a major criterion for the methods selected and presented. Thus, the book primarily targets an audience that includes students, teachers and practitioners in social, economic, and life sciences, as well as students and teachers in statistics programs, and mathematicians and computer scientists with interests in statistical modeling and data analysis. It is written on an intermediate mathematical level and assumes only knowledge of basic probability, calculus, and statistics. The most important definitions and statements are concisely summarized in boxes. Two appendices describe required matrix algebra, as well as elements of probability calculus and statistical inference.
