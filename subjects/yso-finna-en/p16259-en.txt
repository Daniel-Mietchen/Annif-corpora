What we believe in : noaidevuohta - an introduction to the religion of the Northern Saami
Nordic Neoshamanisms proposes that the drive for religiosity and experiences of the sacred are far from lost in contemporary western societies. However, the spiritual quest in Nordic countries comes in some very surprising and innovative forms which make it necessary to rethink the relationship between the religious and the secular world. The contributors do just this by focusing on the mechanisms of contemporary shamanism in these contexts. The contributors' objective is to explore the myriad of ways late modern shamanism is becoming more vital and personally significant to people, communities, and economies in Nordic countries. This book intends to survey how the field of modern shamanism is entwined with the political, the social and the popular in this area of the world. Drawing on case studies of particular persons, groups and institutions, well-known historians of religion and folklorists discuss how modern shamanism can be said to contribute to self-knowledge, identity, and community life in Northern European countries.

With a collection of updated texts on religion, healing practices, and beliefs, this book takes us from the time of the Sámi noaidi («shaman”) up to the present day. The book begins with a chapter on the pre-Christian noaidevuohta («shamanism”), followed by an account of the violent persecution of the Sámi pre-Christian way of life in the 1600s and 1700s. Then we are introduced to Laestadianism, the pietistic, Lutheran movement founded by Lars Levi Laestadius that took hold in the North and Lule Sámi areas in the middle of the 1850s. Finally, we learn about Sámi folk medicine traditions, which continue to exist alongside modern forms of medicine, thus representing cultural continuity and belief in traditional values from the time of the noaidi.
