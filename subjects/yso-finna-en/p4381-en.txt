The decision to carry out a merger or acquisition is certainly a risky one, not least because of the number of variables influencing the final outcome. It is also a decision frequently based on the wrong objectives and an incorrect evaluation process. With this in mind, this important new book offers solutions for reducing the high percentage of mergers and acquisitions (M & As) that fail. It adopts a normative approach, using theoretical analysis to show what managers could and should do to increase shareholders' value through successful M & A strategies. It also explores the conditions that are suitable for favouring a certain type of M&A (horizontal, vertical, or diversified) over the others.

"The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance"--

Mergers and acquisitions (hereafter also 'M&A') have been a common method for companies to grow and increase shareholder value. Brands relate to the experience stakeholders and herein especially customers enjoy when being in any interaction with a company. As a result of transactions, companies can only only ensure positive future financial performance and succeed in the market when also managing brand experiences systematically. This study examines the role of brands in international M&A with relation to financial performance among companies in Finland. The importance of brands in decision-making, the actions of brand management as well as the financial measurement of brands in transactions are in the focus of this study. Since this research was commissioned by a Finnish brand management consultancy called BrandWorxx Oy, the center of attention is also on suggestions for service development. The research at hand includes theories which are built around brands as well as M&A as key concepts. First of all, the term 'brand' is defined, the connection to financial performance illustrated and a systematic brand management process described. Next, M&A are introduced including motivations, the process as well as due diligence. After taking a look at company and brand valuation approaches, key concepts are connected and brand management as well as exploitation opportunities as part of M&A are shown. In order to meet the research objectives, empirical work with more qualitative but also quantitative aspects was carried out through mostly personal interviews. Results and findings show that the importance of brands as a decision-making criterion is of a relatively high importance level. However, brands are mostly not systematically managed nor financially tracked as part of transactions. Due to this, bigger financial value is assumed to be lost since stakeholders and especially customers are not in the focus of transactions. Finally, a need for the commissioning company to develop a specific service offering became obvious.The report thus provides detailed suggestions mentioned at the end of this study.

This book is one of the very few published investigations of international business in a Japanese context, based on an up-to-date overview of the Japanese mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in particular. The author explicates recent developments in Japanese business and shows how Japanese firms drastically change to reach out to become more globalized. The book can serve as a foundation in a teaching module for any Japan-related class in international business. Specifically, this publication reveals the inner workings of the Japanese business system. M&A activities covered here include those of foreign firms in Japan as well as Japanese firms investing domestically and in cross-border ventures. Illustrated by carefully chosen examples and supported by extensive data analyses, this book is highly recommended to readers who seek an in-depth understanding of the Japanese M&A market. The volume is enriched by case studies that explicitly illustrate the objectives of specific firms and how they successfully manage their M&A. The author brings to this work his 14 years of experience in Japan and has relied not only on English literature but also on original Japanese sources in creating this highly valuable contribution to the field.

Essays on mergers and financial markets
Cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) activity has experienced waves of popularity during the past fifty years. M&A plays an important role in today's business world. Yet, M&A activity has a relatively high failure rate which can be caused by many reasons, such as legitimacy and anti-monopoly. In fact, among these reasons, the human side of M&A is often ignored by managers, especially in phase of post-M&A. The objective of this thesis is to stress the importance of understanding what happens with managers and employees in the organization during the merger and acquisition process. Furthermore, the author will investigate what are the consequences of incomplete HR integration, and how to resolve these threats in order to achieve success in cross-border M&A. In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of cross-national M&A and importance of HR influence, literature study as the theoretical method and case study will be used. In case study, three unstructured interviews with WAHAHA general manager, technical director and sales manager who have extensive knowledge in this subject will be introduced. This research provides tenable results and suggestions on how to promote long-term development of HR in phase of post-M&A. This thesis found that there are three key elements that wield great influence on post M&A: corporate culture and identity, leadership and communication, and motivation and commitment. In conclusion, cultural marriage, leadership and management coordination, and effective communication help to achieve and measure HR integration in cross-border M&A. The target beneficiaries of this thesis include executives, managers and personnel who engage in cross-border M&A.

"Since Intelligent M&A was released in June 2007, the short and final chapter on How to survive a merger has received a lot of attention and the information provided therein appears to be robust enough to withstand that attention. Therefore, the proposed book will build on the organisation of that chapter and would be divided roughly into the following chapters: - Background on mergers and acquisitions: why companies merge and what happens to employees in those mergers - The first decision facing employees: stay or leave? - Attitude and personal performance - Timing issues: when to act? - Preparation during the pre-merger phase - Should you rely on your boss (and to what degree to 'trust' the company)? - The need to stay around the office - Taking care of your own team - Networking  internally and externally - Maintaining clients - The importance of flexibility in accepting new assignments - Preparing for the worst. Written in an engaging style, with real global case studies, this is an extremely valuable guide for any manager or employee concerned about their jobs when their companies are undergoing a corporate restructuring. (NB. The book is intended to be of use to readers globally. It therefore does not have a chapter on legal issues in being made redundant, as this information is out-dated quickly, isn't the expertise of the author and is available from experts elsewhere)"--Provided by publisher.
