The architect's office
Office buildings in Finland
Their canopy at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki propelled Finnish K2S Architects to well-deserved fame. They have followed that winning effort with projects characterised by strong design concepts, leading the functionalistic tradition of Finnish architecture into the 20th century. The Kamppi Chapel of Silence, which opened in Helsinki in 2012, has already become an iconic landmark of the Finnish capital. This book presents the wider scope of K2S' work, which proves that they're not only masters of grand gestures but can deftly handle a range of scales and challenges, from residential buildings, hospitals and schools, to the tiniest Finnish sauna.

Fresh : [the irresistible appeal of Gert Wingårdh's architecture
"The theme of Michael J. Crosbie's latest book for the Images Publishing Group is the architect's own office. As with most professions, first impressions are vital, so the design of an architect's own office can place his or her reputation on the line in a very public manner. Not only can clients assess a firm's style and capabilities based on the design of an architect's office but commissions can also be won or lost from that all-important initial representation. The projects within this book have been carefully chosen and reflect a variety of styles and trends. From historic old buildings shrouded in legend and lore to state-of-the-art modern chrome and steel structures, from the humble to the whimsical: the reader gets a glimpse of how each office aims to be a statement that highlights the skill and proficiency of the architects."--BOOK JACKET.

Eero Saarinen, of Finnish origin, became one of the leading American post-war architects, winning international acclaim for his sculptural buildings for TWA at Kennedy Airport in New York and Dulles Airport in Washington. Between 1948 and 1961 he was responsible for designing three of America's largest research and development centers for General Motors, IBM and Bell: companies that epitomized scientific progress, rapid technological development and intense interdisciplinary teamwork.
