Abstract: An amelioration of summer temperatures was a wery prominent feature in northern Finland from the beginning of this century until the 1930s. Since then, the climate has been deteriorating. This fluctuation is reflected in forestry practices. In the 1950s management plans and silvicultural instructions were based on experience gained during the favourable climatic period. When disappointments and failures followed in the 1960s, management programmes had to be revised and amended, and new, more conservative instructions issued.

This study was carried out in South Finland, in Hollola. The sample areas are situated in the middle of an open cut area. I took the samples in 1991 and 2009. Five species disappeared and five new species was observed. The species that increased the most are Discus ruderatus, Vitrina pellucida and Columella edentula. The variation in species of vascular plants has been noticeable. The moisture close to the soil surface is important to land snails, especially the remaining of ferns suffices for land snails.
