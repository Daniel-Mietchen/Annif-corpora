The world has moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy and further to a knowledge and information economy. Although the rapidity of the transition from one type of economy to the other varies from country to country, almost all economies have experienced these shifts to varying degrees. Countries such as India have simultaneously seen all three types of economies in operation, thereby increasing the complexity for top executives and others in the profession of management. The history of management bears evidence of the triumphs and travails associated with this transition from industrial economy to information/knowledge economy which has left many organizations dead and obsolete. Knowledge is a prized asset, which needs to be protected or shared for it to flourish or it will be forever lost. There is competitive advantage in knowledge and information, both for organizations and the executives that populate them.In this book, the author exploits these knowledge bases to study the role of leaders in knowledge management through an analysis of the collective experiences of successful executives of global corporations. This book draws on the author's research findings in the last decade in identifying and encapsulating various practical aspects of knowledge leadership that provide key tools for a broad range of executives of budding organizations.

This is a book that does what the title says, and is different from most business process mapping information in three key ways. First, it lets users capture all the knowledge that goes into a workflow in any kind of organization, including the most difficult kind of all, the tacit knowledge people bring to the job and carry in their heads. Second, it is simple, powerful, flexible, and easy to learn. Third, it does not require installing, learning, and applying a complicated program (sometimes requiring reorganization to support the software rather than the software supporting the organization). It was developed by the author in a fifteen-year long program of studying, analyzing, and improving avionics maintenance processes for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force, and then applied to organizations of all kinds ever since, for more than two decades. It has been taught and applied by the author and others in many short courses. It works.

'The normal enterprise, contrary to widespread prejudice, can do well out of intense knowledge, without bothering with snobbish high-tech delusions. In this respect, the present book deals with all the questions you might have been afraid to ask. It offers explanation, policy and practical conclusions in an international perspective. It is a compelling read!'--Arndt Sorge, Professor Emeritus, WZB, Germany. This book contributes to the discussion about the relevance of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship for industrial innovation in the context of traditional low-technology industries. There is a widespread assumption that low-tech industries offer limited opportunities for entrepreneurial activity due to their mature character. Yet there are indications that the phenomenon is finally emerging in these traditional sectors. This detailed book contributes to the ongoing political debate on relevant policy measures to promote future industrial innovation. It extends awareness of the relevance of low-tech industries for future economic and societal development, linking both scientific and political perspectives. Detailed chapters identify the typical patterns, prerequisites and impacts of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship, as well as the distribution of entrepreneurial activities in low-tech sectors. The authors conclude with policy recommendations to promote such activities. This book will appeal to social scientists, economists and students of innovation and entrepreneurship studies. Policy-makers and company representatives will also find much of interest in this book, with its surprising insights into a field that has been so far neglected in the scientific as well as the policy-oriented debate.

The aim of this thesis is to present a theoretically consistent conceptualization of knowledge creation as an interactive event and to test this in a working community in a methodologically coherent manner.This thesis examines the key problems in the body of research of knowledge creation in the field of Knowledge Management, which is attached to the idea of knowledge as an asset inside a human mind, but simultaneously promotes a view of interaction, based on hermeneutic understanding. The study proposes an alternative way to conceptualize and examine knowledge creation, based on hermeneutic phenomenology of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger. The foci are on the conceptions of a human being and interaction as play. On the basis of the research literature, a framework for examining knowledge creation was developed. The framework was empirically tested in a multi-organizational and multi-professional working community of librarians and teachers, participating in The Joy of Reading Program in Finland. Along with the research literature, the triangulated data consist of ethnographic observations and video recordings of the community's gatherings, its members' interviews and produced documents. The data were analyzed through a qualitative approach.The results show that the phenomenological conceptions of temporality of a human being and play are suitable for understanding being in the knowledge-creating interaction, as they give means to understand the meaningfulness of past experiences, but promote an open attitude towards future possibilities in a way which promotes knowledge creation. Studying interactive events allows for an understanding of how the phenomenon of knowledge creation can be examined as a collective accomplishment. The importance of flexible circumstances is emphasized to promote interaction. The playful mode of being in the event, meaning seriousness and the tendency to be present in the event, was seen as a way to use the time available effectively. The results may be utilized to develop organizational circumstances, which promote knowledge creation by acknowledging the meaningfulness of interaction.In the future, theoretical sampling will be used for testing and developing the framework further in a Finnish Academy's Strategic Research Council's consortium BCDC Energy aiming at developing a cloud computing based market place on renewable energy markets.

This study is a case assignment for Client A's dehydrated culinary products and the topic is Out-of-home food market analysis in Finland. The main objective of the study is to produce information and to transform it into knowledge and wisdom by analyzing the out-of-home food market in Finland. The topic arose as a request from Client A since there is a need for detailed market analysis about the out-of-home food market in Finland in order to increase market share and estimate a future business development strategy with the help of the outcome of the study. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate how international business practices can be developed on saturated, competitive markets with the help of market analysis, knowledge management, and strategic management as tools. This study consists of two main sections: a literature review and an empirical study. In the literature review relevant theories are discussed and applied to the market analysis. The literature review begins with a knowledge management approach, continues with theories about strategy, and how these interrelate with the production of market information and are essential in the production of a market analysis. The empirical study was conducted through qualitative data collection by six in-depth interviews and a precise analysis of these interviews. Based on the information obtained through the in-depth interviews and the theory, conclusions and recommendations were made. The findings revealed that since there is no common statistical databank for out-of-home food products, the analysis of an oligopolistic market is even more difficult. The findings also showed that the out-of-home food market in Finland is very end consumer oriented. In other words, wholesalers act in accordance to end consumers' needs and requirements, and the same attitude is expected from suppliers who must co-operate closely with customers and develop recipes according to the market's requirements. Organic food and close production are trends, but simultaneously the trade understands that not everything can be produced in Finland. Food additives should be minimized, and salt contents are expected to be kept as low as possible. Moreover, several product attributes such as packaging must be considered carefully. Price was regarded not to be the first decisive criteria. On the contrary, food safety, delivery reliability and correct labeling as well as multiple product usability were said to be more important. It is highly recommended for Client A to use a multinational approach with multi local attributes when conducting business on different markets. Since customers and consumers in Finland have certain requirements, Client A's products should be tailored to meet the individual market's needs. The findings of the study will be used to sharpen the presentation of the OOH culinary market in Finland to Client A's category management in near future. The findings, together with the already existing knowledge, will be used as background information when implementing a strategy in Finland and when developing local tactics.
