"By the writer whom Milan Kundera called Czechoslovakia's greatest contemporary writer comes a novel (now in English for the first time) peopled with eccentric, unforgettable inhabitants of a home for the elderly who reminisce about their lives and their changing country. Written with a keen eye for the absurd and sprinkled with dialogue that captures the poignancy of the everyday, this novel allows us into the mind of an elderly woman coming to terms with the passing of time"--

The Person provides psychologists with an organizational scheme for personality psychology. This sets the study of the person into evolutionary and cultural context and divided personality up into three broad areas: dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life stories. The fifth edition has been updated to reflect advances that have occurred in the field of psychology in the past few years. It presents new findings that have been obtained with respect to the correlates of personality traits, the dynamics of motives and goals in human lives, and the meanings and manifestations of life stories. Discussions are included on the new ideas on evolution and morality as well as the role of culture in personality. Psychologists will also find a much stronger and detailed discussion of psychophysiology of extraversion, neuroticism, and the train of sensation-seeking.
