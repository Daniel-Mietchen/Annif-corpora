Volume 1: Integrates more than 30 years of research by the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford to reveal how agricultural systems and wildlife interact, presenting examples from scales varying from microcosm to landscape, individuals to populations, and covering plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, with the purpose of fortifying the evidence base for managing outcomes. It considers the implications of agricultural development for natural habitats, biodiversity, and the provision of essential ecosystem services.

Provides a combination of selected case studies, combined with authoritative and thought-provoking editorial syntheses, to demonstrate how ecological study (often long term), combined with a flexible, interdisciplinary approach, is a consistently effective strategy to tackle the most pressing challenges facing farmers, conservationists, and policy makers today. It is aimed at student and professional academics as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers, both government and non-government.

In its first English-language edition, this book introduces the many-faceted interactions of animal populations with their habitats. From soil fauna, ants and termites to small and large herbivores, burrowing mammals and birds, the author presents a comprehensive analysis of animals and ecosystems that is as broad and varied as all nature. Chapter 2 addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems, emphasizing fluxes of energy and matter within and between ecosystems, and the effects of animals on qualitative and structural habitat change. Discussion includes chapters on the ro.
