"Comprehensive Behavior Management: Schoolwide, Classroom, and Individualized Approaches supports teachers in preventing management problems and responding to unwanted behavior when it occurs in classrooms. The text offers a comprehensive presentation of three levels of behavior management strategies: school-wide, classroom, and individual, all three of which contribute to a positive learning environment. A social learning emphasis, in which human behavior is viewed within an ecological framework, is integrated throughout the text. Application of this information is supported by a range of devices such as vignettes, examples, strategies, and activities to show teachers how to manage behavior effectively"--
