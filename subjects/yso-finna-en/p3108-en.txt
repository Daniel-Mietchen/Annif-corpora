reproductive rights
The right to life in European constitutional and international case-law
Sexual and reproductive well-being has gained recognition as a basic right, enshrined in international law. Yet reality on the ground is different, as society, health programmes and aid agencies are all entrenched in old ways. Fundamental shifts in thinking and practice are needed to realize these rights and transform these realities. This book portrays a wide range of innovative examples from around the world. From popular theatre in Nigeria to participatory research in Britain, from role-playing in Cambodia to visualizing reproductive health in Zimbabwe and from collaborative planning in Egypt to community dialogue in the Andes, these twenty four chapters reveal the value of transforming approaches to sexual reproductive well-being. All begin with the need to engage women, men and youth more directly in determining pathways to change; and all highlight both the complexities and the possibilities of making rights real.

This volume argues that legislation on abortion, adultery, and rape has been central to the formation of the modern citizen. The author draws on rights literature, bio-political scholarship, and a gender-studies perspective as a foundation for rethinking the sovereign relationship. In approaching the politicization of reproductive space from this direction, the study resituates the role of rights and rights-granting within the sovereign relationship. A second theme running throughout the book explores the international implications of these arguments and addresses the role of abortion, adultery and rape legislation in constructing 'civilizational' relationships. In focusing on the Ottoman Empire, Turkey, France and Italy as case studies, Miller presents a discussion of what 'Europe' is, and the role of sexuality and reproduction in defining it.
