Building bridges : some views on human spirituality
The Baha'i faith has some five million adherents around the world. It preaches the oneness of God, the unity of all faiths, universal education and the harmony of all people, but has no priesthood and few formal rituals. In this book Peter Smith traces the development of the Baha'i faith from its roots in the Babi movement of mid-nineteenth century Iran to its contemporary emergence as an expanding worldwide religion. * Explores the textual sources for Baha'i belief and practice, theology and anthropology and understanding of other religions. * Covers the concept of the spiritual path, Baha'i law and administration and aspects of community life. * Examines the Baha'i's social teachings and activities in the wider world. This introduction will be of particular interest to students of new religious movements, Middle East religions, and comparative religion and for those studying short courses on the Baha'i faith.
