Almost one hundred presentations from the 32nd annual Charleston Library Conference (held November 7-10, 2012) are included in this annual proceedings volume. Major themes of the meeting included alternative metrics for measuring impact, patron-driven acquisition, Open Access monographs, the future of university presses, and techniques for minimizing duplication and emphasizing the unique in library collections.
