"Preface Invasion is not a novel phenomenon; however, it is one that has increased tremendously during the past few years due to rapidly expanding trade and transport among countries. It is one of the most important impact humans have ever produced on the earth's ecosystems. In fact, it has led to globalization of world biota, further resulting in biotic homogenization. While some argue that invasion biologists should adopt a more objective and dispassionate stance towards invasive species, everyone agrees that it is a problem that needs attention and action. Recognizing that a deeper understanding of biological characteristics of invasive species and the ecological principles that underpin the invasion process is critical in formulating management decisions, the scientific community has dome an exemplary job in publishing original research as well as synthesis articles on the subject in recent years. Unfortunately, the science is still lagging behind, necessitating a reactive rather than a proactive response to the problem. The body of knowledge is growing so fast, including our ability to predict invasions. This will accelerate the science-based decision making, whether it is for reactive or proactive management or for developing effective public policies. The idea for this book began back in 2009 when the editors organized a regional IUFRO conference on invasive plants in Chandigarh, India. They met again in 2010 at the XXIII IUFOR World Congress in Seoul and finalized the plan for a book that would focus on invasive plant ecology. In addition to selected presentations from the IUFRO conference and the Congress, several prominent authors were invited to contribute chapters on specific topics. In the end, we accepted 18 chapters in the current volume"--

Plants interact with small organisms in their environment, such as bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, nematodes and insects. Some of these can cause diseases and pests whereas others can have a plant-beneficial action, such as (i) protecting plants against diseases, (ii) enhancing plant growth and productivity, (iii) reducing plant stresses caused by attackers, draught and salts, and (iv) cleaning soils from pollutants. Our understanding of plant-microbe interactions advances rapidly and the application of beneficial microbes in agriculture and horticulture - presently USD 1.7 billion annually - is increasing fast. Therefore, there is a strong need to present the principles of these interactions to a broad public. In this book, the basics of all interactions mentioned above are explained in an easily understandable way. Modern state-of-the-art technology on visualization of these interactions and on DNA techniques will be highlighted. Successful examples of progress are presented in the section Paradigms of Plant-Microbe Interactions. Finally, a number of innovative ongoing research projects will be presented. Presently, plants are mainly protected from diseases and pests by using agrochemicals. However, many of these chemicals pollute the environment and can be a health threat for animals and humans. This book show that microbes can help to reduce chemical input and can also be used in combination with chemicals, or even replace agrochemicals. It is generally accepted that the use of microbes will cause a breakthrough in agriculture and horticulture, making it more sustainable in a cost-effective way. Major chemical companies are buying microbial biotech companies. This book is aimed at everybody working in or interested in one of the many fields of plant-microbe interactions and who wants to become quickly familiar with (other) aspects of this broad field.

Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues
