The importance of Eco-Agriculture is getting more and more serious nowadays because of rapid world population growth. People need food to live. Energy and water are two important facts for every plant to grow and develop. Without energy and water no food can be produced. Energy and water resources are not fairly distributed in this planet. In some areas like the Middle East and African countries water if the limiting fact for producing food. This is in a way that these countries have lots of energy resources and sun-shine. In other side of the world the situation is totally different. In European countries for example, water is not a problem. They have enough water resources but energy and sunlight is not enough for plants to grow and produce food.   Producing food in closed water system could be a good solution for Eastern countries with less water resources. In a closed water recycling system, the water could be mechanically treated or filtered and reused. This system has no harm for environment and ground water resources. In this thesis one of the most efficient water recycling systems in form of Hydroponic method of growing plants will be introduced. This closed system however has some problems like algal growth prevention which is one of the main topics of this work.
