The objective of the thesis was to study the new alternative surface finishes for the printed wiring board. The results of the thesis will be used for the decision on the surface finish of the printes wiring boards for Nokia`s mobile phones. Technologies in soldering and in printed wiring board engineering are developing fast. The size of the high integration components is continously reduced. The solder areas of the components are very narrow. Sometimes too narrow solder areas result in the "black pad" phenomenon. One reason for this phenomenon can be the surface finish of the printed wiring board. This thesis proposes a basis for understanding the surface finishes of the printed wiring board and the surface finish properties that might affect printed wiring board manufacturing. A lot of effort was made to establish these properties. All available information was collected from potential finish suppliers and from other sources. The information was compared with to the manufacturing processes of surface finishes used by Nokia Mobile Phones. The correctness of the information was checked with the help of the literature and Nokia`s own information. The result of the thesis was a set of main criteria for the selection of surface finishes for the manufacturing process of mobile phone applications. This report is divided into two parts. The first part presents general theory of the pre-study of new surface finishes. This part of the work includes a short presentation of the related materials. The material selection criteria are also described at the beginning of the thesis. A lot of attention was focused on reliability, availability and environmtental considerations. The second part describes the test methods and the results of the tests. At the end of the thesis, a conclusion of the test results together with an approximation of the results. This study was begun in May 2001 and was completed within one year.

This Bachelor's thesis was commissioned by the Degree Programme in Information Technology in HAMK University of Applied Sciences. The aim of the study was to take a look at EMC Shielding, how it is applied and what different options there are for designers and manufacturers. This thesis also takes a look at EMC in general. In addition, it takes also discusses the EMC Directive currently in use in the EU and the requirements that need to be met before an electronic apparatus can be put into use. The main sources used for this thesis were relevant literature and also some documents found on the Internet.    The outcome of this thesis resulted in an information package that has useful knowledge about setting up EMC shielding in projects that involve electronics. Electromagnetic interference has become a serious challenge for circuit designers, and it will most likely become an even bigger problem in the future.
