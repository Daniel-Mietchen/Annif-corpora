The thesis studies current marketing conventions of international high-technology research laboratories in Europe and is done for the UNELMA-project. UNELMA is a joint project between Finnish and Swedish universities and institutions funded by the European Union, the Provincial Government of Norbotten, Lapin Liitto and Interreg IV A. The project wishes to create a network of professional services which will benefit companies in the Bothnian Arc between Finland and Sweden. The study itself intends to give possible examples of how high-technology professional services are marketed internationally and how to apply their practices to Finnish and Swedish high-technology marketing, the UNELMA-project's marketing in particular. Actual high-technology issues or operations in the respective field will not be discussed in this thesis. The knowledge base of the thesis relies on B2B-marketing, services marketing and digital marketing. The applied research method is benchmarking through case studies. Case studies were chosen as it was the best way of having information about the organizations the UNELMA-project and its managers were interested in. Recommendations of possible marketing practices and operations for UNELMA will be presented.

In a world moving towards services, driving service productivity is a central challenge for leaders and members of all types of organisations: for service businesses there is a clear need to be 'productive', but it is far less clear what this exactly means. In this book, we invite you on a journey that explores the ways, tools and options for driving service productivity. We take an innovator's perspectives and look at the tricky challenge of service productivity as a landscape of options for designing the future of services. Case examples, from the airport, hotel, healthcare, and professional service industry, offer insights in the methods used and approaches taken in business practice. Research results provide food for thought and valuable advice on the path towards superior service productivity. Throughout the book we also listen to the views and advices of interviewed experts from academia as well as business practice on how to drive service productivity. A forecast on how service productivity and service innovation might evolve in the future provides us - and hopefully you as a reader - with the necessary food for thought to develop our own understanding of driving service productivity in different business settings. Overall, this book is not a traditional 'academic product' that summarises the views of a few, but a co-created offering that profited enormously from the contributions of so many.

Professional business services : conceptual framework and a Swedish case study
The first objective of this study is to discover how Finnish companies, which are interested in investing to the UK, perceive the UK as a business location. Another objective is to research how the clients perceive the services of UKTI. The study is conducted for UK Trade & Investment (later UKTI). UK Trade & Investment is a government based promotion organization, which operates internationally and offers assistance for companies, which wish to trade with the UK. The theoretical framework is divided under two main issues: The foreign target market and service marketing. The foreign target market part concentrates on understanding different factors, which companies evaluate when they are trying to find a correct location to set up their business. Factors that relate on companies own strengths and abilities to expand abroad are set aside and the concentration is specifically in the UK factors. The service marketing part researches different aspects, which comprise the service in the minds of the customers. By knowing how customers observe these aspects, it is possible to get to know how customers evaluate the service, and understand which the service's strengths and weaknesses are. The analytical approach is deductive and the research method for collecting primary data was quantitative. Data was collected through a structured online questionnaire, which was sent to 77 UKTI's clients in March 2010. The questionnaire was open for three weeks. During this time two reminding emails were sent and phone calls were made to encourage clients answer. The potential respondent group was challenging, and 13 answers were received back. Thus, the response rate is 17%. The findings indicate the investors perceive the UK as a rather favourable business location. Businesses situate close to their customers in the UK, and the investors believe in the UK's growth potential and have confidence in their investments. The social and cultural environment attracts the Finnish investors, as well as the labour law. Investors seem to consider the UK as a stable legal environment, but the investors are not convinced about the economic stability. Operating costs and productivity are the least favourable factors in the market. Respondents have evaluated communications and technology, transport infrastructure, and level of research and development relatively low. Responsiveness, reliability and assurance are the most significant dimensions for clients in UKTI's services, and clients evaluate UKTI's services good, especially in these factors. UKTI should contact their past clients and keep contact with their current clients also in the future, as 85% of the respondents consider they would like to receive information from UKTI in the future.

In this thesis the market of branding services in St. Petersburg is explored in a Business-to-Business context. The study looks into the current situation on the market, which changed significantly because of the global finance crisis. Based on theoretical findings, a qualitative study was conducted by means of interviews with experts, brand managers and brand theorists. The key issues of the questionnaire were: the structure of the branding services market, the market̕s specifics and problems, its main tendencies, and the forecast for the market of branding services in St. Petersburg. The secondary data about branding companies and range of its services was collected via the Internet and analyzed.   The global financial crisis has decreased the demand on branding services. On the other hand, the influence of the crisis is seen as a positive development for the market. The market is expected to improve the quality of providing services. Most importantly, competence in field of branding expected to grow. Russian citizens and enterprises still are not fully aware about benefits of the brand concept. According to research results, St. Petersburg̕ branding services market has a promising future because of its huge potential to grow and develop.

The thesis is provided to help small startup-companies to learn basic factors of international customer service. It does not have any specific commissioner but a company of any field of business is welcome to take advantage of it. The objective of the thesis was to make an international customer service guide with the most general perspective as possible and to include the most important matters according to international customer service into the same guide. Source materials are used as references and these materials were the basis of the research. Books (i.e. Järvinen, R; Rosti, P; Ylikoski, T; 2002. Hyvä asiakaspalvelu-menestystekijä finanssialalla) and articles (e.g. Business and industry portal; Service and selling strategies at the time of sale) had a major role in the results of a research of this kind. The main findings of the thesis are that a functional customer service is a necessary part of any kind of business, qualitative customer service requires expertise and that cultural factors have an impact on international customer service. This thesis can be continued by another author in the future. The next step for it would be to consider a specific culture and a startup-company and to find solutions for the company’s main problems according to international customer service.^
