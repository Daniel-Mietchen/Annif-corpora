art therapy
Life has a way of throwing unexpected obstacles in our path. Your personal anxieties can build up and seem overwhelming. Help is at hand. Master artist Jean Haines leads you on a journey through paint, showing how you can wipe away your worries with the soothing and gentle movement of watercolour on paper. Meditative, peaceful and calming, watercolour painting offers relief and solace to everyone, with no judgement or goal beyond itself. This book shows you the many ways painting can calm your life, and empower you so you have control over stress or boredom.

Puppetry in dementia care : connecting through creativity and joy
"The subjects of this book belong to a population that is marginalized and isolated. They are children and adults with disabilities--artists who make art in special classrooms, prisons, rural back roads, backwaters, and institutions. By focusing on this population, editor and key author Alice Wexler provides a common thread that unites traditionally separate fields of art criticism, art education, and art therapy. With firsthand experience in the field, each contributor to this volume offers critical research which challenges the non-transferable divide between us and them, encouraging art teachers, therapists, critics, and general readers alike to uncover their biases regarding the nature of art and education.

Art as an early intervention tool for children with autism
"This compendium engages art critics, art educators, and art therapist in a conversation about artists with disabilities in non-traditional settings. For the sake of clarity, this population is subsumed under the term "Outsider."The idiosyncratic, often passionate and self-taught nature of "Outsider" art has captured the interest of the members of these fields, posing provocative questions about the social order and its inherent exclusion. What the authors hope to arrive at is not further division, but rather a continuum suitable for the human condition"--
