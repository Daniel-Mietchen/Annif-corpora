The customer of this project is Dometalot Ltd company. It is a Finnish construction company specialized in the creating and building of individual passive houses. The type of this thesis is research task. The goal of this research is to measure and comparethe sound insulation characteristics of different types of Dometalotâ€™s wall structures and one basic wall structure. The research in this thesis is divided into two parts. The first of them is an analysis of standards by the International Organization for Standardization. The description and analysis of the research is presented in the second part of this thesis. The method of measurement of airborne sound insulation of internal wall is the consistent measurement and comparison of the average sound pressure level on the premises.The main used materials are standards ISO 10140. The drawings of the walls were created with AutoCAD program. The company can use the results of the research in the future to improve their wall structures.
