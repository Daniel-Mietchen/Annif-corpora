Abstract: Deploying an open source router. At the center of every network there is a router and a router is used to connect one network to another network. So a router has the responsibility of routing packets across different networks. The networks where this traffic is routed can either be located within the same proximity as that of the router or it can be miles away, for instance in another country. The aim of this project was to deploy an open source router and then customize it to carry out the exact role of commercial routers, which is to route traffic between networks. Various IP routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF were tested and in order to carry out this, a small local area network comprising of two routers and two PCs were designed. In order to experiment with this project various software and devices were needed. Some of the software needed to be downloaded and installed onto four PCs, two PCs of which were installed with an open source routing router (Quagga) and the operating system running on the PCs was the  Ubuntu Server 11.10 Server edition. The issue of compatibility between the operating system and  open-source routing router was the key point as to why Quagga and Ubuntu 11.10 server edition were chosen. The same deployment can be fully implemented by small startup companies when designing their networks. The outcome of the project showed that an open-source routing routers can be installed, configured and customized to carry out the intended purpose in a network, that is to route traffic between networks. In addition to that IP routing protocols (OSPF, RIP) worked well as expected though few problems for instance, RIPv1 worked well as compared to RIPv2 which had some shortcoming in terms of security. However the general goal of routing packets via open-source routing router (Quagga) was achieved and such project can be implemented in small companies.

This thesis was part of a development program coordinated by the Finnish Defense Forces. This program includes several development projects for military communication systems.    The purpose of this thesis was to examine precise oscillators for ensuring the synchronization of communication systems. General oscillator techniques and theory were studied. This thesis deals with the oscillator technologies and the implementation of precise oscillator prototype.    The main design targets of the oscillator unit were high accuracy, compatibility with a tactical router, small size and usability. The oscillator unit can be used with a tactical router or as a stand-alone precise clock source. The prototype of an oscillator unit was planned, developed and tested in this project.    The oscillator unit includes a GPS synchronized precise atomic clock, a microcontroller, control logic and interface circuits. The oscillator unit has also interfaces for oscillator control and testing.    The chip scale atomic clock is a precise timing source. GPS system is the main timing source of the router. The oscillator acts as a secondary timing source of the tactical router. Further development ideas were presented in order to increase the performance of the oscillator unit. Key words: tactical router, oscillator, synchronization, timing.
