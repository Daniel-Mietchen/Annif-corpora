The Person provides psychologists with an organizational scheme for personality psychology. This sets the study of the person into evolutionary and cultural context and divided personality up into three broad areas: dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life stories. The fifth edition has been updated to reflect advances that have occurred in the field of psychology in the past few years. It presents new findings that have been obtained with respect to the correlates of personality traits, the dynamics of motives and goals in human lives, and the meanings and manifestations of life stories. Discussions are included on the new ideas on evolution and morality as well as the role of culture in personality. Psychologists will also find a much stronger and detailed discussion of psychophysiology of extraversion, neuroticism, and the train of sensation-seeking.

Grammar from the human perspective : case, space and person in Finnish
The task of understanding human beings, what we ourselves are, our constitution and condition, is a perennial problem in philosophy and related disciplines. Smith argues here that our understanding of human persons is threatened by technological development and capricious academic theories alike, seeking to deny or relativize the personhood of humanity. Smith's book puts a stake in the ground, in defense of a view of the human that is genuinely humanistic in the traditional sense and capable of sustaining with intellectual coherence things like modern human rights and universal benevolence.

"What is a person? Surprisingly little attention is given to this question in psychology. For much of the past century, psychology has tended to focus on the systematic study of processes rather than on the persons who enact and embody them. In contrast to the reductionist picture of much mainstream theorizing, which construes persons as their mental lives, behaviours or neurophysiological particulars, The Psychology of Personhood presents persons as irreducibly embodied and socially situated beings. Placing the study of persons at the centre of psychology, this book presents novel insights on the typical, everyday actions and experiences of persons in relation to each other and to the broader society and culture. Leading scholars from diverse academic disciplines paint an integrative portrait of the psychological person within evolutionary, historical, cultural, developmental and everyday contexts"--
