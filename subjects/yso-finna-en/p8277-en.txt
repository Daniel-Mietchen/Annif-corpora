Provides exhaustive coverage of cement grouting in rock foundations, outlining all types of cement grout, comparing their suitabilities and describing various ways cement grouting is used in engineering construction. Written and arranged in an easy-to-read manner, the book is arranged as a reference manual with numerous cross-references. Step-by-step explanations on grouting techniques are given in considerable detail and written with both the novice and experienced practitioner in mind. Also covers advanced technology, including the current state of computer use in grouting operations; the latest grouting materials such as microfine; and the use of superplasticizers in cement grout. Chapters are arranged from elementary to advanced technology.

Geotechnical aspects of building on expansive soils in Kibaha, Tanzania
"Given the recent advances in site investigation techniques, computing, access to information and monitoring, plus the current emphasis on safety, accountability and sustainability, the intention of this book is to introduce an up-to-date methodology for the design of all types of rock engineering projects, whether surface or underground. Guidance is provided on the nature of the modeling to support design and the information required for design; also included is a procedure for technical auditing the modeling and design together with the related protocol sheets. This modern approach to Rock Engineering Design includes a CD-ROM with protocol sheets. Written by two eminent authors, clearly structured and with many illustrations, this volume is intended for consulting engineers, contractors, researchers, lecturers and students work on rock engineering projects"--
