reading research
The second edition of this highly successful anthology makes available to the feminist reader a collection of essays which does justice to the range and diversity, as well as to the eloquence and the challenge of recent feminist critical theory and practice. The new, enlarged Feminist Reader includes Toni Morrison's brilliant discussion of a Hemingway short story, Line Pouchard's reading of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian classic, The Well of Loneliness, Marjorie Garber on Elvis and cross-dressing, and Diane Elam on the relation between feminist and postmodernism, in addition to a selection of influential essays by prominent feminist critics and theorists. The book arose directly from the editors' experience of teaching feminist criticism, and their sense of the need for a fully annotated, representative selection of essays for discussion. They have included a summary of each essay, a glossary of unfamiliar terms, new suggestions for further reading and an updated introduction, mapping the field of feminist critical theory.

"Gendering the Reader" is a collection of essays which aims to explore the relationship between gender and reading/interpretation. Rather than accepting a simple argument that women interpret texts differently, the contributors to this volume are concerned to explore the way that gender does and does not make a difference in a wide variety of interpretive contexts - in film, literature, TV, art, pop-songs, advertisements and magazines. The book presents a cogent synthesis of current research across the fields of film theory, cultural studies, media analysis, literary theory and sociology. "Gendering the Reader" poses important questions not only about the reading/viewing/hearing process, but also about the nature of gender differences.
Basso Magazine is a music magazine published by the Helsinki-based media company Oy Basso Media Ltd. The magazine covers in its articles both domestic and foreign artists and bands in the field of urban music. In addition, the magazine also consists of articles about fashion and art. This thesis presents the research process and the results of a Basso Magazine reader survey. At the time of the research, the magazine had been published since 2006, with six issues per year. The thesis was commissioned in spring 2009. The aim of the reader survey was to find out subscribers' and single issue buyers' opinions on the content of the magazine. In addition, readers were asked to share their new ideas and improvement suggestions for the magazine's developmental purposes. The company had not previously implemented this type of reader survey. The reader survey was conducted as a web-based questionnaire in late spring 2009. It consisted of both structured and open questions. The questions were divided into different categories. The responses of the questionnaire were analyzed and based on the responses charts and figures were drawn up, forming the basis of the analysis chapter. The most frequent themes, which emerged from the open answers, were also analyzed in the same chapter. On the basis of the responses readers of the magazine were satisfied with the visual style and the layout of it. Feedback of the content was more critical, however. The readers wanted more clear structure and in-depth focus on the journalistic views of the articles. The research study showed that Basso Magazine has an active and conscious readership and they are willing to take part in the development of the magazine in the future.

LITERATURE AND THE BRAIN goes straight to the human core of literature when it explains the different ways our brains convert stories, poems, plays, and films into pleasure. When we are deep into a film or book, we find ourselves absorbed, unaware of our bodies or our surroundings. We don't doubt the existence of Spider-Man or Harry Potter, and we have real feelings about these purely imaginary beings. Our brains are behaving oddly, because we know we cannot act to change what we are seeing. This is only one of the special ways our brains behave to with literature, ways that LITERATURE AND THE BRAIN reveals.
