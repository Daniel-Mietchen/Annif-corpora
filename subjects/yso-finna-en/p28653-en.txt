Mad men unbuttoned : a romp through 1960s America
In just a few years, what used to be an immobile piece of living room furniture, which one had to sit in front of at appointed times in order to watch sponsored programming on a finite number of channels, morphed into a glowing cloud of screens with access to a near-endless supply of content available when and how viewers want it. With this phenomenon now a common cultural theme, a writer of David Thomson's stature delivering a critical history, or biography of the six-decade television era, will be a significant event which could not be more timely. Over twenty-two thematically organized chapters, Thomson brings provocatively insightful and unique to the life of what was television

Depictions of the ancient world on the stage and in art have always competed with a scholarly approach to the reconstruction of the past. The rise of cinema and television has heightened the difficulty in distinguishing between 'elite' and 'popular' culture. On American TV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has incorporated aspects of the classical within the high school horror genre. In art cinema, the films of Theo Angelopoulos seek to reclaim Greek myth from academia and claim its recognition as part of a living modern culture. Alexander the Great has been recreated in an animated Japanese television series, not as the western conqueror who spread Hellenistic values through Asia, but as a figure of destruction and renewal. Heroic male values may be reasserted in cinema as part of a conservative agenda that relies on the cultural capital of the past, or subjected to humorous critique or feminist reinterpretation in TV series such as Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess.

Broadcast communication has had a profound effect on modern society in the 20th and early 21st centuries. A growing international field of research has examined the historical development of broadcasting within various social and historical contexts, but also has made significant contributions to the understanding of media communication in general. Central topics in this discussion concern the relationships between technological innovations, institutional arrangements, social relations and culture. This book analyses the historical developments of Swedish broadcasting from the introduction of radio in the mid-1920s until the early 2000s. In relation to international research, it explores key aspects of how broadcast media emerged as a way to communicate over distance, connected to audiences, and evolved into central institutions and socio-cultural universes in society. The chapters are arranged in five thematic sections focusing on the invention and early development of radio and television, audience orientation, professional practices, broadcast genres, and institutional changes. The book derives from a large-scale research programme on Swedish broadcast history comprising about 50 studies and led by the “Swedish Foundation of Broadcast Media History”. --Publisher's description.

"Exploring television at once as a technological medium, an economic system, a facet of democracy, and a part of everyday life, this landmark text uses numerous case studies to demonstrate the past, immediate, and far-reaching effects of American culture on television - and television's influence on American culture. Arranged topically, the book provides a broad historical overview of television while also honing in on such finer points as the formal attributes of its various genres and its role in gender and racial identity formation." "Replete with examples, this pedagogically rich text includes many end-of-chapter case studies and narratives with suggestions for further reading - and, appropriately, viewing. Illustrations and photographs - primarily DVD grabs - contextualize historical footage and older television programs that may not be familiar to younger students."--Jacket.
