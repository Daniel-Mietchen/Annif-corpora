Introduction to embryonic development
The greatest mystery of life is how a single fertilized egg develops into a fully functioning, sometimes conscious multicellular organism. This title offers a theory of how embryos build themselves, and combines simple physics with the biochemical and genetic breakthroughs, based on their discovery of differentiation waves.
