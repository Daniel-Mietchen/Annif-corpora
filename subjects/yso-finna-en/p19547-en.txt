Taxation, Employment and the Environment : General Equilibrium Analysis with Unionised Labour Markets
Tourism has demonstrated its potential as a huge driving force in the economic growth and development of Lagos State as a whole. The Eyo festival, particularly celebrated in Lagos, is one among the many events that pulls tourists to Lagos. This cultural festival not only enriches the state, but every segment of the host communities, as benefits from tourism have spiral effects. The purpose of this bachelor's thesis was to find out the economic impact of Eyo festival on Lagos State, how the festival has contributed to the economical growth of the state and the indirect effects of the festival in contributing to wages and employment in other local businesses that supply goods and services to the overall tourism business in Lagos. This thesis was conducted based on literature review by reviewing, analyzing and authenticating the projects and reports already written on similar topic and projects. Tourism textbooks, journals, internet sources and internet reports were the secondary sources reviewed. The data used in this study are secondary in nature and the empirical data were obtained by using a questionnaire based on responses from respondents. From all these, an analysis was done. The results show a positive correlation between the Eyo festival and other tourism related activities and the increase in the economic growth in the state.
