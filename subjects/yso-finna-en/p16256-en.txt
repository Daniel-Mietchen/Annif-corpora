During the last decade, the issue of migration has increased in global prominence and has caused controversy among the host countries around the world.

This edition also features new essays by a demographer, geographer, and sociologist.
European Union law
Still crazy after all these years : women, writing & psychoanalysis
"How should we, citizens of rich countries, respond to the claims of the many millions of people world-wide who want to immigrate and settle in our societies? Their reasons are often compelling - they are fleeing mass poverty or political persecution - but the impact that fully open borders would have on the life of the societies that the immigrants would join is also immense. This books defends democratic states' rights to control their borders, and powerfully criticizes the arguments offered in support of international freedom of movement - common ownership of the earth, global equality of opportunity, and the human right to immigrate. It explains why states have rights over territory that permit them to exclude outsiders, and why democracies are entitled to decide who they will accept as future citizens. But it also sets out the parameters of a just immigration policy."--Provided by publisher.
