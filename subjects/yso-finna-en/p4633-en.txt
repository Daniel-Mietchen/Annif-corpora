The prime objective for writing this thesis was to introduce the concept of modern logistics and to survey both the elements of modern logistics management and specific example that can be helpful in fully understanding such a management in practical application. The well-known management guru Peter Drucker once described logistics as the last profit frontier. As a result, in business, either manufacturing or merchandising, should be of comprehension to the essentials of logistics management to build and manage an efficient logistics system. Retailer giant Wal-Mart, as one of the world's top 500 enterprises, has been holding a position of prestige in the global procurement market. Moreover, Wal-Mart attributes its success to the application of logistics modernization. Clearly, Wal-Mart has been aware that managing the entire modern logistics procedure – from procurement, transportation, distribution, to supply chain and customer service is crucial to maximize profits and minimize costs.
