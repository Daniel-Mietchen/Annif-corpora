"Philosophical Delusion and its Therapy" develops a novel account of the nature and genesis of philosophical problems. This account vindicates a revolutionary reorientation of philosophical work: the project of philosophical therapy pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein. With the help of concepts adapted from different branches of cognitive science (cognitive linguistics, cognitive and clinical psychology), the book explains where and why therapy is called for in philosophy, and develops techniques to actually carry it out.

How to read texts : a student guide to critical approaches and skills
With the imagery of a poet and the reflection of a philosopher, David Whyte turns his attention to 52 ordinary words, each its own particular doorway into the underlying currents of human life. Beginning with Alone and closing with Work, each chapter is a meditation on meaning and context, an invitation to shift and broaden our perspectives on the inevitable vicissitudes of life: pain and joy, honesty and anger, confession and vulnerability, the experience of feeling besieged and the desire to run away from it all. Through this lens, procrastination may be a necessary ripening; hiding an act of freedom; and shyness the appropriate confusion and helplessness that accompanies the first stage of revelation. Consolations invites readers into a poetic and thoughtful consideration of words whose meaning and interpretation influence the paths we choose and the way we traverse them throughout our lives.

What are the limitations of computer models and why do we still not have working models of people that are recognizably human?Â This is the principle puzzle explored in this book where ideas behind systems that behave intelligently are described and different philosophical issues are touched upon.Â The key to human behaviour is taken to be intelligence and the ability to reason about the world To approach this scientifically, it is necessary to understand what a scientific approach could mean in the context of both natural and artificial systems.Â A theory of intelligence is proposed that can be tested and developed in the light of experimental results.Â The author illustrates that intelligence is much more than just behaviour confined to a unique person or a single computer program within a fixed time frame.Â Some answers are unravelled and some puzzles emerge from these investigations and experiments.Â Natural and Artificial Reasoning describes a few steps on an exciting journey that began many centuries ago with the word âwhy?â

Remarks on cognition in Spinoza: understanding, sensation, and belief
This book presents an innovative and novel approach to linguistic semantics, beginning with the idea that language can be described as a system for the expression of linguistic Meanings as particular surface forms or Texts. Semantics is specifically that system of rules that ensures a correct transition from a Semantic Representation of the Meaning of a family of synonymous sentences to the Deep Syntactic Representation of a particular sentence. Framed in the terms of Meaning-Text linguistics, this volume discusses in detail the problems of Semantic Representation —including the semantic structure of utterances, the semantics of Causation in English, and communicative, or information, structure. Based on the author's life-long dedication to the study of the semantics and syntax of natural language, this book is a paradigm-shifting contribution to the language sciences whose originality and daring will make it essential reading for linguists, anthropologists, semioticians, and computational linguists.

"How reliable is our intuition? How much should we depend on gut-level instinct rather than rational analysis when we play the stock market, choose a mate, hire an employee, or assess our own abilities? In this engaging and accessible book, David G. Myers shows us that while intuition can provide us with useful - and often amazing - insights, it can also dangerously mislead us."--BOOK JACKET.

The origins of the number concept
"Have you ever had the feeling that you're just not getting through to the person you're talking with, or coming across the way you intend to? You're not alone. Our usual approach is to just talk louder, to try harder to get our message through. This is almost always the wrong approach. Why? Because other people almost never see us the way we see ourselves. Fortunately, these distortions in perception are systematic, understandable, and surmountable. Heidi Grant Halvorson, bestselling author of Nine Things Successful People Do Differently and Focus, now shows you how to communicate effectively-despite these unintentional (yet widespread) distortions of perception. By better understanding how communication and perception really work, you'll learn to send the right signals at the right time, no matter who you're communicating with"--
