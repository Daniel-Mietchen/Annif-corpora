codicology
Medieval music in practice : studies in honor of Richard Crocker
This book unites six essays related to manuscript culture in Britain. The main emphasis is on the physical appearance of books. The essays highlight, in different ways, the tight relationship between the paleographical and codicological features of manuscripts and the culture in which the objects were produced and used. Extending their expertise to a broad audience interested in the medieval book, the contributors discuss various aspects of written culture, including the development of Insular scripts, book culture in Mercia, the layout of Anglo-Saxon charters, and the transition from Anglo-Saxon to Norman inspired script and book production.
The calligraphy of medieval music
The awakener of sleeping men : inquisitor Petrus Zwicker, the Waldenses, and the retheologisation of heresy in late medieval Germany
The world of Byzantine manuscripts is fascinating but also confusing. Although they play an important part in modern studies on the history of Christian liturgy and on the textual history of the Bible, a clear overview of the vast amount of these manuscripts in their many different forms is lacking. A new approach in their cataloguing is called for. The present volume brings together a number of specialists in the field of Byzantine, liturgical and Biblical studies with the aim to develop a new methodology for codicological research of the Byzantine manuscripts, taking seriously the original environment of the integral codices in the monasteries and the churches in which they were manufactured and functioned.
