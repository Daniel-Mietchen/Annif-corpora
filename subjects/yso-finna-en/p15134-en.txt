Introduction to materials chemistry
Inorganic materials
"This book gives readers a broad overview of how the fundamentals of chemistry are used to create sophisticated materials and devices that improve modern life. This is an ideal text for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in chemistry, materials science, and chemical engineering. It also provides a general overview for professionals in research and/or industry, illustrating the relationships between different types of solids and how combinations of different materials are often used to solve challenging technical problems."--Jacket.
