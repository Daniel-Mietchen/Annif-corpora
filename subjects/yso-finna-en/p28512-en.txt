Is it possible to have great tasting gluten-free foods? Yes, with the secret of coconut flour. Coconut flour is made from dried coconut that has been ground into a powder. It looks and feels just like any other flour, but unlike wheat flour, it is completely gluten-free. It is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals and contains about the same amount of protein as whole wheat. It is a good source of calorie-free dietary fibre that is so important for good digestive health. The best part is that it tastes fantastic! Using the basic yeast dough recipe described in this book, you will be able to make gluten-free yeast breads that will remind you of your mothers home-made baked bread. Yet these recipes are easier and quicker to make. With coconut flour and a few other key ingredients, you can make gourmet dinner rolls, sandwich bread, pizza crust, calzones, hamburger and hot dog buns, breadsticks, scones, tortillas, and a variety of artisan breads. The recipes in this book are designed to appeal to a wide range of tastes. For breakfast you will find a variety of sweet and savoury muffins, pancakes, and waffles.
