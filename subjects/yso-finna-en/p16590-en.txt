Challenges of ordinary democracy : a case study in deliberation and dissent
In this text, university teachers from Eastern Europe, Western Europe and North America report on their efforts to prepare students for engaged democratic citizenship. Their case studies illustrate methods employed to prepare citizens for meaningful participation in democracies, whether long-standing, young or emerging. The contributors describe their approaches in detail, reflecting on the philosophical and pedagogical considerations being employed, as well as exploring models of experiential service-learning, action research, and other curricular innovations. Stakeholders are encouraged to replicate, modify or entirely recast the ideas presented, in the interest of building capacity within their institutions, peers and partners to realize and maintain the promise of democracy.
