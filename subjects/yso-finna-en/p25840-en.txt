What Really Works in Special and Inclusive Education presents special educational needs teachers with a range of evidence-based strategies they can immediately put into practice in their classrooms. This unique book will be invaluable to any teacher in the field with neither the time nor the inclination to engage with theory-heavy research, but with a desire to ensure that their teaching strategies are up-to-the-minute and proven to be the most effective best practices. Each of the 26 strategies that this book comprises has a substantial research base, a strong theoretical rationale and clear guidelines on their implementation, as well as cautionary advice where necessary. In this new second edition, David Mitchell, a leading writer in special and inclusive education, continues to break new ground with revised and updated strategies based on evidence from the most recent studies in the field. From the myriad of related research available, only those studies with genuine potential for improving the practices of teachers and schools have been included, with the aim of facilitating practitioners in providing high-quality learning and social outcomes for all. Updates to this new edition include: An even wider international focus, including evidence drawn from the Far East New chapters on Response to Intervention, School-wide strategies, and the Finnish Education System A new companion website, with extra case studies and links to further reading, journal articles and video For anyone with a vocational or academic interest in evidence-based special educational needs teaching strategies – whether student or qualified classroom teacher, teacher trainer, educational psychologist, special needs coordinator, consultant or researcher – this book will be essential reading.
An educational psychology of classroom management
Organizing for learning in the primary classroom : a balanced approach to classroom management
Dynamic Assessment (DA) reconceptualizes classroom interactions by arguing that teaching and assessment should not be distinct undertakings but must be integrated as a single activity that seeks to understand learner abilities by actively supporting their ongoing development. DA is based in the Vygotskian notion of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) which captures the uniquely human potential to exceed our present capabilities by working in cooperation with others whose dialogic interaction mediates us to higher levels of functioning. DA offers a framework for co-constructing a ZPD with learners in order to simultaneously reveal the full range of their abilities and promote development. This book presents the first in-depth analysis of DAa (TM)s application to particular problems of L2 development. It includes detailed discussions of the core theoretical tenets as well as guidelines for implementing DA principles in L2 classrooms. The book will be of interest to language teacher educators, language testers, classroom practitioners, and students and researchers in the areas of SLA, language pedagogy, and assessment.

Teacher Language and Student Learning enables teachers to observe their actions and ask, "Do I know how children perceive my behaviors?" It also helps them to understand reasons for children's responses to their words and actions. Teachers' behaviors are categorized in vignettes, and readers determine where they fit and what changes ought to be made for their teaching practices to be more effective.

The primary objective of the present paper is to discuss and analyse the use of humor in the context  of multicultural classroom. This primarily theoretical discussion also attempts to gain a more  comprehensive understanding of how humor can be employed in teaching and instruction thus  contributing to learning. Fundamentally, the intention is to determine dimensions of appropriate and  benevolent humor in terms of learning. The questions to be considered in this paper are as follows: 1)  what the humor is like in classroom, and 2) why humor used in classroom is regarded appropriate or  inappropriate. For this paper, humor in classroom is studied in the light of topic related literature.  Humor as a complex form of communication is discussed here by reviewing a number of academic  publications on the topic. Furthermore, the two pivotal concepts of humor and culture are discussed  briefly. This theoretical overview is also supplemented by a few student interviews from culturally  and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The present paper focuses mainly on the theoretical aspects  of classroom humor and humor as a pedagogical tool. Through this mainly theoretically oriented  study, our aim is to identify some of those features which could potentially contribute to the use of  appropriate humor as derived from the Instructional Humor Processing Theory (IHPT) and previous  research findings. In conclusion, this study offers some viewpoints on humorous features relevant to  promoting an inspiring learning experience.
