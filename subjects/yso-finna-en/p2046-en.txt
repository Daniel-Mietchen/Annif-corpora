The study was conducted as a comprehensive overview of Reporting Formalities Directive and its' implementation in Finland, threats and opportunities from Customs point of view. National Single Window concept is just a phase towards the integra-tion of maritime surveillance. This approach towards further integration of maritime surveillance was confirmed in the roadmap for the development of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR), which foresees the creation of a common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) for the European maritime domain. One aim is also to enhance co-operation between civil and military authorities.  The integrated maritime surveillance is to generate situational awareness of activities at sea impacting on maritime safety and security (ISPS), border control, the maritime environment, fisheries control, trade and economic interests within the European Union.  There has already been for decades a demand for a single window concept already decades and many implementations are already in practice. It has, however become more evident that the preliminary purpose was to create a working service platform. The technological part has considered by many to be the issue, nevertheless, it has become more and more obvious that the real issue are the co-operation, different cultures, different processes involved, legislations and other different approaches to this concept.  Conclusions based on this study showed us that building up the structures of a Single window system are not facing only technical, cultural or legal problems but as well some basic changes towards our attitudes for closer cooperation has to be reconsidered.  There will be a project going on to build up Common Information Sharing Environment, where surveillance is coming more in focus. There will also be military authorities involved with the NSW plans to do more cooperation in maritime surveillance matters (EUCISE2020). This next project will be a very fruitful study topic for someone as well the satisfaction of current and new stakeholders then.
