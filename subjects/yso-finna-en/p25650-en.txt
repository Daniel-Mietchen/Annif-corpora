Continuous deliveries, the topic of this thesis, cover the supply chain model of the case company Atea Finland Oy. The scope of the research is limited to the order-delivery chain, thus omitting supply chain processes after the point of delivery. There are two reasons for this delimitation. The scope of the whole project is too vast for the topic to be analyzed carefully in a Bachelor's thesis. The process of re-examining the supply chain model is ongoing and the areas that are analyzed in this thesis highlight this at this stage of the project. The objectives consist of describing the current state analysis of continuous deliveries, finding real life challenges from within the basic model, finding out whether the de-scription of the supply chain process model needs to be redesigned and, finally, reflect-ing on the findings against customer satisfaction. Conclusions consist of a list of challenges in the scope of the continuous deliveries that emerged from six interviews with the company personnel in key positions of the supply chain. In addition, the results are analyzed from research question perspectives. The list of challenges are gathered from sub-topic areas consisting of availability and requirements of mandatory information, responsibilities, internal information flow, information flow to customers and continuous development of the processes. As a result the challenges contribute to the development of the processes.

The commissioner of this thesis is a company called CubiCasa. The reason for this thesis was the interest of CubiCasa on 3 different segments. The segments were AR/VR, home decoration and real estate business. The commissioner wanted to find out if it is profitable for the company to go and target these different segments. On these segments they also defined 4 different companies: InsiteVR, Augmented Pixels, CoContest and Zillow. Of these companies they wanted more information and if they should go and sell their products to them. Most of the used material were from the internet sources. Theory part of this thesis were gathered from books. Most of the segments were found to not be profitable for CubiCasa to sell their products to at this time. The company operating in real estate business, Zillow, is the most relevant ones from these companies and segments because of the technology of CubiCasa and their production process. But even in the case of Zillow CubiCasa still have to wait until they have managed to create an almost fully automated production process on the floor plans.
Strategic sales process adaptation : relationship orientation of the sales process in a business-to-business context
The study of the business of opera has taken on new importance in the present harsh economic climate for the arts. This book presents research that sheds new light on a range of different aspects concerning marketing, audience development, promotion, arts administration and the economic issues that beset opera professionals. The aim of the editors has been to put together a collection of essays that forms a coherent whole by engaging with a single theme (business), although these essays differ in their particular choice of topic and critical perspective. The essays bring the study of opera up to the twenty-first century, and are distinguished by their concern with the business of opera here and now in a globalized market. That means newly commissioned opera, sponsorship, state funding for opera and the production and marketing of historic opera in the twenty-first century.

Abstract: Global account management : the art of managing international key accounts. This bachelor thesis aims at analyzing Global Account Management as an instrument for handling global business-to-business relationships between supplier and buyer. The challenges and critical success factors within Global Account Management should underline the complexity of global deals between global corporations. A deeper inside into the organizational structures identifies the background of the obstacles for Global Account Managers. The most relevant barriers in Global Account Management are examined and their influence on the relationship between global supplier and global buyer are discussed. The findings should provide help in understanding the global mechanisms and emphasize the need for customization towards individual customer requests in Global Account Management.
