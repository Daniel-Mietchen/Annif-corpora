"The only book to provide a unified view of the interplay between computationalnumber theory and cryptographyComputational number theory and modern cryptography are two of the most important and fundamental research fields in information security. There are many textbooks on computational number theory or cryptography. However, textbooks integrating both topics are rare. This book not only introduces the basic concepts and results in the two fields, but also introduces many advanced topics. Mathematical ideas are presented first, thereupon treating cryptography as an immediate application of the mathematical ideas. The author covers topics from number theory which are relevant for applications in public-key cryptography. The most popular public-key cryptosystems are based on difficult computational problems, such as factorization of large positive integers and the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields or on elliptic curves over finite fields. The book also covers modern topics, such as coding and lattice based cryptography, which are relevant for so-called post-quantum cryptography. The author goes over the basics in the first six chapters, followed by application to the most common cryptographic algorithms in the following three chapters. Finally areas of current research are touched in the last three chapters. Serious mathematical problems behind these applications will be explained at the level accessible to computer scientists and engineers. Makes deep mathematical problems accessible to computer scientists and engineers Based on classroom tested materials used in the US, UK and China Exercises included in every chapter Instructor resources available on the book's Companion Website "--

units were removed while others were fully reused for this application purpose. The communication between these dedicated hardware blocks were shown by writing the software for the TACO processor in virtual assembly. As a test case, three of the efficient algorithms widely used in cryptography, specifically modular multiplication and exponentiation, were implemented in TACO processor. Three algorithms, extended Euclidean algorithm, Montgomery reduction algorithm and Montgomery exponentiation algorithm, were implemented in two different scenarios: in one all algorithms were implemented as a separate functional unit and in another all algorithms are incorporated into one functional unit. As a test, RSA encryption was done using these algorithms with maximum key size of 32-bits.

"Public key cryptography is a major interdisciplinary subject with many real-world applications, such as digital signatures. A strong background in the mathematics underlying public key cryptography is essential for a deep understanding of the subject, and this book provides exactly that for students and researchers in mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering. Carefully written to communicate the major ideas and techniques of public key cryptography to a wide readership, this text is enlivened throughout with historical remarks and insightful perspectives on the development of the subject. Numerous examples, proofs and exercises make it suitable as a textbook for an advanced course, as well as for self-study. For more experienced researchers it serves as a convenient reference for many important topics: the Pollard algorithms, Maurer reduction, isogenies, algebraic tori, hyperelliptic curves and many more"--

Testing of VoIP security problems is essential to enterprises providing real-time data and services. The critical infrastructure can be compromised and data to be regularly exposed. This information may be used by malicious hackers for illegal purposes. At the same time consumers are connecting their smartphones and other personal devices to the network. The business with private and secured data is becoming more and more important in our everyday life. The major security threat for enterprises today is discovering existing unknown vulnerabilities from used software. Unknown vulnerabilities may cause a lot of serious problems, attacks utilizing security holes may continue undetected (while customer safety is compromised) and the repair process tends to be slow once an attack is detected. Additionally, during maintenance there is downtime when customer services are not accessible. Naturally, all downtime is damaging company reputation and eventually affecting to company profits. Security related bugs are likely to exist in platforms when facing with new technologies which are complex to implement and when software versions are often a released detriment of testing. Also, an increasing number of vulnerabilities have not been published but instead those may end to be used and shared within underground hacker communities. Companies and enterprises need to find preventive actions to protect their products and services because it takes too much time to wait fixed software releases from vendors. In this thesis work the protocol model from a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is implemented using the Codenomicon Test Tool platform. The product can send valid and anomalous data transmissions to the test application over the Internet. This is technique (or testing method) called fuzzing or fuzz testing. Software robustness can be verified and unknown or zero-day vulnerabilities may be found with fuzzing. RTP data is typically audio, video or other streaming content. RTP data (or media stream) is usually transferred and embedded within another protocol. The SRTP Test Suite can utilize other Codenomicon test tools to do media signaling negotiation with the test targets in a way which is secure when it comes to cryptography. Thus, the result of the connection parameters may be used to get connected with a wider variety of test targets and send an SRTP fuzzing data stream to these applications.
