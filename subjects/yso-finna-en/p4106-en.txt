Psychological and psychoeducational assessment of children and adolescents who are deaf and hard of hearing
Now in its second edition, Introduction to Aural Rehabilitation continues to provide all the elements necessary for a comprehensive, practice-oriented course in the habilitation/rehabilitation of children, adults, and the elderly with impaired hearing. This user-friendly text focuses on the most important clinical and practical aspects of providing services to the hearing impaired, while avoiding the technical detail of theoretical texts. This second edition offers more in-depth information on cochlear implantation--including surgical procedures as well as the benefits for children and adults--and is approached from an amplification standpoint across several chapters by new contributing authors

This is an introductory text on mental health and deafness for care workers and mental health workers, both those familiar with deaf people but not with mental health and those familiar with mental health but not with deaf people. It covers a wide range of mental health issues as they relate to deafness and is divided into two sections. The first, Assessment, includes topics ranging from child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry, children who are deaf and have multiple disabilities, addictive behaviour and deafness, to maltreatment of deaf children. The second section, Management and Intervention, discusses interpreters in mental health settings, educational interventions, family therapy and drug treatments. The contributors to this book, some of who are deaf themselves, come from a range of professional disciplines and are international experts in their fields.

Prospects are changing for individuals with hearing loss. Infants and toddlers discovered to be deaf or hard of hearing can be aided or implanted with state-of-the-art technology, and the people in the children?s lives can learn to enrich and accentuate their access to sound and help them learn to listen. These children can learn more than one spoken language and can learn to read, write, sing, and play musical instruments. Deafness in all its audiogrammatic forms can be treated in one way or another. Unless someone chooses deafness for a particular child, no child needs to remain in silence or even in partial sound. This book is about learning to listen and speak in order to learn to read and write. It deals with the evidence of persistent low literacy levels in many individuals with hearing loss and with evidence of higher literacy levels in those with hearing loss who have learned to listen. At a time when technology is racing along to produce ever better access to sound, this book attempts to pull together the dominant literacy research done in the ?hearing world? and apply it to the world of the deaf and hard of hearing who can now experience all sorts of sound. The author makes the argument that helping a child learn to listen is the best insurance that he or she will learn to read and write. It comes from both a research-based and a personal point of view.

This article will assist those Teachers, Carers or Parents who come into contact with Deafblind, Deaf Multiple Handicapped and Deaf people, who wish to use a combination of skills with Music, Touch, Communication and Movements. These techinques will assist Professionals to get the best results from the resources they have available within their own environment. The students will be able to experience something new and be able to feel relaxed which may assist them to improve in other areas, such as Daily Living Skills and becoming more independent. These ideas will provide a foundation ffor future Music and Movement Programmes and should help to improve their own "Quality of Life".

Ethnic Background in Relation to Other Characteristics of Hearing Impaired Students in the United States : data from the annual survey of hearing impaired children and youth
Thirty million people across all boundaries of life - friends, parents, grandparents and co-workers - face accepting an acquired hearing loss. An almost invisible disability, the effects of even a slight hearing loss can render experiences in the "hearing world" tenuous and fraught with barriers. Thoughtful and insightful, Dr. Michael Harvey, a clinical psychologist, gives us a glimpse into the lives of ten people; each a resonating example of feelings and circumstances - a hard-of-hearing teen struggling to find her place between two worlds, grown children trying to persuade their elderly mother to accept hearing aids. Propelled on an odyssey of frustration and isolation, change and growth, these people, through fascinating therapeutic dialogue, uncover ways to meet their challenges. Each story is an important and healing gift for people who love and cherish, offer professional care to, or are themselves people with hearing loss, and provides a compassionate look at the unique and the universal issues faced by anyone who has struggled with loss.

This book presents chapters by many eminent researchers and interventionists, all of whom address the development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children in the context of family and school. A variety of disciplines and perspectives are provided in order to capture the complexity of factors affecting development of these children in their diverse environments. Consistent with current theory and educational practice, the book focuses most strongly on the interaction of family and child strengths and needs and the role of educational and other interventionists in supporting family and child growth. This work, and the authors represented in it, have been influenced by the seminal work of Kathryn P. Meadow-Orlans, whose work continues to apply a multidisciplinary, developmental approach to understanding the development of deaf children. The book differs from other collections in the degree to which the chapters share ecological and developmental theoretical bases. A synthesis of information is provided in section introductions and in an afterword provided by Dr. Meadow-Orlans. The book reflects emerging research practice in the field by representing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. e chapters in the book may surprise readers in that they present a more positive view of family and child functioning than has historically been the case in this field. This is consistent with emerging data from deaf and hard of hearing children who have benefitted from early identification and intervention. In addition, it represents an emerging recognition of strengths shown by the children and by their deaf and hearing parents. The book moves from consideration of child and family to a focus on the role and effects of school environments on development. Issues of culture and expectations pervade the chapters in this section of the book, which includes chapters addressing effects of school placement options, positive effects of learning about deaf culture and history, effects of changing educational practice in developing nations, and the need for increased knowledge about ways to meet individual needs of the diverse group of deaf and hard of hearing students. Thus, the book gives the reader a coherent view of current knowledge and issues in research and intervention for deaf and hard of hearing children and their families.
