Trojan is a novel leukocyte-specific protein cloned from chicken (Gallus gallus) embryonic thymocytes. The molecule is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular CCP domain followed by two FN3 domains. Its cytoplasmic tail is predicted to possess a MAPK docking and a PKA phosphorylation site. Trojan displays differential expression on developing thymocyte subpopulations. It is high on CD4 and CD8 double negative, and CD4 or CD8 single positive cells, but diminishes from the surface of selection-undergoing CD4 and CD8 double positive cells. This expression pattern is similar to that of anti-apoptotic molecules such as IL-7Rα and BCL-2. We hypothesised an involvement of Trojan in the regulation of apoptosis, possibly as an anti-apoptotic receptor. Our in vitro studies with a T cell line showed that upon apoptosis induction, Trojan expression rises dramatically on the surface of surviving cells and gradually decreases towards its normal levels as cells recover. When sorted based on their Trojan levels, cells with high expression appear less susceptible to apoptotic induction than those bearing no Trojan on their surface. Cells that overexpress Trojan from a cDNA plasmid show elevated steady state intracellular calcium, suggesting the molecule is able to transmit cytoplasmic signals. In addition, computational analyses pointed towards an involvement of MAPK and a possible regulatory mechanism by PKA.Trojan belongs to a novel gene family that includes two other members in the chicken. One is a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase named Mystran, and the other - a transmembrane protein with an ITAM, named Thracian. We discovered the family in other avian species and found related genes in reptiles and coalecanth fish. We observed dynamic adaptation of their extracellular regions possibly in concert with ligand-binding, association with other surface molecules or as a response to pathogen challenges. This was coupled to largely unchanged cytoplasmic tails, suggesting a conserved signalling mechanism.The presented study shows that a novel avian leukocyte protein called Trojan possibly has an anti-apoptotic role. It belongs to a gene family that was subjected to evolutionary selection, likely linked to the molecular function of the proteins.

"The integrin family is composed of 24 members and approximately ten years ago (2003) we published a book devoted to the nine I domain integrin subunits. In this second edition, I am pleased that most of the original authors have been able to contribute to the updated version. I domain containing integrins include collagen receptors and leukocyte receptors. In 2003 the knockout mouse phenotypes for all of the I domain integrins had not yet been published; they are now, and are summarized and discussed in this edition. Interestingly, a recent 10 integrin mutation in dogs has indicated that collagen-binding integrins in the musculoskeletal system might have much more severe phenotypes in larger animals/humans compared to the mild integrin phenotypes observed in collagen-binding integrin deficient mice. This finding is further discussed in the book. In the cancer field, the microenvironment is taking center stage, and here collagen receptors on fibroblasts are predicted to play important roles in paracrine signaling, in regulating tissue stiffness and matrix remodeling. New technologies, new mouse models in combination with analyses of I integrins in larger animals/humans are thus predicted to increase our knowledge about this group of receptors. With this in mind we look forward to another 10 years of research with I domain integrins." -- (Back Cover)
