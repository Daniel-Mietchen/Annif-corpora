"The new edition of Introduction to Global Logistics considers how the logistics industry has developed; how it is influenced by macro-economic factors and demand-side trends; what the risks are to the industry and how it will develop over the coming years. Author John Manners-Bell examines individual logistics segments looking at each one's unique microeconomic dynamics. He explains how logistics companies' revenues and profitability are affected by a downturn and how this is governed by such factors as whether they own assets or manage them.Chapters define, explore, and describe six key logistics segments: freight forwarding, contract logistics, shipping, road freight, air cargo, and express, while also examining the individual supply chain dynamics and logistics demands of the major vertical sectors: Automotive, Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Consumer, and High Tech. The book covers important trends and developments that are shaping the industry, including 3D printing, megacities, and post-harvest food losses"--

"Supply Chain Strategy" is today's most comprehensive resource for up-to-the-minute thinking and practices on developing supply chain strategies that support a company's overall objectives.Covering world-class practices and systems, taken from the files of Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, General Electric, and other companies, it covers essential supply chain subjects including: logistics data mining - for identifying the root cause of material and information flow problems, pinpointing opportunities for process improvements, and providing an objective basis for project-team decision making; and, inventory planning and management - presenting metrics, processes, and systems for forecasting, demand planning, and inventory control, yielding lower inventory levels and improved customer service. It also covers: logistics information systems and Web-based logistics - helping to substitute information for inventory and work content; transportation and distribution - for connecting sourcing locations with customers at the lowest cost by, among other things, leveraging private and third-party transportation systems; and, logistics organization development - including the seven disciplines that link enterprises across the supply chain, as well as logistics activities within those enterprises.
