Nutritive value of meat and bone meal for growing pigs
The paper presents the soil formation processes that take place in the gangue heaps resulted from iron mining ore at Capus quarry, Cluj County, Romania. The gangue which resulted was transported and piled up into heaps, without uncovering and a selective separation of the layers, such a low-fertility material resulted. This heap was partially levelled and used in plantation of pine (Pinus sylvestris), perennial gramineae (Lolium perenne, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense), locust (Robinia pseudacacia) and spruce fir (Picea abies). After 25 years of recultivating, profiles were opened under the pine and gramineae plantations and physical and chemical analyses were carried out and compared to those of the initial heap. An evolution of the main pedogenetical indices (pH, humus, total nitrogen and mobile phosphorus and potassium) was observed in both of the studied profiles. The results show that after 25 years of planting the gangue heap with the two cultures, some layers of soil were formed, which, in a certain extent, have characteristics of the pedogenetic horizons, the evolution of the entianthrosoils towards a certain soil type being evident. The soil towards which these entianthrosoils evolve is of the Regosoil type.

Anaerobic digestion of solid poultry slaughterhouse by-products and wastes
Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a by-product of the meat industry and is an important pathway for recycling of N and P. MBM contains about 8% N, 5% P, 1% K and 10% Ca. Field trials compared the effects of MBM and mineral  fertilizer on yield and quality of sugar beet (2008-2009) and carrot (2010-2011) in Finland. MBM fertilisation of sugar beet grown on clay loam and sandy clay soil gave 11.4% (2008) and 19.6% (2009) lower yields than mineral fertilizers. The lower root yield in 2008 was compensated by higher extractable sugar content and lower amino-N, K and Na in root but no such compensation in root quality was detected for 2009. Mixing MBM with mineral NPK fertilizers had similar effects as MBM-alone. MBM (80 kg N ha-1 2010 and 60 kg N ha-1 2011) together with K fertilizer (Patentkali®, 180 kg K ha-1) were applied for carrot to a fine sandy till soil in 2010 and sandy loam in 2011. MBM alone gave 14% lower total and marketable root yield than mineral fertilization. The lower yield was compensated by improved quality, lower NO3- content in the carrot and good storability. Adding extra fertilizer during growth or separating fertilization applications had no effect on root yield or quality. MBM performed in these cases mainly as an organic N fertilizer. The N supply from MBM is not sufficient for achieving same yields as with mineral fertilizers. The relative N efficiency of total N of MBM was 83% that of mineral fertilizers. MBM should be targeted on soils with low P status.  We conclude that MBM is a reasonably competitive alternative to mineral fertilizers, and as a recycled fertilizer it is a good option for organic production.

We conducted a pot experiment to study the fertilization effects of four N- and P-rich organic waste resources alone and in combination with K-rich bottom wood ash at two application rates (150 kg N ha-1 + 120 kg K ha-1, 300 kg N ha-1 + 240 kg K ha-1). Plant-available N was the growth-limiting factor. 48-73% of N applied with meat and bone meal (MBM) and composted fish sludge (CFS) was taken up in aboveground biomass, resulting in mineral fertilizer equivalents (MFE%) of 53-81% for N uptake and 61-104% for yield. MFE% of MBM and CFS decreased for increasing application rates. Two industrial composts had weak N fertilization effects and are to be considered soil conditioners rather than fertilizers. Possible P and K fertilization effects of waste resources were masked by the soil's ability to supply plant-available P and K, but effects on plant-available P and K contents in soil suggest that the waste resources may have positive effects under more nutrient-deficient conditions.
