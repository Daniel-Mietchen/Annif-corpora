The forthcoming 20-year period offers an unprecedented opportunity for spiritual growth. For the first time since the Golden Era of Atlantis, those who are ready can be bathed in ninth-dimensional frequencies to accelerate the ascension process. In this book, Diana Cooper and Tim Whild share their incredible knowledge of the Golden Era of Atlantis and offer information, exercises and meditations to become an Enlightened Master in this lifetime. They connect you to the highest frequency dragons, unicorns, angels and great Ascended Masters who are assisting you from many universes to move into your true potential. The entire book vibrates at the fifth to seventh dimensions, interwoven with incredible shining ninth-dimensional threads. Lord Kuthumi, the World Teacher, takes you into his 12 teaching temples where he and great Universal Angels and Masters take you on a training course into enlightenment and mastery. In addition, many of the greatest masters who serve our planet share their secrets and assistance. Lord Voosloo, the highest frequency High Priest to have served in Atlantis, has allowed us to access his incredible energy to take the reader to the highest levels now achievable on planet Earth. This book is a must-read for those who wish to fulfil their soul missions in this life and serve Gaia in the fifth dimension and beyond.
