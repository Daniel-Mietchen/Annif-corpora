Conversations with Witold Lutosławski (1987-92)
"Among the many treasures of The State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg is its remarkable collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Flemish paintings - more than five hundred in all - including key works by Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, Snyders and Teniers." "More than 140 artists are represented in the collection, and all are included in this complete catalogue, which provides a comprehensive picture of the golden age of Flemish painting, covering not only the oeuvres of the great masters but also those of more everyday figures. There are individual illustrated entries for every work, accompanied by detailed indexes and provenance information that provides a unique insight into the history of collecting in Russia."--BOOK JACKET.
