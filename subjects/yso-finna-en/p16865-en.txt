"Part I, Beginnings, is historical in scope. Its three sections, Classical and early modern ideas of memory, Enlightenment and romantic memory, and Memory and late modernity, lay out the key psychological, rhetorical, and cultural concepts of memory in the work of a range of thinkers from Plato to Walter Benjamin. Part II, Positionings, identifies three major perspectives through which memory has been defined and debated more recently: Collective memory; Jewish memory discourse; and trauma. Part III, Identities, examines the key role of memory in contemporary constructions of identity under the headings Gender; Race/nation; and Diaspora." -- Publisher's note.
