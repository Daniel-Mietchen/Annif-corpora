"The 2nd edition of Diagnostic Imaging: Abdomen was a major expansion of the 1st edition, containing over 150 additional diagnoses. In planning this, the 3rd edition, we soon realized that comprehensive coverage of all of the advances in imaging and management of abdominal disorders was no longer possible in a single volume text. Therefore, we elected to separate diagnoses into those judged primarily "gastrointestinal," covered in this thoroughly updated text, from the "genitourinary" topics, to be covered in a subsequent book. We have updated and replaced most images from the 2nd edition, maintaining only those judged to be so classic that newer examples would not be an improvement. All references and text have been updated as well, with all material being current to within a few months of the publication date of this book."--Provided by publisher.
