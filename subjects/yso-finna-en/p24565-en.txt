Introduction to finite and spectral element methods using MATLAB®
"The authors believe that users of finite element analysis (FEA) software products must have a basic understanding of how mathematical models are constructed; what are the essential assumptions incorporated in a mathematical model; what is the algorithmic structure of the finite element solution; how the accuracy of the computed data can be assessed, and how to avoid common pitfalls and mistakes. The primary objective in assembling the material presented in the book is to provide a basic working knowledge of the finite element method. A professional quality software product will also be made available to the reader providing over 400 parameter-controlled examples of solved problems."--

The purpose of this book is to provide an up-to-date introduction to the time-domain finite element methods for Maxwell's equations involving metamaterials. Since the first successful construction of a metamaterial with both negative permittivity and permeability in 2000, the study of metamaterials has attracted significant attention from researchers across many disciplines. Thanks to enormous efforts on the part of engineers and physicists, metamaterials present great potential applications in antenna and radar design, sub-wavelength imaging, and invisibility cloak design. Hence the efficient simulation of electromagnetic phenomena in metamaterials has become a very important issue and is the subject of this book, in which various metamaterial modeling equations are introduced and justified mathematically. The development and practical implementation of edge finite element methods for metamaterial Maxwell's equations are the main focus of the book. The book finishes with some interesting simulations such as backward wave propagation and time-domain cloaking with metamaterials.

Techniques and Tools for Solving Acoustics Problems. This is the first book of its kind that describes the use of ANSYS® finite element analysis (FEA) software, and MATLAB® engineering programming software to solve acoustic problems. It covers simple text book problems, such as determining the natural frequencies of a duct, to progressively more complex problems that can only be solved using FEA software, such as acoustic absorption and fluid-structure-interaction. It also presents benchmark cases that can be used as starting points for analysis.

Since the early 70's, mixed finite elements have been the object of a wide and deep study by the mathematical and engineering communities. The fundamental role of this method for many application fields has been worldwide recognized and its use has been introduced in several commercial codes. An important feature of mixed finite elements is the interplay between theory and application. Discretization spaces for mixed schemes require suitable compatibilities, so that simple minded approximations generally do not work and the design of appropriate stabilizations gives rise to challenging mathematical problems. This volume collects the lecture notes of a C.I.M.E. course held in Summer 2006, when some of the most world recognized experts in the field reviewed the rigorous setting of mixed finite elements and revisited it after more than 30 years of practice. Applications, in this volume, range from traditional ones, like fluid-dynamics or elasticity, to more recent and active fields, like electromagnetism.

"This book covers using practical computational techniques for simulating behavior of rotational structures and then using the results to improve fidelity and performance. Applications of rotor dynamics are associated with important energy industry machinery, such as generators and wind turbines, as well as airplane engines and propellers. This book presents techniques that employ the finite element method for modeling and computation of forces associated with the rotational phenomenon. The authors also discuss state-of-the-art engineering software used for computational simulation, including eigenvalue analysis techniques used to ensure numerical accuracy of the simulations"--

"For mathematicians and engineers interested in applying numerical methods to physical problems this book is ideal. Numerical ideas are connected to accompanying software, which is also available online. By seeing the complete description of the methods in both theory and implementation, students will more easily gain the knowledge needed to write their own application programs or develop new theory. The book contains careful development of the mathematical tools needed for analysis of the numerical methods, including elliptic regularity theory and approximation theory. Variational crimes, due to quadrature, coordinate mappings, domain approximation and boundary conditions, are analyzed. The claims are stated with full statement of the assumptions and conclusions, and use subscripted constants which can be traced back to the origination (particularly in the electronic version, which is available online and on the accompanying CD-ROM)"--
