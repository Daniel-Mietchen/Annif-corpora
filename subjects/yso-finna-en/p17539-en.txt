"From the penthouse to the sewers--the political geography of the vertical city Vertical is a brilliant re-imagining of the world we live in. Today we live in a world that can no longer be read as a two-dimensional map. In Vertical Stephen Graham rewrites the city at every level, calling for a a new understanding of our surroundings that takes into account above and below: why Dubai has been built to be seen from GoogleEarth; how the superrich in Sao Paulo live their penthouse lives far from the street; why London billionaires build vast subterranean basements rather than move house. Vertical will make you look at the city anew: from the viewfinders of drones, satellites, from the top of skyscrapers, at street-level and from underground bunkers: this is a new politics of space and geography"--

"This collection looks at transnational infrastructures, from the first ceremonial train of the European Coal and Steel Community to the new border signs replacing checkpoints along motorways, and how such infrastructural links are part of the long history of European unification". --Provided by publisher.
The financial system consists of financial institutions and the market infrastructures that connect them. They are both key to the stability of the system as a whole. The basic assumption is that infrastructures function reliably, and their criticality is noticed only in the event of a disruption. Stability analysis should, therefore, increasingly extend its focus to include both the functioning of infrastructures and their interconnectedness with financial institutions..

Finnish securities settlement and custody servicing is undergoing a major reform. The timetable is tight. The controlled execution of the projects, on time, is essential due to the systemic importance of the securities markets infrastructure and the competitiveness of the Finnish markets. The reform is based on the EU Regulation on central securities depositories, and the centralised platform for securities settlement, preparations for which have been headed by the ECB. These projects are considerable in terms of scale and are necessary for achieving sustainable cost and risk reductions..

Investment and the use of tax and toll revenues in the transport sector
Over the years tourism has become one of the largest industries in the world, starting to develop more and more forms of accommodation and recreational activity, particularly in countryside areas. Nowadays, agritourism is one of the most rapidly growing segments of tourism and it has been identified as a form of rural tourism that ensures both development and conservation. However, rural territories and infrastructure are being adapted to the exigencies of tourists, so that many physical changes are taking place. This study questions how the physical impact of agritourism activities influences the social, economic and organisational aspects of rural territories in the Province of Siena in Italy.  Within the literature consulted by the author, many studies have emphasised several issues occurring to rural areas after the development of agritourism infrastructure. Thus, this study focuses on three key issues: first, the adaptation of old rural infrastructure to tourists' exigencies; second, the modification of the social environment and its economic activities; third and last, the use of local entrepreneurships as main territorial management system.  One of the main purposes of this study is to help rural communities to understand the causes that have brought physical changes to their territories, especially within infrastructure. Therefore, a qualitative study was retained by the author as the most apposite research position. A single case study research strategy was considered the most appropriated qualitative research methodology and it influenced the use of in-depth interview to gather primary data on the three key issues. The author identified then two target groups of respondents: agritourism operators and territorial administrators. With the use of the snowball sampling method the author was able to collect four interviews.  In the process of data analysis, this research used a single case study with multiple units of analysis composed by an individual unit level, a group unit level and a multiple unit level. However, although all the three levels were used to analyse the data, only the group unit level and the multiple unit level were fully described in this study. The display and presentation of data allowed the author to identify differences between the respondents.     Overall, the results of the research confirmed the positive aspects of agritourism in terms of sustainable development and conservation of rural territories. However, the interrelations between territorial administrators and agritourism operators should be improved. In fact, both professional figures recognised the lack of understanding of each others' goals, which caused a further lack of collaboration. Accordingly, agritourism players in the Province of Siena should join their forces in marketing activities, with the use of Internet, as well as ensuring the continuous existence of local farmers via diversification of local products.

"Have you ever wondered how the water in your faucet gets there? Where your garbage goes? What the pipes under city streets do? How bananas from Ecuador get to your local market? Why radiators in apartment buildings clang? Using New York City as its point of reference, The Works takes readers down manholes and behind the scenes to explain exactly how an urban infrastructure operates. Deftly weaving text and graphics, author Kate Ascher explores the systems that manage water, traffic, sewage and garbage, subways, electricity, mail, and much more. Full of fascinating facts and anecdotes, The Works gives readers a unique glimpse at what lies behind and beneath urban life in the twenty-first century."--Back cover.

This timely new book provides an international perspective on Public Private Partnerships. Through 21 case studies, it investigates the existing and fast developing body of principles and practices from a wide range of countries and is the first book to bring together leading international academics and practitioners under a common framework that enables convenient cross-country comparisons. The authors focus on the impact of the financial crisis has had on how governments have reviewed and overhauled their PPP policies as they have examined or tested new ways of partnering more effectively, efficiently and sustainably with the private sector. Readers will be able to gauge the level of maturity of PPP development in the book's case studies, understand similarities and differences in their practices, and gain useful insights into the regulatory framework and institutional infrastructure in place to support implementation of PPP. Finally, the book offers insights into the future challenges and opportunities that PPP offers stakeholders.

China is entering a new stage of economic and societal development, called China 2.0, a new era that is characterized by China?s diminishing low-cost advantage and increased local competition. Succeeding in the China 2.0 era will require western managers to reposition their businesses. Inspired by their extensive experience in doing business in China, the authors present more than 40 key issues in a compact format suitable for time-constrained executives. The book covers the overall effects on the economy, highlights future challenges, gives first-hand advice on how to manage a business in China, and helps the reader to understand the Chinese culture. China Business 2.0 also contains valuable insight sections in which top executives and consultants share their on-the-ground-experiences in China. In addition, it features numerous practical tips that will help managers to be effective in China.
