The objective of this thesis was to compare the behaviour of different fillers used in low grammage printing papers. For this thesis the most important paper quality parameters were opacity, brightness and tensile and tear strengths. Also retention was studied. In the first part of the work the critical properties of paper affected by the fillers and the critical properties of low grammage printing papers and production process were studied. The properties and applications of used fillers were also explained. In the experimental part of the thesis two trials were made. The results were compared to old production results.

Fillers and pigments are used in paper manufacturing for low material expenses and to increase optical properties such as opacity and brightness. In this thesis effects of additives in thinprint grade papers were studied. The purpose was to get a clear view on how different individual filler pigments change the optical properties of both base paper and calandered paper. Based on the results further trial runs were made with additives that enhanced desirable properties in paper. In the second trial paper was made with 18 different mixes of fillers. Each mixture contained PCC and two other additives. Mixtures were in groups of four, where amount of PCC was kept constant and the quantity of the other two varied.
