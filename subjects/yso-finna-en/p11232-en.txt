Eunuchs both `embarrassed and intrigued the ancient world'. These thirteen essays, all but one from a conference held in Cardiff in 1999, reflect the recent revival in interest in these enigmatic `half men' who often played a significant role in the court politics of Persia, Greece, Rome and Byzantium. Subjects include the royal harem in Achaemenud Persia, Greek attitudes towards eunuchs and mutilation, female cults, Roman art, eunuchs and Early Christianity, court eunuchs in Byzantium, eunuch power in China and the castrati of post-medieval Italy.
