Abstract: User interface design for existing system monitoring application.  The main purpose of the project was to make use of elements of interface design to create an application. Another purpose was to see how Enoro (customer) Generis system (customer's internal system) merges with the web in particular application. The goal was to create an application web interface for existing System Monitoring application. ASP.NET framework with C# programming language, Enoro Generis System and user interface design elements were used for creating the application. The application serves Enoro's customers to monitor their servers and view the result via web interface. The application development is still ongoing. The final product was not aimed for this study but the thesis application well demonstrates the concept of final application. The application carries good importance to both Enoro and its customers regarding business values and system robustness monitoring and immediate problem fixing. The application also demonstrates how user interface design influences application's use. The concept of the application itself is important for users who can easily know what is going on in their systems regardless of their location and the platform they use.

Abstract: This project was carried out for Process Vision Oy and the main goal was to find solutions for improving the current Work Order Management (a part of GENERIS application). As GENERIS is a standard information system for different energy markets, the current Work Order platform needs a more effective management interface. The process of following up with existing work orders needed to be improved, so that users could effectively manage all work order data within the system. The new user interface should be productive, user-friendly and it must follow a common design pattern. Improvement ideas were collected based on existing requirements and analogue use cases. It was necessary to implement a prototype for Work Order Follow Ups module using the existing GENERIS Meter Asset Management platform. Since GENERIS is an energy information system that is built on the Windows operating system, the new implementation was done using the Microsoft Foundation Class framework and the C++ pro-gramming language. The prototype needed to be evaluated and tested against specific use cases using a test database. The result of the project was the implementation of new user interfaces which could in-crease users' productivity in basic use cases. This thesis also analysed the existing work-flow definition object in GENERIS platform, which resembled the work order object. There were certain limits which eliminated the possibility to develop new work order object based on the workflow definition object. However, a suggestion for a new data model was also described in this thesis.

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to design user interfaces of three different administrator features for social learning platform. The goal of this thesis was to design user interfaces that would offer high usability and functionality.    The Constantly growing amount of social and networking web services and the informal learning taking place in those services have changed traditional e-learning, as more formal learning style to be old-fashioned. Nowadays, many e-learning companies have started to focus more on informal learning and ways that it could be used in a corporate environment. The client company has started developing Soclet in 2009 and in 2010 the first version was ready with the idea of combining learning management systems with social features that provide informal style of learning.    The learning platform is mainly built with Ruby on Rails -framework together with HTML and JavaScript technologies. The platforms development process is managed with a variation of agile development methodologies called Scrum. Scrum is a iterative development process that is very flexible, because of the short development periods and constant prioritization of requirement tasks. Scrum was included in this thesis to keep the design work connected with the core process of project development.    Features chosen for this thesis were user account removal, user role management and the dashboard. All three features were designed starting with paper sketches and continuing with wireframe models to ensure that the final design was functional and possible to implement. The outcome was a highly usable user interface plan for each feature. User management was improved with easy way to disable user accounts and a new role management feature that makes the access control more flexible in the service. The new modular dashboard design opens new possibilities for developers to extend the administrator panel in the future..

The Photo Viewer Application
This work was done in a company named TactoTek, which is specialized in embedding electronic components into 3D molded plastic. The technology allows curved touch interfaces produced cost efficiently by integrating infrared transmitters and receivers into molded plastic. How to design an optical touch application that runs on a microcontroller of limited power and processing resources providing touch functionality that meets today’s standards. The basic concepts of infrared detection and the frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) phenomenon are gone through. The SW and HW architecture, signal processing and algorithms are described at high level. A prototype device was developed with PC connectivity in order to read the runtime data to be displayed in the signal monitoring application and to feed the algorithm on computer. A simulator SW was developed to explore different kinds of methods for calculating touch points. The best algorithm candidate was integrated in a microcontroller providing digital interface for host device communication. The prototype’s performance and accuracy was evaluated by using a robot tester and other manual measurement methods. In the end the prototype device was integrated in a cell phone with a rebuilt mechanics.The developed touch application has an accurate multi touch functionality and allows input to be given with gloved hands. In addition, a touch size, shape and relative pressure are calculated. This study proves that this technology has potential and it can compete with the existing technologies providing a good performance, accuracy and a multi-touch functionality. The challenge in the technology is the activation sensitivity compared to the capacitive, which does not need a physical contact for a touch activation. On the other hand the FTIR panel provides a more natural and secure input method for applications where unintentional touches should be avoided. This could be advantageous in consumer applications where usually buttons and switches have been used, for example household and automotive applications. In order to achieve an optimal solution, more studies are needed in the material, hardware and signal processing.

Abstract: The goal of the thesis was to design and develop a new user interface for an image archive. The archive is accessed on the intranet server through the user's web browser. To limit the scope of the thesis, no changes to the database were planned. The user interface was set to be designed from a user centred point of view. For the design, the users were interviewed. The interview was based on a set group of questions, but the line of questions was not strictly followed during the interview. From the interview it was found out that the image archive has two kinds of users, architects and users working in tourism and travel. Both types of have similar requirements for the archive. The users search the archive for images of a certain building or certain types of images. The users are also required to upload images to the archive. Individual pages of the user interface were designed based on the interviews. On the search page the users can define search conditions and search for images based on the conditions. The search page leads to the results page, which displays search results as thumbnails. The user can inspect images by placing the mouse cursor on top of the thumbnail, which causes metadata for the image to be displayed on a box on the right. From the results page the user can enter a browse view by clicking on a thumbnail. On the browse page the user can see the single image in a larger size and navigate to the previous and next images. In the browse page the user can also edit saved metadata and export images from the archive. Adding images to the archive was were decided to be made easier by adding an batch edit system to the archive, where the user can write metadata information to an image by a single mouse click. The images are added to the archive directly from the user's computer. After development and deployment, the archive user interface has been observed to be useful and functional. Significant improvements include quickly browsing through multiple images and saving images to the user's computer. Feedback from the new archive user interface from the users has been mostly positive.

The main aim of this thesis was to describe how a single UI code could be used in different operating systems. The objective in this thesis was to bring out the main key points how a hybrid HTML5 application can be implemented by using iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components as a container for a hybrid application. This thesis also describes how a data transfer is done between HTML, JavaScript and native code. As a starting point, a hybrid application was implemented in both Android and iOS platforms. I wanted to implement an application, which would give value for the end users. I studied some time for open web APIs and found out that Finnkino Movie Company was providing a free XML API for their services and the application idea was found. I interviewed some of my friends about the functional needs for the application and also about how the UI should look like. The application itself was designed to use only one platform specific native WebView component. The User Interface was built with the HTML elements and JavaScript because the UI should look the same in both platforms. In my application the native code handles the XML data parsing from the Finnkino’s web API and sends the parsed data to the calling JavaScript function, which will then place the data into the HTML elements dynamically. When the application was completed, all the differences between the platforms were studied and documented into this thesis. As a result iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components provide a good support for a hybrid application development with some minor differences. The main difference is the performance and how responsive the UI is in these platforms. From the development point of view, I see a great opportunity to implement mobile applications with a web technology, as it is a fast evolving environment introducing new possibilities for the developers in a very fast phase. And from the business point of view, I can see a great opportunity for smaller companies, or individual developers because with a single effort the application UI can be created for multiple platforms and this saves money and resources.

This bachelor thesis is about how to study and integrate Bootstrap 3 into OpixManager. The purpose is to improve user interface of OpixManager application. OpixManager is constructed by using CodeIgniter and Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. OpixManager application is for project management. It includes staff augmentation, customer management, report management and so on. It is to support both scrum and traditional software development process. There are two major parts included in this thesis work. The theoretical part is about studying what is responsive web design, and what components are included in Bootstrap 3. The author also study how OpixManager's CodeIgniter interrelates among the model, the view and the controller in the theoretical part. The theoretical framework gives the author knowledge how to integrate Bootstrap template to OpixManager's user interface. The empirical part is actual implementation and testing of template page, login page and home page as well as its link pages in OpixManager. Final results has been tested in cross-browser through local host server such as Mozilla Firefox, in Internet Explorer and in Chrome. I used Freelancer template's design in this thesis. Typography and color palette are balanced and modern. Navigation bar and grid system are responsive, they are squeezed onto a tiny mobile device or stretched onto a wide screen.

The aim of this thesis was to improve the quality of the website, to increase the efficiency, productivity, user friendliness as well as minimize the number of errors encountered by the users while navigating the site. Making the website easier to use benefits the company to know which parts customers would select the most. The owner of the company would be able to redesign their website, add new features to target certain customers, edit an unclear or confusing feature and get information on a lacking content or features from the users. The test was done according to the Thinking Aloud test method and to collect and analyze the results, five different individuals having some technical knowledge were participated in the usability test. The participants were tested in a different time schedule in a well managed testing room. All the tasks done by the participants were recorded by the Morae Software during the test and this software was totally invisible to the test participants. It helped to find out the most lacking areas and whether the test users have the same type of usability problems on the website or not. After the usability test was completed, the results were analysed and compiled into a report, which contains actionable recommendations for fixing the observed issues from the test users with the website. Although the website was easy to use, user friendly and had some problems, the prototype visual version of the redesigned website was made and handed to the client.
Abstract: The goal of this project was to explain the steps taken to create a Graphical user interface (GUI) for the SIMO forest management-planning framework. This was achieved using the Flex Flash builder. The SIMO UI was built as a client-server. The method used in the project was to devise an experimental model that would make it easy to build the GUI with fewer codes and still makes it flexible and easy to maintain in the near future. Mapping the XML directly with the components model was finally used since it is the only popular method used frequently in encoding and decoding XML documents. The results obtained showed that the Flex Adobe datagrid was not fully developed for the project and as such, I had to create a custom datagrid, the datasheet. Furthermore, as at the time of building the GUI, there was no credible way to work with namespaced XML. This problem was later solved through a series of research and writing custom-components to suit the application. In conclusion, the goal of the project was achieved, flexibility and maintainability, but at the expense of excess codes.
