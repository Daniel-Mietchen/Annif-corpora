For students of human movement, kinesiology, dance science, and dancers, this book takes a positive approach to what a dancer can do to dance better through an understanding of anatomy and an analysis of movement which, in turn, will decrease injury rates. It presents anatomy and motion in a dance-specific way that teaches readers to appreciate and take ownership of their bodies.

This new title in the Encyclopaedia of Sports Medicine Series from the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee presents in one volume the latest information on neuromuscular function in sport and exercise. Chapters combine basic mechanistic knowledge with true applications; Topics covered include neuromuscular fatigue, neuromuscular training, and musculoskeletal loading, and special chapters examine recently developed research methodologies used during natural locomotion: high speed ultrasonography (US) and transmagnetic electrical stimulation (TMES). An important addition to the reference collections of biomechanists, sports medicine specialists, sport scientists, and graduate students in these areas, this volume is also appropriate for advanced level coaches and sport physiotherapists.

The book “High Performance Gymnastics” is a state-of-the-art documentation of sport science research in artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, coming from a collaboration between Brazil and Germany, and referring to the III. SIGARC congress, hosted 2012 in Sao Paulo (Brazil). International renowned authors provide in-detail discussions in the fields of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics. Psychological topics, such as the role of the coach in gymnastics or athletes’ perceptions towards gymnastics are discussed, as well as topics from biomechanics, training science, or history.
