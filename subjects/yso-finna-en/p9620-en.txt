Investment funds have emerged as significant financial intermediaries in Finland since the turn of the millennium. In this role, they supplement traditional deposit banking. However, from the perspective of financial stability, investment funds may also involve risks reminiscent of banking. One such key risk is if assets invested in funds are converted into significantly less liquid (less cash-convertible) form. Why can such liquidity transformation in a worst-case scenario pose a risk to financial stability, and how extensively is it performed among Finnish investment funds?.

Equity decoupling
" In Exchange-Traded Funds and the New Dynamics of Investing, Ananth Madhavan examines the quiet transformation of asset management through the rise of passive or index investing. A closely-related phenomenon is the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An ETF is an investment vehicle that trades intraday and seeks to replicate the performance of a specific index. ETFs have grown substantially in size, diversity, and market significance in recent years. These trends have generated considerable interest, especially from retail and institutional investors and increasingly from academics, regulators and the press. ETFs have the power to be a disruptive innovation to today's asset management industry because many traditional active managers and hedge funds deliver a significant fraction of their active returns via static exposures to factors like value. Indeed, for the first time ever, assets in global ETFs exceeded $3 trillion in 2015, passing the amount in hedge funds. "--

"Hedge Fund Market Wizards will be a modern day sequel to the highly successful Market Wizards and New Market Wizards written over 20 years ago. These two earlier volumes have become classics in the investment literature and have been read by virtually every hedge fund manager, as well as by a much broader lay audience. This new volume in the series will follow the same effective formula used by its predecessors. The book will devote a chapter to each of a broad array of highly successful traders, ranging widely in the markets they trade and their methodologies, but sharing in their achievement of superior performance. Each chapter, following the original format, will include an introductory section, a core section based on an interview with the trader, and a conclusion section that seeks to draw useful trading and investment lessons illustrated by the trader's approach and advice"--
