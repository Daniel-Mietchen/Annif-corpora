Updated with more than 30 percent new and revised material, this volume encompasses a total management approach that deals with the development of written programs, the identification of hazards, the mitigation of hazards by the use of common safety and health tools, the development of a safe workforce through communications, and motivational techniques including behavior-based safety, worker involvement, and stepped up training. More than just a source of information, this book provides practical applications for real world situations.
