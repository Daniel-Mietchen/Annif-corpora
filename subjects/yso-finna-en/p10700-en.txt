The actual foundation of the conference industry in Tampere took an appropriate shape after the establishment of Tampere Hall in 1990. Since then Tampere has been very active in promoting and organizing conferences of all kinds. The purpose, thus, of this study was to describe the process of organizing and managing conferences and analyze the conference industry in the Tampere Region. Sources of conference theories were used to describe the historical background of the industry's origin, its development and current trend. Data for analysis of Tampere as a conference destination were obtained through a standard questionnaire during the 23rd European Conference on Biomaterials (ESB 2010) at Tampere Hall on 11-15 September 2010. Quantitative analysis of the data was conducted through SPSS. The findings indicate that the industry dates back in 1884 during the congress of Vienna and developed into a proper industry in America in the 20th century. The findings reveal also that the process of organizing and managing conferences is a long procedure that involves several key players and encompasses other sectors such as tourism. It has also been noted that conference industry in Tampere existed even before the advent of Tampere Hall. It was due to Tampere being active in research, education and theater culture, plus due to the decline of the early industry in the region that brought about the establishment of purpose-built conference center - Tampere Hall. Conferences is an international industry that still grows. Despite offering massive employment opportunities and contributing to the world economy it lacks consistent data for quantification. There are less conference related courses in universities and the demand for professionals is on the increase. More courses on meeting events should be introduced in universities as a proactive approach in developing the industry in the region. Tampere Convention Bureau should work together with academic institutions to devise a method of managing meeting events records, and studies need to be carried out on the environmental impact of conference tourism. Key words: Conference, meetings industry, meeting events, tourism.

For fifteen years, Robert Stebbins has conducted extensive research on amateurs and professionals in theatre, music, archaeology, astronomy, baseball, football, magic and stand-up comedy. His publications give the theme of serious leisure in-depth scholarly attention. This text brings together the findings of this research project to provide a theoretical framework that reveals the commonalities across these eight fields. Throughout this project Stebbins has built on the work of Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss and their notion of "grounded theory". First, Stebbins extensively observed the routine activities of amateurs and professionals in each field studied. Then, as he became more familiar with the life-styles of the participants, he conducted lengthy, unstructured, face-to-face interviews with, in most cases, 30 amateur or professional respondents. Each field demanded special methods of observation, analysis, interviewing, probing and reporting. As much as possible, however, Stebbins asked similar questions of all respondents in all fields so as to permit generalizations across these diverse fields. The result was a "substantive grounded theory" of each field studied. Stebbins has developed a "formal grounded theory" of amateurs and professionals based on the research accumulated in all eight substantive fields. By transcending a variety of contexts, he argues, one can gain a more enduring appreciation of the elements that affect peoples' experiences in work and leisure pursuits. A review of the findings across this wide range of activities, including his findings and ideas on hobbyists and career volunteers, enabled Stebbins to derive better definitions of the main concepts of the project, such as "amateur", "the public", and "serious leisure" -- as well as "professional", where he distinguishes between client-centred and public-centred professionals who, while sharing numerous ideal-typical attributes, vary as

Over the past decades, professional public services have been burdened with demands for accountability and with businesslike managerial systems that are endemic to the private sector. In this volume, a team of international experts shows that these influences are relative. They present theoretical and empirical insights on broader changes in and around professional work in healthcare, social welfare, education, and policing. They also analyze coping mechanisms of professionals, which vary from sector to sector and they argue that public professionals will need to develop new skills for working in reconfigured public services.

In real life
Besides, war and famine, the major attraction on television is ironically space travel, particularly involving professional travellers to space. Recently, the number of non - professional space travellers has seemingly increased.  However, though space travel is new, the professional space travel industry does not fully appreciate the impact it could have on tourism. The international tourism industry is also one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world. As tourism gets saturated on the earth, tourists might have to find new trends. Technology has clearly helped in enhancing the choices of travel that tourists can have.     Because of the nature, of the professional space travel industry, this research was mainly inspired by the 2005 events of Virgin Galactic. Thus, the main objective of the research was to understand the pull factors of space tourism travel, based on the views of professional travellers, as well as the space travel industry players. Consequently, because tourism is a multifaceted industry, the research integrated corresponding tourism literature with space travel.  A theoretical pull factor model is implemented with reference from tourism related literature so as to demonstrate and understand the views that are perceived by the professional space travellers.       This research is conducted qualitatively.  Moreover, the World Wide Web, based on the electronic mailing system is employed.  Since the emphasis is to understand the world from the perspectives of the participants, the qualitative nature of electronic mailing system is resoundingly the most efficient tool for the purposes of this research.       The data was gathered based on the correspondence with Virgin Galactic, Space Adventures, Futron Corporation, Scientist A and Scientist B from NASA. Their, views were eventually integrated in relation to the grounded theory method of data analysis, as well as the matrix tabulation. Unfortunately, the most active participants of non-professional space travel (Rosaviakosmos) were clearly not interested in the research.    Suggestions for further studies are created by proposing a further research involving non- professional space travellers like Dennis Tito. The answers to the research questions are also addressed in the conclusions which are a created inspired by the interviews and results from data analysis. Conclusions are drawn to reveal the true nature of the space travel industry.

George Best, the mercurial Manchester United and Northern Ireland forward, possessed a genius that left opponents slack-jawed and earned him a legion of adoring fans. Off the pitch, as his striking good looks, devil-may-care attitude and mischievous charm made him the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status, Best became an icon. But fame came at a price, and his playing career was soon overshadowed by his lifestyle and an increasing dependence on the comforting embrace of alcohol. Whilst his tumultuous later years could never diminish the memories of the peerless, often breathtaking, quality of his football, they had a profound effect on his only son, Calum. Growing up with his mother in California, Calum's sporadic visits to see his father in England were all too rare, and he cherished every moment he could spend in the company of the man he adored. But as George's alcoholism spiralled out of control, inebriation frequently led to violence and George's self-destruction spilled over onto his son. Vivid, deeply moving, brave and honest, Second Best is the heart-breaking story of their relationship. It is a powerful tale of love and heartache, of an absent father and his wayward son, and of a family torn apart by addiction and intemperance.
