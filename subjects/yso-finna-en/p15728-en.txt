"As an architect, you want to integrate the best building envelope construction methods, materials science, and structural principles in your work, but you need a resource to help you. With more than seventy significant case studies located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia from prehistory to the present, this book illuminates the theory and techniques of assembling exteriors. Six chapters organized by wall types, from hand-set monolithic walls to digitally fabricated curtain walls, each have a material focus section to help you understand their intrinsic properties so that you can decide which will best keep the weather out of your building. Case studies include: Great Wall, China Israeli Supreme Court Building, Jerusalem, Ram Karmi and Ada Karmi-Melamed Fďřation Nationale du Bt́iments, Paris, Jean Prouv Ǐnstitut du Monde Arabe, Paris, Jean Nouvel Morgan Library, New York City, Renzo Piano Katsura Imperial Villa, Kyoto Sainsbury Center for Visual Arts, Norwich, UK, Sir Norman Foster"--

The facade is the visible surface of the building shell. It separates the interior from the exterior, form from function, users from passers-by. In addition to functional demands, the surrounding urban space and aesthetic appeal, sustainability parameters are gaining in importance in this day and age. For this reason, facade design, construction and technology receive ever-increasing attention in the building industry today. This volume provides an overview of the extensive range of possibilities, featuring the great creative and technical variety of today's facades. The presentation focuses on revealing photos, technical specifications, and detailed drawings. The projects from around the world vividly exemplify how the relationship between the interior and exterior is defined, designed and implemented in each individual case.
