Social work practice with adults has been undergoing a major change in recent years. The traditional divisions between health and social services have been gradually eroded, with the shift to the single assessment process and with social workers increasingly finding themselves employed within the health or independent sector. Therefore, knowing the full range of social work skills is vital and central to good practice with adult service users. This new guide will help students to understand these skills and includes chapters on intervention, empowerment and advocacy, skills for collaborative working, self-presentation and much more.

Developing customer acquisition process for a small-sized company : a case study of Kuljetusliike Mannerjärvi
Good customer service is vital for small tourism businesses. Customer service should aim at providing customers satisfying experiences, as satisfied customers are likely to associate with the company in the future; they are the foundation of all business. Small tourism businesses have a benefit over the large ones, as it is easier for smaller companies to respond to the individual clients' and varying customer groups' wishes and demands than it is for larger companies.    Challenging customer service situations are met in all industries. There is some general guidance on how to deal with these situations; listening, asking defining questions and showing concern towards the customer. The use of body language and reading the silent messages that the customer is giving out are also important. Good customer service person will already have excellent social skills, but these skills can also be learned or gained through work or training. No customer should leave the business dissatisfied; even if the customer is acting threateningly or is wrong.    The assignment for the thesis was set by the Tourism Team group, which operates under the Rural Police Committee. Eight small tourism businesses in Oulu area took part in the study that was conducted by themed interviews. The study findings mostly agree with the theory; this was not surprising as challenging customer service situations are a fairly widely studied topic in customer service literature.    As a result of the study, 10 cases of challenging customer service situations in small tourism businesses were produced; they will be used at the Service with a heart -trainings, which are run by the Tourism Theme group.
This thesis is made as a case study for an Oulu based indoor activity park. The case company also organizes work welfare activity services for business customers. The objective of this thesis is to determine what kind of work well-being activities companies in Oulu region organizes. Another objective is to find out what are the key issues the case company needs to pay attention to in order to be able to provide attractive services for companies. It was also wanted to examine companies expectations towards the benefits that can be achieved by organizing work welfare activity days. Work welfare is the competitive tool which creates financial performance. Work well-being must be considered from the perspective of profitability of the business so that its effects can be utilized in the best possible way. In this thesis the work welfares impacts on competitiveness were examined through three main players: productivity and cost-efficiency, quality of work and customer satisfaction, and intangible assets. .Another part of the theory consist of the factors affecting work well-being from the individual and organizational point of view. There has been used Rauramos five steps of work well-being- model examines the basic needs with respect of work. The research method used in this thesis is quantitative semi-structured research. It was conducted as a questionnaire which was sent to the respondents via e-mail. Smaller companies had bigger budgets and they organize more often work welfare activity days which last one day. The companies were interested in organizing work welfare activity days in the future as well as having new experiences. Comfortable environment was found out to be the most important factor when choosing a place where to organize work welfare days. The importance of evening program and wide range of options emerged. Companies believed that work welfare has an impact on the companys success. Relaxation, elevating team spirit and work motivation were found to be the key objectives. The company should focus on smaller companies since they have bigger budgets. Investing in websites is important since companies find information online. The work well-being activity days should have a variety of options to choose from since it occurred many times in the study. The opportunity for evening program was found to be important. The activities uplifting team spirit are worth investing in since it occurred many times in the study.

"In the 1970s, Xerox pioneered the involvement of social science researchers in technology design and in developing better ways of working. The Xerox legacy is a hybrid methodology that combines an ethnographic interest in direct observation in settings of interest with an ethnomethodological concern to make the study of interactional work an empirical, investigatory matter. This edited volume is an overview of Xerox's social science tradition. It uses detailed case studies that show how the client engagement was conducted over time and how the findings were consequential for business impact. Case studies in retail, production, office, and home settings cover four topics: practices around documents, the customer front, learning and knowledge-sharing, and competency transfer. The impetus for this book was a 2003 Xerox initiative to transfer knowledge about how to conduct ethnographically grounded work-practice studies to its consultants so that they may generate the kinds of knowledge generated by the researchers themselves"--
