Human Y-chromosomal variation in European populations
The wide-ranging Eurasian common lizard Zootoca vivipara (Lichtenstein, 1823) is remarkably uniform morphologically but highly varied in its karyotype. Previous studies have revealed two distinctly different chromosomal forms of Z. v. vivipara in the Baltic basin. Moreover, a zone of secondary contact between these forms has been localized on the southern Baltic Sea seashore. Intraspecific karyotype diversity for Z. vivipara and new zones of secondary contact have recently been suggested for other parts of the Baltic Sea seashore. We studied the karyotype of Z. vivipara in central, western and northern parts of Finland. All the individuals karyotyped represented the Russian form of Z. v. vivipara that differs from the western form of the subspecies located at the southern and western Baltic Sea seashore. Together with previous data sets, our results suggest intraspecific karyotype diversity in the northern and northwestern parts of Fennoscandia. The results give support to the hypothesis of Z. vivipara's re-colonization of the Baltic Sea basin. Moreover, the results support the previous observations of Voipio (1961, 1968 and 1969) who has reported variability in the shield pattern of Z. vivipara in the same region.

"Great disparities exist between organisms with regard to the relative ease of chromosomal mutagenesis and manipulation. In Chromosomal Mutagenesis, a team of experts provide a variety of chromosomal manipulation techniques, including insertional gene disruptions, gene knockouts, stimulated homologous recombination techniques and other novel tools, for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and attempt to expand the genetic toolbox beyond model organisms. Following the format of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology(TM) format, each chapter offers step-by-step laboratory instructions, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and cutting-edge, Chromosomal Mutagenesis covers state-of-the-art techniques that are staged to expand, if not revolutionize, genetic analysis in the long neglected and relevant cell types." -- (Back Cover)

"Genetic linkage maps are an increasingly important tool in both fundamental and applied research, enabling the study and deployment of genes that determine important biological traits. This concise introduction to genetic mapping in species with disomic inheritance enables life science graduate students and researchers to use mapping software to produce more reliable results. After a brief refresher on meiosis and genetic recombination, the steps in the map construction procedure are described, with explanations of the computations involved. The emphasis throughout is on the practical application of the methods described; detailed mathematical formulae are avoided and exercises are included to help readers consolidate their understanding. A chapter on recognising and solving problems provides valuable guidance for dealing with real-life situations. An extensive chapter dedicated to the more complex situation of outbreeding species offers a unique insight into the approach required for many economically important and model species, both plants and animals"--Provided by publisher.
