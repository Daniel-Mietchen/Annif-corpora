The Case Against Noam Chomsky - Mental Processing The Case Against Noam Chomsky and Mental Processing, volumes one and two of A Biological Philosophy, are about philosophy, cognitive psychology, and linguistics. The first volume presents the theory of speech as interpretation of feelings and language as a social practice. In linguistics this distinction has not been made leading to great confusion in the science. The second volume describes how feelings are created in mental processes (complex, high-speed neural processes) as a function of an individual (unconsciously and consciously) interpreting himself in relation to the environment. - The first volume is presented as a case against Chomsky in view of Chomsky's theories offering a complete contrast to the ideas of a biological philosophy in all its aspects.

The study of conceptual change traces its heritage to the notions of paradigm (networks of shared beliefs, concepts, practices) and paradigm shift made famous by Thomas Kuhn in his book, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions". Kuhn's work was quickly linked to developmental psychology (how knowledge develops) and to science education (teaching big, new ideas). This book is the first comprehensive review of the conceptual change movement and of the impressive research it has spawned on how knowledge develops and can be taught in different content areas. Because of its interdisciplinary focus chapter authors were instructed to write in a manner comprehensible to researchers and students from different fields.The "International Handbook of Research on Conceptual Change" consists of twenty-seven chapters that clarify the nature of conceptual change research, describes its most important findings and demonstrates their importance for education. It is organized into six sections that include detailed discussions of key theoretical and methodological issues, the roots of conceptual change research in the philosophy and history of science, mechanisms of conceptual change, and learner characteristics. It also contains chapters that describe conceptual change research in the content areas such as physics, astronomy, biology, medicine and health, and history. In this book, a particular focus is given to students' difficulties in learning more advanced and counter-intuitive concepts.
