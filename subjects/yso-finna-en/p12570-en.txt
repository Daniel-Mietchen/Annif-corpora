The First Comprehensive Guide to Educational Interpreting As many as 22,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students are currently enrolled in local school programs where their access to the language of learning is dependent upon an interpreter. This book brings together comprehensive information about the practice of interpreting in educational settings. As the author points out, the field of educational interpreting has developed quickly in recent years, creating the need for this practical guide to serve as a resource for interpreters, general education teachers, special education teachers, special education directors, parents, speech-language pathologists, school administrators, and others concerned with the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The book takes a developmental approach to curriculum and instruction regarding students who use interpreters, moving from preschool on through the graduate school. The topics covered relate to the specific needs of learners at each age and apply to interpreters who use sign language, cued speech, and oral interpreting. Each section is presented in a question-answer format, with an emphasis on the challenges posed by interpreting in educational setting and the practices best suited to meeting those challenges. For each of the educational settings, engaging case studies focus on real-life situations and are followed by suggested best-practice solutions as well as questions for further thought.

From the early days of interpreting studies, the notion of quality has attracted the interest of professionals, trainers and scholars alike. Recent years have witnessed a considerable increase in the number of publications on quality, and the continued activity of both individual scholars and research groups testify to the liveliness of this area of research. In the course of this process, research on interpreting quality has become more interdiscilinary and technically sophisticated, widening its scope to cover new interpreting settings and language combinations. This volume attempts to provide an overview of the state of the art in interpreting quality.

This report presents the findings on the number and distribution of BSL/English interpreters and interpreter agencies in England, Scotland and Wales using survey data collected during 1999. It describes the qualifications and skills of BSL/English interpreters and the organisation of the service provided by interpreters and interpreter agencies. In addition to a survey of interpreters and interpreting agencies, the researchers conducted interviews and held public meetings with deaf people and hearing organisations that used BSL/English interpreting services to examine their demand for BSL/English interpreting services and their experience of the service provided. It is estimated that there are between 28,000 and 70,000 deaf people who use BSL as their first or preferred language. This report does not address other sign languages or other means of communication used by deaf or hearing impaired people.
The needs of the deaf and deaf-blind people who use sign language and pressure from their own organizations have been the stimulus for getting interpreting services going on society's cost. The interpreting services for deaf and deaf-blind people is based on the Services and Assistance for the Disabled Act, 1988. In the beginning , interpreting services meant interpreting in sign language for the deaf and deaf-blind people; for the deaf-blind people also other means of interpreting were allowed. Nowadays the interpreting services have been enlarged to aid also deafened people who don't know sign language, but who can use for instance written communications in the interpreting situation. The persons with speech difficulties can use interpreting services according to their individual needs.
