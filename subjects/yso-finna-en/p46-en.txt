The workshop received presentations of the Frame Survey methods used in Zimbabwe and Zambia which included data analysis, fish taxonomy, socio-economics and fish diseases. A number of areas of concern regarding harmonization of methodology between the two countries were identified and the workshop made recommendations on improving the Frame Survey in Lake Kariba.--Publisher's description.

The FAO Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) Project TCP/BiH/3101 "Strengthening Aquaculture Health Management", implemented between late 2006 and mid-2009, was aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the State Veterinary Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina on aquatic animal health management to support sustainable and healthy aquaculture production of the country. In this way, Bosnia and Herzegovina will improve the value and efficiency of aquaculture production through the implementation of international aquatic animal health and food safety standards, especially those of its trading partners in Europe. The project developed national policies on aquatic animal health and strengthened the capacity of veterinary administration, inspectors, laboratories and producers in improving compliance with international health and food safety and quality requirements and practices. The project also assisted in disseminating the lessons learned to neighbouring trading partners in order to promote future regional cooperation in aquaculture and aquatic animal health management. This publication, one of the major documentation outputs of the above TCP, contains a series of seven contributed papers that were presented by national consultants and international experts to participants attending the series of workshops organized by the project. These papers contain information on: (i) project overview and highlights of implementation; (ii) development of national policy and strategy for aquaculture; (iii) European Union animal health requirements for aquacultured animals and their products; (iv) status of national aquaculture development; (v) aquatic animal health surveillance and disease control system in Bosnia and Herzegovina; (vi) national health status of aquatic animals and (vii) aquacultured fish and fishery product quality and safety in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
