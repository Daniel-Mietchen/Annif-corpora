sensor network, using Wi-Fi. The system consists of Wi-Fi based sensor modules to access bio-medical signals from patients and send the data to a remote server via Wi-Fi access point or router. The server updates the database in real-time. The webserver application accesses data from the database and updates the webpage in the form of live streaming graphs like ECG (Electrocardiography).

Defoliation (crown thinning) is widely used as a rapid method of tree condition assessment. As a method that is based on subjective visual observation it might be influenced by statistically significant observer bias. Significant observer bias has been discovere in some countries. We analyzed the significance of observer bias occurring in the Finland's forest condition monitoring system. We analysed the data of three training courses held to the field personnel (2006, 2007, 2008). Our results indicate that some inconsistencies occur between observers, but these are still not systematic in nature. In conclusion, the detected observer biases are independent incidents, caused mainly by the observer perception during the single events. Therefore there is no need to make any systematic corrections for Finnish national visual tree defoliation assessments. We suggest that the best way to improve field assessments is the proper education and guidance of field personnel.

Wärtsilä has provided a Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) service to its own power plant and marine engine applications for several years now. The CBM service is continuously  developed and because of future emission legislation (IMO TIER III 2016), demand for Wärtsilä dual fuel (DF) engines is increasing. Over 300 W50DF engines are in operation at the moment  of which over 200 are marine applications. The goal of this thesis was to develop the present CBM monitoring and reporting more specified to W50DF engine type by improving the contents of the report. This is based on the customer's demand to optimize maintenance intervals. The thesis begins with a theoretical background of the CBM operation in general and the basic working principles of a W50DF engine. The economic value of the CBM for customer is also inspected in the theory part. The Wärtsilä CBM operation is described; how it is utilized now and  what can be improved. The development project was carried out by interviewing W50DF technical service experts, circulating an example CBM report in the W50DF department and  taking into account the customer feedback. The requisite number of measurement points to analyze W50DF was defined and focusing of limit values was done as well. In the process, a  formula for the calculated turbocharger parameter was developed which can be implemented easily to the system. A great part of this work was the improvement of long-term engine  performance follow-up and ways it could be executed as an automatic function with the present CBM technology. Performance follow-up with certain load levels can be implemented by  adjusting the current software but an agreement with the customer is needed to realize the correct load points. An example CBM report was made for a W50DF engine where all the new  features and improvement proposals with explanations were included.  With these improvements and changes, the condition evaluation and monitoring of the W50DF engine can be done more inclusively and the basis for the extension of maintenance intervals is easier to present.

This third book in the series focuses in particular on Article 33 of the CRPD. National implementation and monitoring is analysed and good examples are presented from the different stakeholders involved in the process; from the view of the decision makers, to the independent monitoring organisations and civil society organisations (Disabled People’s Organisations, DPOs), both at European and national level. The diverse chapters represent a range of disciplines and professionals. Their backgrounds span from political and institutional stakeholders and representatives, to academic scholars and NGO representatives. In particular, the authors explore how the rights enshrined in Article 33 are applicable to deaf and hard of hearing citizens, and how they are involved in the process of assuring that the CRPD is implemented in the best way possible.

Traditional in situ surface water sampling produces accurate information on water chemistry and biology. Such sampling is conducted primarily as part of water quality monitoring programmes. If sufficiently consistent, the once collected water quality data could also provide valuable resources for subsequent use in scientific research and long-term monitoring. We examined the spatial and temporal coherence of the archived data resources stored in the environmental information system of the Finnish Environmental Administration (the Hertta-PIVET register). We used phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and primary productivity data collected during 1971-2006 as sample resources for environmental studies on the highly fragmented SW coast of Finland (Northern Baltic Sea). 733 sampling stations were categorized according to the total number of sampling days, the consistence of sampling, the number of representative years and the continuity of sampling. Considerable spatial and temporal inconsistencies were observed, making the accumulated data resources rather unsuitable for many types of environmental studies. Synchronization of sampling activities could improve the representativeness of spatial and temporal coverage of regional sampling. Strategic planning of sampling is required to achieve more concerted data generation activities and to facilitate long-term spatially representative analyses.
