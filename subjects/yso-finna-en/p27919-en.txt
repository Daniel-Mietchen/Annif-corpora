The birth partner : a complete guide to childbirth for dads, doulas, and other labor companions
"Since the original publication of The Birth Partner in 1989, new mothers' mates, friends, and relatives and doulas (professional birth assistants) have relied on Penny Simkin's guidance in caring for the new mother from the last few weeks of pregnancy through the early postpartum period. Fully revised in its third edition, The Birth Partner remains the definitive guide for preparing to help a woman through childbirth and the essential manual to have at hand during the event. For the partner who wishes to be truly helpful in the birthing room, this book is indispensable"--From publisher.
