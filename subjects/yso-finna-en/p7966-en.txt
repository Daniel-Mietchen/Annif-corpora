Immoral tales : European sex and horror movies 1956-1984
"This volume investigates the horror genre across national boundaries (including locations such as Africa, Turkey, and post-Soviet Russia) and different media forms, illustrating the ways that horror can be theorized through the circulation, reception, and production of transnational media texts. Perhaps more than any other genre, horror is characterized by its ability to be simultaneously aware of the local while able to permeate national boundaries, to function on both regional and international registers. The essays here explore political models and allegories, questions of cult or subcultural media and their distribution practices, the relationship between regional or cultural networks, and the legibility of international horror iconography across distinct media. The book underscores how a discussion of contemporary international horror is not only about genre but about how genre can inform theories of visual cultures and the increasing permeability of their borders." -- Publisher website.

"In Undead in the West: Vampires, Zombies, Mummies, and Ghosts on the Cinematic Frontier, Cynthia J. Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper have assembled a collection of essays that explore the many tropes and themes through which undead Westerns make the genre's inner plagues and demons visible, and lay siege to a frontier tied to myths of strength, ingenuity, freedom, and independence. The volume is divided into three sections: "Reanimating Classic Western Tropes" examines traditional Western characters, symbolism, and plot devices and how they are given new life in undead Westerns; "The Moral Order Under Siege" explores the ways in which the undead confront classic values and morality tales embodied in Western films; and "And Hell Followed with Him" looks at justice, retribution, and retaliation at the hands of undead angels and avenger. The subjects explored here run the gamut from such B films as Curse of the Undead and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula to A-list features like From Dusk 'til Dawn and Jonah Hex, as well as animated films (Rango) and television programs (The Walking Dead and Supernatural). Other films discussed include Sam Raimi's Bubba Ho-Tep, John Carpenter's Vampires, George Romero's Land of the Dead, and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Featuring several illustrations and a filmography, Undead in the West will appeal to film scholars, especially those interested in hybrid genres, as well as fans of the Western and the supernatural in cinema."--Publisher description.

"The Horror Genre: From Beelzebub to Blair Witch provides a comprehensive introduction to the history and key themes of the horror film, the main issues and debates surrounding the genre, and the approaches and theories that have been applied to horror texts. In addressing the evolution of the horror film in social and historical context, Paul Wells explores how it has reflected and commented upon particular historical periods, and questions how the horror movie may respond to the new millennium by focusing on the uncharted horizons opened out by recent innovations in the genre's development."--BOOK JACKET.

In one volume, the BFI Companion to Horror offers a complete concordance to one of the most lasting genres of popular entertainment, focusing of course on the cinema but also taking in literature, television, radio, popular music, history and folklore. Covering great artists like Boris Karloff and Edgar Allan Poe and humble toilers like Edward D. Wood and John Carradine, this book provides a history of the horror genre from its pre-cinema beginnings in the eighteenth-century gothic novel and the Victorian ghost story through a hundred years of fevered activity, spotlighting not only mainstream horror producers such as Hammer Films and Alfred Hitchcock but also less expected names (Franz Kafka and Ingmar Bergman). In addition to entries on actors, directors, writers and technicians associated with horror, and all horror-themed film and television series, there are insightful essays on classic horror characters like Frankenstein and Dracula, on recurrent situations like decapitation and body-snatching, even on often-horrific portions of the body like eyes and brains. Among the experts who have contributed are Mark Ashworth, Anne Billson, Jeremy Clarke, Christopher Frayling, Neil Gaiman, Phil Hardy, Peter Hutchings, Tom Hutchinson, Alan Jones, Stephen Jones, Mark Kermode, Tim Lucas, Maitland McDonagh, David Prothero, Mark Salisbury, Philip Strick, Steve Thrower and Linda Ruth Williams.

THE GREAT BOOK OF MOVIE MONSTERS
Heartland Ghost
"The first academic study of the genre of animal horror cinema is essential for cinema and animal studies scholars as well as for fans of horror film. It defines this popular sub-genre, outlines its history and studies recent films as well as cult classics from a variety of perspectives. A central idea in the book is that animal horror cinema mirrors socially entrenched fears of and attitudes toward animals. Thus, animal horror cinema reveals attitudes toward the fabric of social life, the fragility of the eco-system and a deep uncertainty about what makes humans different from animals. The book contains chapters by scholars with different national and disciplinary backgrounds, and therefore offers a wide range of interpretations on the significance of the animal in modern horror film"--
