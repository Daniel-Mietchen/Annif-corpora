Researching customer satisfaction and loyalty : how to find out what people really think
The objective of the study was to clarify the grade of the client company- brand awareness in Russia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The purpose of the thesis was to determine how the consumers in Russia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would react to the company's brand change and in which way the implementation of a new brand should be done in Baltic Rim countries outlook-wise. The theoretical framework covered the most relevant issues of marketing research and branding. The empirical study was conducted by a questionnaire. The questionnaires were sent to the company's customers in Russia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in the summer of 2008 by email. The number of sent questionnaires was 88 in total.     The questionnaires provided information on the present situation of the company's brand in the countries in question. The findings showed that the awareness of the new brand is fairly weak in almost all of the countries, and the awareness of the old brand is weak in some of the countries. The conclusions were based on the results. Recommendations were given for the company's decisions makers on what method would be recommended to be used in the brand implementation in each of the countries based on the analysis of the results derived from the questionnaire, as well as on the theory used. The further research chapter suggests further research topics and recommended courses of actions.
