The purpose of this study was to gather existing information about experienced stroke patient carers' perspectives on the support and educational needs required during the rehabilitation phase of stroke patients. The aim of the study was to create an educational and easy-to-read booklet for stroke patient carers, which covers coping strategies they may apply in their everyday lives. In addition, the aim was to increase nurses' understanding of the difficulties stroke patient carers face during the rehabilitation phase.    This Functional Bachelor's thesis was produced as project work. The project was conducted in close co-operation with nurses from rehabilitation ward of Hatanpään Puisto Hospital. The experiences of stroke patient carers, as detailed in research studies, form the basis of the information provided in the booklet.     The booklet provides stroke patient carers with information, education, and support. It also highlights aspects that experienced stroke patient carers found important in patient care. This booklet is produced for the rehabilitation ward in Hatanpään Puisto Hospital. Nurses in the hospital environment can assess the effectiveness of this information. Such information may ease new stroke patient carers' lives, give deeper understanding of the changes that may exist, and facilitate a quicker adaptation to their new roles.        Key words: stroke patient carers, project, an educational booklet.
