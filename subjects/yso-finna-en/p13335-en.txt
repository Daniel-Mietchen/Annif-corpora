"Yoga is for everyone--not just the young and lithe! If your image of yoga consists of super-flexible bodies contorting themselves into pretzel-like positions, Anna Guest-Jelley offers a much-needed antidote. She understands what it's like trying to force yourself into poses that won't take and feeling short of breath. So she created Curvy Yoga, a worldwide phenomenon that embraces real bodies of all shapes and sizes. She rolls out a practical and welcoming introduction to the ancient practice, along with personal stories of growth, classes gone awry, clueless gurus, and the shocking fat-shaming that pervades the yoga scene. Photographs throughout make it easy to follow each pose"--
