PM10 means particulate matter where each particle has a diameter of 10 μm or less. PM10 not only  correlates strongly with residents' disease, cancer and death, but is also relevant to global climate  change, atmospheric photochemical smog, acid deposition and ozone depletion and other major issues.  (赵琦,2007: 4)  This investigation was implemented by Tampere University of Applied Sciences and Environmental  Services of Tampere during May 2009. The area for the experiment was HÄRMÄLÄ. This final thesis will  concentrate on one specific week's data from May 11th to May 17th 2009.  After analysing it, we will predicate possible reasons which lead to PM10 pollution in order to improve  measurement methods and also improve the software and applications in the ELPI (Electrical Low  Pressure Impactor) machine. However, we collected and organized half a year's data.  In our project, we analyzed the mass concentration of PM10 measured by ELPI (Electrical Low Pressure  Impactor) affected by the number of combustion sources( sauna and wood heating as well as other  heating methods) in different blocks in the HÄRMÄLÄ area.  The data handling processes mainly require a high standard of Excel graphical presentation skills. And it  also needs innovation methods with a knowledge of physics, math, and software skills. All the data  handling processes in my thesis use Excel and other software tools instead of a calculator. So the  results are quite accurate. The appendix will not be published, because the information is confidential.  Due to limited time, there might be mistakes and errors. I appreciate that the reader could provide advice  and suggestions. And I would like to discuss any topic related to my final thesis.  My email address: zhouyou1227@hotmail.com
