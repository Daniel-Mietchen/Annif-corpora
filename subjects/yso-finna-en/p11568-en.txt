The research aims and questions of this thesis are for the thesis commissioner to learn how to establish himself as a professional musician. The questions facilitating the process are 1) What is the present musician like?, 2) What is the future musician like? and 3) What are the roles of branding a product or service and communicating this? The research theory base is on the authors' expertise and understanding of the music industry. The comparison between present situation and future vision is handled by focusing on branding and communication as viable tools to further facilitate the research process. Based on the theory, a toolkit was formed to serve as a basis for the interviews. The research method consisted of two qualitative interviews and personal experiences of a musician's life. Research findings were compiled into a toolkit and presented to appropriate interview subjects in order to gain professional insight as to their effectiveness. The research findings based on the interviews offered personal viewpoints regarding the toolkit suggestions. The interviewees' existing situations as professional musicians and the theoretical structure of the toolkit serves as the basis of the findings, finally leading towards the authors' conclusion.The author's conclusions determine that the subject of the commissioning company is effectively already established professionally. Comparison between the interviewees and the thesis commissioners own situation offer many similarities. The commissioners current situation within the industry reflects that of a moderately successful independent artist, with a global fanbase reaching all corners of the world. The theoretical base serves to enlighten the author to the conclusion that branding and communication are effective tools in further strengthening this position. Furthermore, since the industry has changed, the thesis commissioners' current position within the industry should be considered as that of a professional in relation to musical competence, business understanding and standard of sound recordings.

"Song publishing is the one constant in the carousel of recorded music now spanning the past century, and has been the way that song-credits and publishing revenue have caused ructions and recriminations, and inspired writers by making them poor and lawyers rich. Whether it be Procul Harum going to court to decide who really wrote 'Whiter Shade of Pale' or the Moody Blues wanting their fair share of 'Nights of White Satin', when the song-credits get divvied up, a parting of the ways citing 'musical differences' is almost inevitable. So here are some choice examples of poplore held up to the light, some familiar to music fans others not, designed to prove that Dylan knew of what he wrote when he suggested, 'Money doesn't talk, it swears'. Between them, they provide the unvarnished story of popular song from the days jukeboxes and radio replaced wax cylinders and piano rolls to the era of digital downloads, legal and illegal..."--Publisher's description.

As twin agents of creative expression, fashion and music have long shared a powerful mutual attraction: from the Sex Pistols to Madonna, Kylie Minogue to Lady Gaga, fashion has consistently amplified our understanding of the band (and in many cases the brand) – fuelling the fantasy, giving context to the sound and adding depth to artists' wider agendas. From pop videos to editorial shoots, via the evolution of some of the industry's most significant and era-defining pairings/collaborations, this book focuses on the power of fashion as a make-or-break tool within the music industry's creative process – making it an essential reference point for anyone interested in fashion's role as a medium with which to innovate, communicate and build enduring brands.
