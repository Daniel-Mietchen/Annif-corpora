"The Transnational in English Literature examines English literary history through its transnational engagements and argues that every period of English Literature can be examined through its global relations. English identity and nationhood is therefore defined through its negotiation with other regions and cultures. The first book to look at the entirety of English literature through a transnational lens, Pramod Nayar: - Maps the discourses that constitute the global in every age, from the Early Modern to the twentieth century - Offers readings of representative texts in poetry, fiction, essay and drama, covering a variety of genres such as Early Modern tragedy, the adventure novel, the narrative poem, Gothic and utopian fiction - Examines major authors including Shakespeare, Defoe, Behn, Swift, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Austen, Mary Shelley, the Brontes, Doyle, Ballantyne, Orwell, Conrad, Kipling, Forster - Looks at themes such as travel and discovery, exoticism, mercantilism, commodities, the civilisational mission and the multiculturalization of England. Useful for students and academics alike this book offers a comprehensive survey of the English canon questioning and analysing the transnational and global engagements of English literature. Pramod K. Nayar teaches English at the University of Hyderabad, India"--

This thesis is written as an assignment for Bellcrest Translations Ltd. There was no requirement for any specific subject, so on the basis of interest in British culture, English humour was chosen as the subject. The objective of the thesis is to understand English culture and humour, and how humour appears in its various forms in English everyday life and communication. The thesis is not about comedy. One of the aims is the usefulness of the thesis to those leaving for England, for example, to study or work. The thesis is mainly based on written material. Interviews and email messages have been used as empirical material; they have been studied to learn about English humour and the forms in which it appears. Personal observation is used in addition to these.  The study was started in spring 2007; the interviews were made during the spring and summer 2007, and the email messages are also from that period. Other material has been gradually processed from spring 2007 to spring 2009.  Humour is very important part of English culture and English everyday life and communication. There are various types of humour. It may be difficult for a foreigner to understand English humour, but understanding it is very important part of adapting to English culture.

Gill Plain presents this study of masculinity, national identity and the screen persona of the actor John Mills.
If a nation is a group of people with a sense of kinship, a political identity and representative institutions, then the English have a claim to be the oldest nation in the world. This account gives us the history of the English people, and of how the stories they have told about themselves have shaped them, from the prehistoric times onwards.

"Nation and Nurture in Seventeenth-Century English Literature connects changing seventeenth-century English views of maternal nurture to the rise of the modern nation, especially between 1603 and 1675. Maternal nurture gains new prominence in the early modern cultural imagination at the precise moment when England undergoes a major paradigm shift -- from the traditional, dynastic body politic, organized by organic bonds, to the post-dynastic, modern nation, comprised of symbolic and affective relations. The book also demonstrates that shifting early modern perspectives on Judeo-Christian relations deeply inform the period's interlocking reassessments of maternal nurture and the nation, especially in the case of Milton. The book's five chapters analyze a wide range of reformed and traditional texts, including A pitiless Mother, William Gouge's Of Domesticall Duties, Shakespeare's Macbeth, Charles I's Eikon Basilike, and Milton's Paradise Lost, and Samson Agonistes. Equal attention is paid to such early modern visual images as The power of women (a late sixteenth-century Dutch engraving), William Marshall's engraved frontispiece to Richard Braithwaite's The English Gentleman and Gentlewoman (1641), and Peter Paul Rubens's painting of Pero and Cimon or Roman Charity (1630). The book argues that competing early modern figurations of the nurturing mother mediate in politically implicated ways between customary biblical models of English kingship and innovative Hebraic/Puritan paradigms of Englishness."--Publisher's website.
"The term 'conversation' is one of today's jargon terms. This book explores in depth what conversation means in national terms. Its premise is that to be English is to participate in a conversation about the country's history, politics, culture, and society. The conversation changes, of course, but there is also continuity which illustrates a distinct tradition. It is a conversation, the book argues, which requires the plural notion of these Englands rather than the singularity of this England. Englishness, then, is the tone, register, and idiom of it subject matters, its anxieties and certainties, differences, and commonalities. The book explores the English conversation through historical, political, literary, and popular voices and tries to identify the character of contemporary Englishness."--
