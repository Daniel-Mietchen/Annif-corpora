Choices in Deafness, since 1987 the preeminent guide to communication options, is now extensively revised and expanded to provide the complete scope of information parents of children with deafness or hearing loss need. From assessment and diagnosis to medical/audiological treatments, and from the latest types of cochlear implants and procedures to education and technology devices, this new edition presents a balance of research, guidance, and insight from experts and families.Seven new chapters plus an audio CD cover: -Universal Newborn Screening (implemented in 38 states, this required screening detects hearing loss much earlier, and has doubled the number of children found to have hearing loss) Auditory Neuropathy (a cause of hearing loss where the timing of sound is seriously disrupted, and which has only recently been understood) -Genetic Causes of Deafness (describes genetic testing and counseling in light of research that shows over 60% of deafness in children is due to genetic or hereditary causes) -The Transformation of Dreams (explores a shift in emotional outlook experienced by a parent/clinical psychologist upon learning her child is deaf) -Identifying a Program of Excellence (what to look for in an education program for your child in addition to the chosen communication option) -Communication Technology (services and devices that let deaf people communicate via phone, cell phone, Internet,video) -Making It in College (personal accounts of four students about how they communicate and socialize at college) -What Hearing Loss Sounds Like (a seven-minute audio CD depicts what speech sounds like as it simulates how hearing loss can affect pitch, loudness, and timing) As in the previous edition, Choices in Deafness presents five unbiased approaches to communication--Auditory-Verbal, ASL-English Bilingual, Cued Speech, Auditory-Oral, and Total Communication--and provides parents' first-person accounts of what it's like to use a specific method. Reading and resource lists round out this essential guide for parents.

Prospects are changing for individuals with hearing loss. Infants and toddlers discovered to be deaf or hard of hearing can be aided or implanted with state-of-the-art technology, and the people in the children?s lives can learn to enrich and accentuate their access to sound and help them learn to listen. These children can learn more than one spoken language and can learn to read, write, sing, and play musical instruments. Deafness in all its audiogrammatic forms can be treated in one way or another. Unless someone chooses deafness for a particular child, no child needs to remain in silence or even in partial sound. This book is about learning to listen and speak in order to learn to read and write. It deals with the evidence of persistent low literacy levels in many individuals with hearing loss and with evidence of higher literacy levels in those with hearing loss who have learned to listen. At a time when technology is racing along to produce ever better access to sound, this book attempts to pull together the dominant literacy research done in the ?hearing world? and apply it to the world of the deaf and hard of hearing who can now experience all sorts of sound. The author makes the argument that helping a child learn to listen is the best insurance that he or she will learn to read and write. It comes from both a research-based and a personal point of view.

Literacy Theories for the Digital Age insightfully brings together six essential approaches to literacy research and educational practice. The book provides powerful and accessible theories for readers, including Socio-cultural, Critical, Multimodal, Socio-spatial, Socio-material and Sensory Literacies. The brand new Sensory Literacies approach is an original and visionary contribution to the field, coupled with a provocative foreword from leading sensory anthropologist David Howes. This dynamic collection explores a legacy of literacy research while showing the relationships between each paradigm, highlighting their complementarity and distinctions.
Reading Work explores changing understandings of literacy and its place in contemporary workplace settings. It points to new questions and dilemmas to consider in planning and teaching workplace education. By taking a social perspective on literacies in the workplace, this book challenges traditional thinking about workplace literacy as functional skills, and enables readers to see the complexity of literacy practices and their embeddedness in culture, knowledge and action. A mixture of ethnographic studies, analysis, and personal reflections makes these ideas accessible and relevant to a wide range of readers in the fields of adult literacy and language education and helps to bridge the divide between theory and practice in the field of workplace education. Reading Work: Literacies in the New Workplace features: four distinct but related ethnographies of literacy use in contemporary workplaces; a social practice view of literacy brought to the workplace; collaborative research undertaken by experienced workplace educators and academics working in the areas of adult literacy and second language learning; implications chapters for both practice and theory--presented not as a series of steps but rather as reflections by seasoned educators on shared dilemmas; and engaging, accessible writing that encourages workplace practitioners to read, learn from, and do their own research.

The workshop was organized as part of the preparatory phase of the research project The development of Communication and Linguistic Competence in Deaf and Deaf-blind Children. The contributors to the book have their backgrounds in education, psychology, linguistics, and sociology. Some are primarily researchers, others are primarily practitioners in the fields of deaf education and deaf-blind education. The book addresses itself primarily to everybody who takes an interest in the communicative and educational issues concerning deafness and/or deaf-blindness. Some of the papers take a more general perspective on these issues.
Dyslexia, literacy and inclusion / Child-centred perspectives
"This book studies everyday writing practices among ordinary people in a poor rural society in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using the abundance of handwritten material produced, disseminated and consumed some centuries after the advent of print as its research material, the book's focus is on its day-to-day usage and on 'minor knowledge,' i.e., text matter originating and rooted primarily in the everyday life of the peasantry"--Provided by publisher.

Literacy/Illitteracy in the world : a bibliography
This paper provides an overview of the GraphoGame method. Both theoretical and methodological aspects related to the method are presented. The method's guiding principles are based on the prevailing theories and experimental research findings on learning and teaching basic reading skills in alphabetic languages, especially from the point of view of a struggling reader. Because the nature of the target language and its relation to its writing system play central roles in the GraphoGame method, this approach requires the method to be flexible in order to be valid for learners of different languages and orthographies. Thus, the aim of the developed technology is to provide an appropriate reading support tool for all learners‚Äîfrom struggling learners to typical learners‚Äîin any language environment. We present an overview of results gained from GraphoGame intervention studies as well as challenges for the usability of the method.

The teaching of reading - without really any method : an analysis of reading instruction in Denmark
This study investigated how the use of an online reading game differs in home and school environments. First and second graders (N = 194) participated in an 8-week training during which they used the reading program GraphoGame either at home or at school under the supervision of parents or teachers. Child participants were recommended by parents and teachers recruited from the list of GraphoGame users, and adults decided whether the training took place at home or at school. We measured the frequency and duration of playing, children's engagement, development of reading skill and reading interest, and adult supportive involvement. The results revealed that children who played GraphoGame at school showed higher engagement and used it more frequently than players at home. Although teachers were more involved in the children's playing than were parents, only parental involvement was significantly associated with a child's engagement during training and the child's learning outcomes.

The history of the Jesus movement and earliest Christianity requires careful attention to the characteristics and peculiarities of oral and literate traditions. Understanding the distinctive elements of Greco-Roman literacy potentially has profound implications for the historical understanding of the documents and events involved. Concepts such as media criticism, orality, manuscript culture, scribal writing, and performative reading are explored in these chapters. The scene of Greco-Roman literacy is analyzed by investigating writing and reading practices. These aspects are then related to early Christian texts such as the Gospel of Mark and sections from Paul's letters.

One of the foremost authorities on the use of sign language with hearing children provides a guide for teachers and parents who want to introduce signing in hearing children's language development. Marilyn Daniels provides a complete explanation for its use, a short history of sign language and its primary role within the Deaf community, an identification of the steps to reading success delineated with suggestions for incorporating sign language, and the results of studies and reactions of children, teachers, and parents. She shows how sign language can be used to improve hearing children's English vocabulary, reading ability, spelling proficiency, self-esteem, and comfort with expressing emotions. Signing also facilitates communication, aids teachers with classroom management, and has been shown to promote a more comfortable learning environment while initiating an interest and enthusiasm for learning on the part of students.

"The term 'Multiliteracies' was coined in 1994 by the New London Group, a group of scholars who came together to consider the current state and possible future of literacy pedagogy. In the subsequent years, the influence of the idea has been greater than the members of the group could ever have imagined. In this collection, two of the original members of the group, Bill Cope and Mary Kalantzis, have brought together a representative range of authors, each of whom has been involved in the application of the pedagogy of Multiliteracies, in settings as broadly dispersed as Australia, Canada, Greece, Malaysia, Italy, Japan, South Africa and the United States. The chapters capture vivid narratives of school experiences and offer insights into the role of the new, digital media platforms such as online lesson planning, resource development, and classroom delivery, making this book an invaluable resource for Multiliteracies practitioners and researchers alike"--

Africa is often depicted as the continent with the lowest literacy rates in the world. Moving beyond this essentialising representation, this volume explores African literacies within their complex and diverse multilingual and multiscriptal histories and contexts of use. The chapters examine contexts from the Maghreb to Mozambique and from Senegambia to the Horn of Africa and critically analyse multiple literacy genres and practices - from ancient manuscripts to instant messaging - in relation to questions of language-in-education and policy, livelihoods, Islamic scholarship, colonialism, translocal migration, and writing systems. As a whole, the book serves as an advanced introduction to language and society in Africa seen through the lens of literacy, and marks a unique contribution to scholarship in literacy studies offering a convenient collection of perspectives on and from Africa.

This text provides future and practicing teachers of deaf children with basic theoretical and research knowledge as well as specific principles and practices for fostering the development of language and reading. In this third edition of Language Learning Practices with Deaf Children, the authors have added a section on language assessment in Chapter 7 addressing high-stakes or large-scale testing and a new chapter on special programs, including ASL√êEnglish programs for children from multicultural homes and technology for language learning. An Appendix has been added with an annotated list of Internet Web sites that may be useful to teachers, parents, and preservice teachers as well as others interested in language practices with children who are deaf. Language Learning Practices with Deaf Children describes the variety of language development theories and practices that are used with deaf children, without advocating any particular approach. Chapters 1 and 2 cover some of the accepted facts and known problems of language acquisition and instruction with hearing and with deaf children. Implications for language development in deaf children are discussed. Chapter 3 is a history of instructional practices in language development with deaf children to show continuity between present and past practices and to illustrate the recurring cycles of major language development approaches with deaf children. Chapters 4, 5, and 8 detail the major approaches of the present time: natural methods, structural methods, and American Sign Language-English as a second language (ASL√êESL) as well as specialized programs for children from multicultural homes and technology as part of language learning. Chapter 6 discusses reading and writing, and Chapter 7 focuses on the assessment of language and progress monitoring of language development among school-aged children. Finally, Chapter 9 offers some reflection on the material in the book.

The 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) witnessed revolutionary exchanges on the vital themes in education. Presenters addressed topics encompassing seven major strands: Educational Environments, Language and Literacy, Early Intervention, Unique Challenges in Developing Countries, Educating Learners with Diverse Needs, Technology in Education, and Sign Language and Deaf Culture. These presentations and ensuing dialogues raised many complex questions. Partners in Education: Issues and Trends from the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf features all of the keynote addresses by renowned luminaries in deaf education: Breda Carty, Karen Ewing, Nassozi Kiyaga, John Luckner, Connie Mayer and Beverly Trezek, volume editor Donald F. Moores, Peter V. Paul, Antti Raike, Claudine Storbeck, James Tucker, and Alys Young. Most critically, the contributors to this collection explore the many multifaceted challenges facing the world¬ís deaf students. Deaf children are being diagnosed with overlays of disabilities; more deaf children are growing up in poverty; and many deaf children represent minority racial/ethnic groups or are immigrants to their country of residence. The situation for deaf individuals in the most impoverished countries of the world is desperate and of crisis proportions. This volume brings these themes to light through its exceptional synthesis of the outstanding discourse that took place at ICED 2010, including abstracts from 30 celebrated conference presentations.

This paper reports findings from the study that examined the role of family in children's acquisition of early reading skills. We recruited 72 first-grade learners and their parents from low-income Zambian families for the study. In response to a home literacy questionnaire, parents reported on their reading attitudes and family literacy environment. Children's early reading skills were assessed using two early reading tests (orthographic awareness and decoding competence), both conducted at two different points during the year. Regression analyses of pretest and gain scores revealed that parental reading attitude and family literacy environment significantly predicted early reading skills. These findings suggest that the family is an important element in the children's process of learning to read. Implications of the findings are discussed.

The convergence of two complementary agendas motivated collaboration between two universities (in Zambia and Finland) to establish the Centre for the Promotion of Literacy in Sub-Saharan Africa (CAPOLSA), focused on initial literacy learning in indigenous languages. The project's mandate and activities are closely related to Zambia's national context of literacy and educational provision, emerging trends in information and communication technology, and the University of Zambia's institutional context of research and development on literacy, child development, and education. CAPOLSA has afforded opportunities for enhancing the working relations between the national university and government and for contributing to the development of institutional linkages and consultative forums. Collaboration between various disciplines, institutions, and economic sectors characterizes CAPOLSA's activities. Important areas of progress envisaged include institutional development, growth of a sustainable community of researchers whose collective efforts will increase the scale of Africa's contribution to international knowledge, and evidence-based planning at the interface between humans and technology.

With rapid technological and cultural advancements, the 21st century has witnessed the wide scale development of transnationalist economies, which has led to the concurrent evolution of language and literacy studies, expanding cross-cultural approaches to literacy and communication. Current language education applies new technologies and multiple modes of text to a diverse range of cultural contexts, enhancing the classroom experience for multi-lingual learners. The Handbook of Research on Cross-Cultural Approaches to Language and Literacy Development provides an authoritative exploration of cross-cultural approaches to language learning through extensive research that illuminates the theoretical frameworks behind multicultural pedagogy and its myriad applications for a globalized society. With its comprehensive coverage of transnational case studies, trends in literacy teaching, and emerging instructive technologies, this handbook is an essential reference source for K-20 educators, administrators in school districts, English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers, and researchers in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). This diverse publication features comprehensive and accessible articles on the latest instructional pedagogies and strategies, current empirical research on cross-cultural language development, and the unique challenges faced by teachers, researchers, and policymakers who promote cross-cultural perspectives.
