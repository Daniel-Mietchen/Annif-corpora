"The Handbook of Journal Publishing is a comprehensive reference work written by experienced professionals, covering all aspects of journal publishing, both online and in print. Changes in recent years in the way journals are produced, financed and used make this an especially turbulent and challenging time for journal publishers - and for authors, readers and librarians. The Handbook offers a thorough guide to the journal publishing process, from editing and production through marketing, sales and fulfilment, with chapters on management, finances, metrics, copyright and ethical issues. It provides a wealth of practical tools, including checklists, sample documents, worked examples, alternative scenarios and extensive lists of resources, which readers can use in their day-to-day work. Between them, the authors have been involved in every aspect of journal publishing over several decades and bring to the text their experience working for a wide range of publishers in both the not-for-profit and commercial sectors"--

This book outlines how to undertake a bibliometric study, a topic of vital importance in academic research today. Scientometrics studies scientific productivity and can be applied to all disciplines. Many analyses have been applied in relation to bibliometric studies, but few have shown how to actually carry out the analysis. This book provides a guide on how to develop a bibliometric study, from the first step in which the topic to study has to be set, to the analysis and interpretation. Key features include: a practical and easy to read guide on how to carry out a bibliometric study; gives a wide and up-to-date view about the most common scientometric indexes; and analyses are illustrated with multiple and practical examples about their application. Readership include: Lecturers and graduate students from many disciplines who are interested in carrying out a bibliometric study in their specific area. The book can also be used as a tool for the study of Scientometrics in general. Moreover, it is of interest to researchers who need information about the bibliometric indicators of their area of study and also require a brief guide on how to apply the main analyses of this science.
