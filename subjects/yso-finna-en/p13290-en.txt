Immigrants and employment challenge
In my study the main objective is to show the ways in which immigrants enter the Finnish labor market and  to examine  the extent to which their social networks act as main resources  and  strategies that  help them to locate and  to get hold of  employment  opportunities  and thereby settle down in their country of arrival. The study aims to explore the various job-search methods immigrants have employed and considers the intensity of use and their relative effectiveness. It offers a detailed  investigation into how job information  that facilitates employment  among  immigrants  is acquired  and  disseminated,  how  the  jobs themselves are applied for, and whether their personal contacts play any direct or indirect role in securing  them.  In addition, the study also considers the impact of immigrants' social networks on occupational attainment. The findings of this study show that, regardless of the nationwide  well-established system of public  employment   agencies  in Finland,  and  the  relatively easy  access  this formal channel  offers to job seekers regarding information about  new vacancies,  social networks still constitute  a considerable source  of job information  and  employment  opportunities  for immigrants in the Finnish labor market. The importance of these networks is very much strong  for  non-nationals  who,  because   of  having  originated  from  outside  the  social system, may find access to employment  opportunities  rather limited in the host society.
