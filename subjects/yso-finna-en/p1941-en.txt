"The Sound Studies Reader is a groundbreaking anthology blending recent work that self-consciously describes itself as 'sound studies' with earlier and lesser known scholarship on sound. The collection begins with an introduction to welcome novice readers to the field and acquaint them with key themes and concepts in sound studies. Individual section introductions give readers further background on the essays and an extensive up to date bibliography for further reading in 'sound studies' make this an original and accessible guide to the field."

A philosophic study of non-conceptualized auditory sensations : mental states as functionally interpreted abstract dispositions
"This book aims to convey to engineering students and researchers alike the relevant knowledge about the nature of acoustics, sound and hearing that will enable them to develop new technologies in this area through acquiring a thorough understanding of how sound and hearing works. There is currently no technical book available covering the communication path from sound sources through medium to the formation of auditory events in the brain - this book will fill this gap in the current book literature. It discusses the multidisciplinary area of acoustics, hearing, psychoacoustics, signal processing, speech and sound quality and is suitable for use as a main course textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate courses related to audio communication systems. It covers the basics of signal processing, traditional acoustics as well as the human hearing system and how to build audio techniques based on human hearing resolution. It discusses the technologies and applications for sound synthesis and reproduction, and for speech and audio quality evaluation"--

"Long ignored by scholars in the humanities, sound has just begun to take its place as an important object of study in the last few years. Since the late 19th century, there has been a paradigmatic shift in auditory cultures and practices in European societies. This change was brought about by modern phenomena such as urbanization, industrialization and mechanization, the rise of modern sciences, and of course the emergence of new sound recording and transmission media. This book contributes to our understanding of modern European history through the lens of sound by examining diverse subjects such as performed and recorded music, auditory technologies like the telephone and stethoscope, and the ambient noise of the city"--Provided by publisher.
