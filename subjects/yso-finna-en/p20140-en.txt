Encountering the New Woman : feminist rebellion and literature
In her first book, Felski sets out an ambitious and interesting project: to prove faulty what she sees as the two dominant modes of current feminist literary theory and to suggest, instead, an alternative, more wide-ranging view of what a feminist literary theory might do. Her major premise is that there can be no feminist aesthetic as has developed out of the feminist literature published over the last 20 years, partially because that aesthetic, while purporting to be "other," has been developed out of a normative field of aesthetics. She argues, rather, for a feminist literary theory that admits what she sees as its inextricable bonds with the social and political issues of the wider feminist community. Felski's position is a compelling one, and her discussion of recent women's writing supports her viewpoint admirably. - Jessica Grim, NYPL.

Sexual feelings : reading, affectivity and sexuality in a selection of anglophone Caribbean women's writing
Art today is an increasingly multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing transgressive works that intervene in war, inequalities, ecological disasters, and revolutionary changes in technology. Carnal Aesthetics is a fascinating new examination of this aspect of contemporary visual culture. Employing recent theories of transgressive body imagery, trauma, affectivity and sensation, it provides a fresh look at the meeting point between the politics of representation and the politics of perception, through the prismatic lens of feminist theory. Acclaimed scholars, including Griselda Pollock, Vivian Sobchack, Laura Marks, Erin Manning, Jill Bennett, and Martine Beugnet, analyse seminal case studies coming from different media: digital photography, video, film and multimedia art. They explore a number of transgressive movements that significantly reconfigure the relationship between the body and the image, challenging also the primacy of vision.
How to do theory
The aesthetic subject : exploring the usefulness of Foucauldian tools in feminism
Queer Theory is one of the most contested and intellectually complex movements in contemporary sexual politics. Where did it come from, and what does it do? Is queer theory only for queers? If you have ever wanted to be a leather daddy, been puzzled by performativity, tried to measure bisexuality, or wondered whether Diana, Princess of Wales could be a gay icon, Queer Theory is required reading. This vibrant anthology of groundbreaking work by influential scholars, activists, performers, and visual artists is essential for anyone with an interest in sexuality studies or gender activism. The fifteen articles - including two specially commissioned contributions, as well as an engaging introduction - map, contextualise, and challenge queer theory's project both within and beyond the academy. Helpful critical summaries that link the selections, and suggestions for further reading, make this volume perfect for anyone approaching queer theory for the first time.
The expanding discourse : feminism and art history
Sisters! Making films, doing politics : an exploration in artistic research
The notion of a special intimacy between 'the feminine and the sacred' has received significant attention since the publication of Julia Kristeva and Catherine Clement's famous ecumenical "Conversation" of the same name which focused on the relationship between meaning and the body at whose interface the feminine is positioned. Brought to the wider public as the 'sacred feminine', it has also made its mark on popular culture. Taking up the debate and moving beyond anthropology or theology, writers from varied ethnic, geo-cultural and religious perspectives here join with secular cultural analysts to explore the sacred and the feminine in art, architecture, literature, art history, music, philosophy, theology, critical theory and cultural studies. The book addresses key issues in feminist questions of creativity, the imaginary and the sacred as 'otherness', exploring the ways in which visual practices have explored this rich, contested and highly charged territory.

Feminist aesthetics
A long-needed corrective and alternative view of Western art history, these seventeen essays by respected scholars are arranged chronologically and cover every major period from the ancient Egyptian to the present. While several of the essays deal with major women artists, the book is essentially about Western art history and the extent to which it has been distorted, in every period, by sexual bias.
