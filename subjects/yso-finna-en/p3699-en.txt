Alexandra Stiglmayer interviewed survivors of the continuing war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to reveal, to a seemingly deaf world, the horrors of the ongoing war in the former Yugoslavia. The women - primarily of Muslim but also of Croatian and Serbian origin - have endured the atrocities of rape and the loss of loved ones. Their testimony, published in the 1993 German edition, is bare, direct, and its cumulative effect overwhelming. The first English edition contains Stiglmayer's updates to her own two essays, one detailing the historical context of the current conflict and the other presenting the core of the book, interviews with some twenty victims of rape as well as interviews with three Serbian perpetrators. Essays investi-gating mass rape and war from ethnopsychological, sociological, cultural, and medical perspectives are included.

Built upon the structure and content of the successful first edition (currently in its eighth printing), this second edition of The True Cost of Low Prices: The Violence of Globalization examines the effects of globalization on the earth's poorest and most vulnerable people within the context of scripture and church teaching. The text engages the reader with stories of the women, men, and children living in poverty who have experienced both the promise of the global economy and its troubling outcomes. <p> The nine thematic chapters begin with a story of a person affected by a particular dimension of the violence of globalization. That is followed by a description of the "signs of the times," including the topic's relationship to low prices, and then by "what the church teaches," utilizing the Catechism, the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, papal encyclicals, the documents of Vatican II, and the statements of the U.S. Catholic bishops. Each chapter concludes with "signs of hope," descriptions of groups and strategies that make a difference. Each chapter also includes discussion questions and suggestions for making a difference.
