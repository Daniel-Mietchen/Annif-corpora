Botulinum neurotoxins are the most toxic natural substances and represent a major threat to the population when intentionally released in bioterrorist attacks. On the other hand, during the past two decades botulinum neurotoxins have become established as indispensable drugs for the treatment of a variety of severe neurological disorders. The need for efficient countermeasures as well as the expansion into additional fields of therapeutic application, call for comprehensive information on the botulinum neurotoxin molecules and their mode of action. Our knowledge of this subject has made great strides in recent years, setting the stage for the development of new botulinum neurotoxin-based molecules and novel applications.This book reviews the current status of basic botulinum neurotoxin research. The first part describes the genetic variability of the toxin-producing bacteria, and sheds light on each step from toxin ingestion to the abrogation of synaptic signaling including the intestinal passage and absorption, nerve cell binding and entry, and intracellular substrate cleavage. The remaining chapters detail progress made in detection methods for botulinum neurotoxins, the development of botulinum neurotoxin inhibitors, and strategies to refine the neurotoxins for further medicinal applications by means of recombinant technologies.

White birches (Betula spp.) are utilized in huge quantities in the forest industry in northern latitudes of the world and low-value side-stream birch bark is burnt for energy. Outer birch bark is rich in (up to 30% dry weight) triterpene betulin and it can be easily isolated by solvent extraction. Betulin could be used as such or as starting material for more valuable products, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In this work two sets of betulin derivatives were synthesized and screened as antiviral, antileishmanial and antibacterial agents. First set includes relatively easily synthesizable betulin derivatives, such as esters and various oxidation products. Second set includes novel heterocyclic betulin derivatives, where triazolo ring is fused by Diels-Alder reaction to the lupane skeleton of betulin. In the biological assays against human pathogens Semliki Forest virus; L. donovani parasites, which cause tropical disease leishmaniasis; and Gram-negative bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae, several betulin derivatives displayed low-micromolar 50% growth inhibition values in vitro. In addition, most of the derivatives showed low cytotoxicity against the host cell lines.
