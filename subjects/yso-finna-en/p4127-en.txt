Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common cancers in Finland. Prognostic factors are important for predicting disease outcome and adjusting optimal treatment. The currently used prognostic methods for CRC have their limitations and consequently several biomarkers have been studied to find potential prognostic markers, but none have been adapted for routine use so far. In the present study, the relationships between the components of the immune system and other factors modulating tumor growth were assessed and their suitability to be used for use as prognostic tools in CRC were studied. The study material consisted of blood samples and surgical specimens collected from 148 CRC patients operated on in Oulu University Hospital and blood samples of 86 healthy controls. Concentrations of endostatin and 27 cytokines were measured from preoperative serum samples and control samples. Immunohistochemical methods were used for collagen XVIII and inflammatory cell analyses. The levels of several cytokines were altered in CRC patients compared to the controls. The serum cytokine profile achieved an excellent accuracy in discriminating CRC patients from healthy controls. Advanced CRCs were associated with elevated cytokine levels and a metastasized disease was linked to an orientation towards Th2 cytokine milieu. The presence of systemic inflammation, depicted by a modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), correlated to CRC progression. The serum endostatin levels were elevated in CRC and correlated with invasion through muscular layer and systemic inflammation, but not with densities of local inflammatory cells. Collagen XVIII was expressed in tumor stroma and in the muscle layer of bowel wall.The serum cytokines and tumor infiltrating immune cells showed relatively weak associations.In conclusion, CRC is associated with significant alterations in serum cytokine milieu, wh ich underlines the relevance of studying several cytokines and their relative alterations. The serum cytokine profile is a promising tool for discriminating CRC patients from healthy controls, but its clinical value needs to be validated. The elevated endostatin levels may result from invasion-related cleavage of collagen XVIII in the bowel wall, but further studies are needed to determine the value of endostatin in CRC prognosis.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and type 2 diabetes is reaching a global epidemic. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors and pharmacotherapies in relation to these cardiometabolic diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of these risk factors and drug therapies generally remain incompletely understood. Elucidating the underlying molecular effects would be essential for better understanding of the disease pathogenesis and also for discovering new therapeutic targets. Quantitative serum metabolomics, which allows for simultaneous quantification of multiple circulating metabolic measures, provides a hypothesis-free approach to systematically inspect the metabolic changes in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Metabolomics thus presents a valuable tool to study the detailed molecular effects of disease risk factors and drug therapies. However, current metabolomics studies are mostly conducted in small cross-sectional studies and the causal relations of the risk factors on the metabolic measures are generally unclear, providing limited public health impact. The present thesis serves as a proof-of-concept to illustrate that well-designed observational studies can be used to infer causality. With the exemplars of assessing molecular effects of two risk factors (body mass index and sex hormone-binding globulin) and two drug therapies (statins and oral contraceptives), the thesis demonstrates that an improved causal inference can be achieved in observational studies via the combination of multiple study designs, including cross-sectional, longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analysis. This robust study design approach together with metabolomics data can be also extended to study the molecular effects of other risk factors and drug therapies. With an improved molecular understanding of a wide range of risk factors and therapies, better understanding of disease pathogenesis is ensured.
