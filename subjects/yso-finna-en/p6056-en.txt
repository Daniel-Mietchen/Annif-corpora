Abstract.
"Managing Pupil Behaviour provides routes through the classroom management maze to help practising and aspiring teachers learn to manage behaviour effectively in their classrooms. Using Terry Haydn's unique 10-point scale, it encourages teachers to think about the degree to which they are relaxed and in assured control of their classrooms and can enjoy their teaching. Drawing on the views of over 140 teachers and 700 pupils, it provides insights into the factors which enable teachers to manage learning effectively in their classrooms, so that pupils can learn and achieve, and teachers can enjoy their work. Key issues explored include the factors that influence the working atmosphere in the classroom, the impact of that atmosphere on teaching and learning, and tensions around inclusive practice and situations where some pupils may be spoiling the learning of others. This new edition has been fully updated to take account of recent research and inspection findings and includes a new chapter exploring the wide range of sophisticated skills that expert teachers deploy in order to get pupils to want to learn, and to enable teachers to work in classrooms where the climate is perfect for learning. Managing Pupil Behaviour will help all teachers ensure 'the right to learn' for all the pupils in their care and to think about different ways to approach this vitally important aspect of their working lives"--

Humor in the classroom : a guide for language teachers and educational researchers
Humor in the Classroom provides practical, research-based answers to questions that educational researchers and language teachers might have about the social and cognitive benefits that humor and language play afford in classroom discourse and additional language learning. The book considers the ways in which humor, language play, and creativity can construct new possibilities for classroom identity, critique prevailing norms, and reconfigure particular relations of power. Humor in the Classroom encourages educational researchers and language teachers to take a fresh look at the workings of humor in today's linguistically diverse classrooms and makes the argument for its role in building a stronger foundation for studies of classroom discourse, theories of additional language development, and approaches to language pedagogy.

Have you ever wondered how learning happens? Control in the Classroom introduces the main ideas of a profound explanation of human behavior and then applies these ideas to the issue of curriculum delivery. This illuminating explanation, known as Perceptual Control Theory, shows that control is the fundamental phenomenon at the core of the business of living. Control is critical in the classroom - both for teachers and for students. From this perspective, teaching can be considered to be a process of helping students develop greater control capabilities. The first part of the book introduces the theory in an easy-to-read, light-hearted style. Through an abundance of examples the principles of the theory are applied both to classroom activity and life in general. You might even discover that understanding this theory helps you in other areas of your life, not only in teaching. The second part of the book addresses specific aspects of curriculum delivery such as lesson plans and goal setting. Forms are provided to help you develop expertise in this approach. Examples of completed forms are included as well.
