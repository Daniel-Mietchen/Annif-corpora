The breakthrough of Nokia mobile phones
The goal of this thesis was to develop a wireless communication system for communication between the commissioner DA-Design's TV viewing measurement devices, iMeters. The final product will replace the 433 and 868 MHz Triacon radio modules currently in use. The final product had also to be compatible with the Triacon modules. The project included documenting the programming parameters of the Triacon radio modules. It also included comparing different radio chips on the market, testing the selected chip and range measurements. The project also included electronics design and prototyping. Documentation concerning the product had to be delivered to DA-Design in English, as specified by the commissioner. The radio chip selected for the future radio link was Texas Instruments CC1101. Range measurements with the CC1101 were done indoors and outdoors using the SmartRF04DK development kit. Operation of the Triacon radio modules was researched using a logic analyzer. Compatibility testing between the CC1101 and the Triacon modules was successful. PCB design for the CC1101 was done by DA-Design using as a base the Texas Instruments CC1101EM reference design.

"We think we know everything about our smartphones. We use them constantly. We depend on them for every conceivable purpose. We are familiar with every inch of their compact frames. But there is more to the smartphone than meets the eye. How have smartphones shaped the way we socialize and interact? Who tracks our actions, our preferences, our movements as recorded by our smartphones? These are just some of the questions that journalist Elizabeth Woyke answers in this muckraking expose; of the $241 billion industry that produces more than 700 million devices each year. In the tradition of The Coffee Book, The Sneaker Book, Oil, and Cigarettes, The Smartphone offers not only a step-by-step guide to how smartphones are designed and manufactured but also a bold exploration of the darker side of this massive industry, including the exploitation of labor, the disposal of electronic waste, and the underground networks that hack and smuggle smartphones. Featuring interviews with key figures in the development of the smartphone and expert assessments of the industry's main players--Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung--The Smartphone is the perfect introduction to this most personal of gadgets. Your smartphone will never look the same again. "--
