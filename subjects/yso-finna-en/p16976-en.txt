Housing stocks provide much more than just shelter. Energy suppliers, pension fund managers and public transit providers are but a few of the many stakeholders that have a regulated interest in the non-shelter goods and services offered by housing. Such stakeholders and their activities are traditionally addressed on a sectoral basis, yet regulations that are designed to apply to one often have unintended effects on another, effects that may produce negative pressure on the housing stock – and the wider built environment – in terms of sustainability. Sustainable Collective Housing presents a new and comprehensive approach to the study of the regulations pertaining to housing: the institutional regimes framework. By considering the housing stock as a resource, this framework enables the ensemble of public policies, property rights and contracts that govern all shelter and non-shelter uses of housing to be identified, analyzed and evaluated. Using examples from Switzerland, Germany and Spain, this book describes the regulatory conditions that must be in place before housing sustainability issues can be effectively tackled. The book will provide policy-makers, housing stock owners and other stakeholders with the knowledge and tools to make rational and legitimate decisions regarding housing sustainability.

Housing policy and rented housing in Europe
"Based on empirical research from 15 European cities, covering 29 major postwar housing estates, the contributors to this volume explore the idea that mass housing experiments represent an important example of policy transfer. Mass Housing in Europe charts the development of estates examining the problems that have emerged over time, the policy responses and residents' experiences of day-to-day life in the context of change and regeneration. Students, researchers and academics alike will find that this research provides a significant insight into the topic"--Provided by publisher.

Demand for owner-occupied housing has expanded dramatically across modern-industrialized societies in recent years leading to volatile increases in residential property values. This book explores the rise of modern home-ownership as a cultural, socio-political and ideological phenomenon. There has been a phenomenal growth in owner-occupied housing and rapid increases in house prices across societies in recent decades. Many countries have been overwhelmed by the demand for home ownership, by the aggregate wealth built up in housing property, as well as by the debt bound up in mortgage markets. This book considers how and why home ownership became so significant in various international contexts. A central concept is 'home ownership ideology', which implies that housing practices are not benign but support particular alignments of social-power relations. A complementary concept is that of 'homeowner society', which suggests that social relations in some societies are specifically orientated towards owner-occupied housing systems, which play a role in development pathways. While there has been a growing demand for owner-occupied housing and a substantial augmentation in property values, there has not been a parallel awareness of the wider social impact. The objective in this book is to develop understanding of the role of housing systems, ideologies and practices in emerging social structures.

"In a relevant and cutting edge analysis, this book examines policy-making in Russia as a process of social learning, using the case of housing policy. Centering its study around three explanatory variables - actors, institutions and ideas - it argues that Russia's hybrid institutional environment reduces the competition of policy ideas, both at the stage of policy elaboration by the community of state and non-state policy experts, and also at the stage of policy adoption by parliament. Consequently policies only partially satisfy key societal needs, and require frequent revisions of the paradigmatic basis of policy. The book also highlights the importance of gradual institutional evolution, as a mode of policy development that produces fundamental transformation of policy over time and changes in government which can result in abrupt shift in policy"--
