"Securing against operational interruptions and the theft of your data is much too important to leave to chance. By planning for the worst, you can ensure your organization is prepared for the unexpected. Enterprise Architecture and Information Assurance: Developing a Secure Foundation explains how to design complex, highly available, and secure enterprise architectures that integrate the most critical aspects of your organization's business processes.Filled with time-tested guidance, the book describes how to document and map the security policies and procedures needed to ensure cost-effective organizational and system security controls across your entire enterprise. It also demonstrates how to evaluate your network and business model to determine if they fit well together. The book's comprehensive coverage includes:Infrastructure security model componentsSystems security categorizationBusiness impact analysisRisk management and mitigationSecurity configuration managementContingency planningPhysical securityThe certification and accreditation processFacilitating the understanding you need to reduce and even mitigate security liabilities, the book provides sample rules of engagement, lists of NIST and FIPS references, and a sample certification statement. Coverage includes network and application vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, penetration testing, incident response planning, risk mitigation audits/reviews, and business continuity and disaster recovery planning. Reading this book will give you the reasoning behind why security is foremost. By following the procedures it outlines, you will gain an understanding of your infrastructure and what requires further attention"--

"This book fills a gap between high-level overview texts that are often too general and low-level detail oriented technical handbooks that lose sight the "big picture". This book discusses SOA from the low-level perspective of middleware, various XML-based technologies, and basic service design. It also examines broader implications of SOA, particularly where it intersects with business process management and process modeling. Concrete overviews will be provided of the methodologies in those fields, so that students will have a hands-on grasp of how they may be used in the context of SOA"--

"An Architectural Approach to Instructional Design is organized around a groundbreaking new way of conceptualizing instructional design practice. Both practical and theoretically sound, this approach is drawn from current international trends in architectural, digital, and industrial design, and focuses on the structural and functional properties of the artifact being designed rather than the processes used to design it. Harmonious with existing systematic design models, the architectural approach expands the scope of design discourse by introducing new depth into the conversation and merging current knowledge with proven systematic techniques. An architectural approach is the natural result of increasing technological complexity and escalating user expectations. As the complexity of design problems increases, specialties evolve their own design languages, theories, processes, tools, literature, organizations, and standards. An Architectural Approach to Instructional Design describes the implications for theory and practice, providing a powerful and commercially relevant introduction for all students of instructional design"--

In practice, requirements engineering tasks become more and more complex. In order to ensure a high level of knowledge and training, the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB) worked out the training concept Certified Professional for Requirements EngineeringA", which defines a requirements engineer's practical skills on different training levels. The book covers the different subjects of the curriculum for the Certified Professional for Requirements EngineeringA" (CPRE) defined by the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB). It supports its readers in preparing for the test to achieve the Foundation LevelA" of the CPRE.
