"Over the last 30 years, interest has grown in using clay as an environmentally friendly building material that has proved its ideal sustainability for centuries. Light earth constructions, where a wooden framework or timber-framed walls are infilled with clay and fiber material, have extraordinarily solid, structural characteristics. Earth constructions are no longer considered exotic today, which, in part, is due to this standard work. The publication presents the use of this 'old' building material comprehensively and modernly, and contains many practical tips about simplifying designs as well as using prefabricated clay materials in the contemporary construction process. The selected project examples show the diversity of this building material, and the self-build projects demonstrate the beauty of working with lightweight earth using your own hands. The book is aimed at builders, architects and engineers, producers and artisans, as well as self-builders."

The United Nations projected in 2008 that by the end of that year, for the first time in history, half of the world's population would be living in urban areas. With a growing urban population comes new challenges for cities, compounding the existing energy security and global warming issues nations all over the world are facing. There is an unquestionably critical and urgent need for sustainable developments. The aim of this study was to examine and learn from the successes and failures of two pioneering sustainable urban development projects. Hammarby Sjöstad, located in Stockholm, and BedZED, located in the UK, were both designed around the same time in the late 1990s to spearhead sustainable development in urban areas. The emphasis of this study is placed on energy efficiency, stormwater management, waste management and transport. Relevant aspects of the planning process that impacted these areas are also analyzed. The thesis concludes by drawing important lessons and making recommendations for future developments.
