"Field research - leaving one's home institution in order to acquire data, information or insights that significantly inform one's research - remains indispensable, even in a digitally networked era. This book, the first of its kind in political science, reconsiders the design and execution of field research and explores its role in producing knowledge. First, it offers an empirical overview of fieldwork in the discipline based on a large-scale survey and extensive interviews. Good fieldwork takes diverse forms yet follows a set of common practices and principles. Second, the book demonstrates the analytic benefits of fieldwork, showing how it contributes to our understanding of politics. Finally, it provides intellectual and practical guidance, with chapters on preparing for field research, operating in the field and making analytic progress while collecting data, and on data collection techniques including archival research, interviewing, ethnography and participant observation, surveys, and field experiments"-- Provided by publisher

This Second Edition summarizes the state of the art of gender issues in fieldwork both in anthropology and sociology. Warren shows how the researcher's gender affects both the fieldwork relationships and the production of ethnography. The authors focus is more empirical than theoretical; using literature on gender and ethnography, together with their own experiences as women ethnographers, they focus on ways in which researchers represent these experiences through narrative.

Ethnography or participant observation research has been performed since the early nineteenth century and is now one of the most common ways for field researchers to gain an in-depth understanding of social life. In Observing the Observer: Understanding Our Selves in Field Research--the only book that covers the issue of reflexivity in field research--author Shulamit Reinharz provides a captivating analysis of her yearlong stay in Israel, where she engaged in a study of aging on a kibbutz. Exploring the issue of reflexivity, this unique volume focuses on the key tool in fieldwork--the self. It discusses how the many facets of the self (or selves ) of a researcher--research selves, personal selves, and situational selves--can affect how research is enacted and reported on. The book addresses many of the current debates on fieldwork, especially those that have arisen in the feminist literature.

Shanzhai products in everyday life : ethnographic fieldwork in China
Archaeology has progressed enormously since the early excavations of classical sites such as Olympia and Ephesus in the middle of the 19th century. A better perspective on the material culture of the classical world is now given by new methods and modern techniques, which depend on the rigorous application of skills from a wide range of disciplines. This book, written by a group of active field archaeologists, is designed particularly for students at A-level and on university courses, as well as for those with a general interest in the ancient world. It demonstrates the progression of a project from planing and prospection, through excavation and study to interpretation and public presentation. It also provides links to a wide range of internet resources to enable students to follow through case studies of recent survey and excavation ranging in time from the Bronze Age to the early Byzantine, and in extent from Britain to Turkey.
