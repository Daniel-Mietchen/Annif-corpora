This report represents a thesis plan performed on a bachelor level for International Business degree programme conducted in English. The report contains a thorough outlay of marketing communications plan with a focus on communicating interior design services of the case company Oksa Design Oy to Russian people who own or are planning to own property in Finland. The primary purpose of this report is to find out what kind of marketing strategy should be done to promote case company's services among its chosen target customers. The objectives of the research are to investigate profile and buying behaviour of the potential target customers as well as to provide necessary advice for marketing communications strategy development and creation of added value. The end result will be presented in form of written recommendations for future actions. The research methods used in this thesis are quantitative and qualitative with focus on deductive approach. Consequently, an online survey and in-depth interviews were conducted during a period of one month. The results have shown that the interest for purchasing interior design services by Russians owning or planning to own property in Finland from a Finnish company exist. The suggested marketing communications plan consists of a set of recommendations based on company's resources and target customer needs.
