No single book currently available in either the U.K. or the U.S. brings together such a blend of theory, research and practice in relation to the support of deaf students in higher education. The range of contributors, their national and international reputations in this field, and the innovative nature of the diverse materials gathered here will ensure this volumes place as an indispensable resource. Focusing predominantly on the U.K., this book will also be relevant to a wider international audience in a field seeking to establish global networks. The model of support developing in the U.K. and described in these chapters, represents a significant shift in practice, from that founded on the now widely discredited medical perspective, to one reflecting a social framework. In the U.S., the catalyst for this change has been the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, whilst in the U.K., this shift is mirrored in the Disability Discrimination Act, 1995, most notably within Part IV (Special Educational Needs and Disability Act :2001, enforced 2002), which requires educational institutions to monitor entry, progression and outcomes for deaf students. In the wake of this, it is expected that deaf students will enter a wider range of institutions in increasing numbers. The consequent demand for these establishments to become inclusive, proactive, consultative and anticipatory in their support for deaf students will ensure that this book is welcomed as comprehensive and essential reading. With contributions from researchers and practitioners, and including personal testimony from undergraduate and postgraduate deaf students, this volume offers illuminating and fresh perspectives on the many elements of good practice and quality provision.

Written in a workbook fashion and designed as a teaching / learning vehicle, Building ASL Interpreting and Translation Skills is for students taking courses in American Sign Language (levels I, II or III), as well as students enrolled in interpreting programs. The written English narratives are designed for translation, interpreting and transliterating with over 80 examples on the companion DVD signed by both native Deaf individuals and nationally certified interpreters. The book is divided into four parts. Part I: The first part of the text consists of 24 chapters that provide readers with an overview of a variety of ASL grammatical features. Each chapter includes an example glossed into ASL to provide students with a model for translation, each of which are signed on the accompanying DVD, followed by narratives for student practice that gradually increase in length and difficulty.

This new title in the McGraw-Hill Second Language Professional Series contributes to the emerging new discipline of Translation Studies, and more specifically, to translation pedagogy. As such it connects theory and research to teaching practice through a pedagogical framework that serves as the foundation for teacher education and preparation. While it has as a goal the explanation of relevant theoretical and empirical research, its more encompassing objective is to serve as a handbook for the training of translation teachers. The result is a systematic methodology of translation teaching that replaces the anecdotal approaches that have been dominant in this field.

Signed language interpreting continues to evolve as a field of research. Stages of professionalization, opportunities for education and the availability of research vary tremendously among different parts of the world. Overall there is continuing hunger for empirically founded, theoretically sound accounts of signed language interpreting to inform practice, pedagogy and the development of the profession. This volume provides new insights into current aspects of preparation, practice and performance of signed language interpreting, drawing together contributions from three continents. Contributors single out specific aspects of relevance to the signed language interpreting profession. These include preparation of interpreters through training, crucial for the development of the profession, with emphasis on sound educational programmes that cover the needs of service users and the wide-ranging skills expected from practitioners. Resources, such as terminology databases, are vital tools for interpreters to prepare successfully for events. Practice oriented, empirical investigations of strategies of interpreters are paramount not only to increase theoretical understanding of interpreter performance, but to provide reference points for practitioners and students. Alongside tackling linguistic and pragmatic challenges, interpreters also face the challenge of dealing with broader issues, such as handling occupational stress, an aspect which has so far received little attention in the field. At the same time, fine-grained assessment mechanisms ensure the sustainability of quality of performance. These and other issues are covered by the eighteen contributors to this volume, ensuring that the collection will be essential reading for academics, students and practitioners.

The history of translation and interpreting is above all the history of men, women, and sometimes children, who became translators and interpreters. This book presents the lives, loyalties, and identities of interpreters who, either by choice or by force, had to work during wartime.
Emphasising the significance of foreign languages at the centre of war and conflict, this book argues that 'foreignness' and foreign languages are key to our understanding of what happens in war. Through case studies the book traces the role of languages in intelligence, military deployment, soldier/civilian meetings, occupation and peace building.

Leo Yates, Jr.'s Interpreting at Church: A Paradigm for Sign Language Interpreters is a well-written and one-of-a-kind resource that discusses essential information for sign language interpreters who will provide professional services in a church or other Christian environment. The book covers a wide range of materials including certification, ethical and legal issues, standards, compensation, and skill development. It also contains a religious sign dictionary and helpful suggestions from veteran interpreters.
This book is intended for people working primarily from ASL to English. It identifies skills required to render ASL to English interpretations using the same research method as the first book. These two pieces of research complement each other and should be used together. In both books, the term ASL is used in its broadest sense meaning that Deaf/deaf signers may use a wide range of language from ASL native signing to a more English-based signing. This entire range of signing was included in the research. No restrictions were placed on the degree of ASL fluency.
The content of this book was derived from animpirical study aimed at finding out the challengesSign Language Interpreters face working with childrenwith Hearing Impairment in inclusive educationalsettings, Uganda's experience. The authorprincipally explores the challenges identified, thoseemanating from Sign language interpreters and fromthe school working environment. The influences andcopying strategies are highlighted. Supplementaryinformation on attitudes, School and communityrelationships and interpreter competencies areinclusive in the text. Theoretical foundations taggedto the theory advanced by scholars Bloom and Lahey(1997)were helpful in unearthing the underlying factors tothe phenomenon of Sign language interpreting. Thebook stresses an objective analysis of theinterpreters experiences and challenges they face.Recommendations to develop a good workingenvironment, interpreter development, Teachertraining in the area of Special needs education andSign language, school adaptation to the work of Signlanguage interpreters and such related areas ofresearch are suggested in the end, in order to helpachieve the principle of Inclusive education generally.

These findings from the Durham University research project which observed court cases involving Deaf people over three years, and carried out in-depth interviews with Deaf people and Interpreters, reveal that sign language court interpreters are often not qualified interpreters, or have had no specialist legal interpreting training. The highly skilled task is often poorly understood by other participants in court proceedings, and the difference between BSL and English imposes particular constraints and demands on the interpreter.

Hands across the sea
"The ten papers in Signed Language Interpretation and Translation Research cover a range of topics, including the need for Deaf perspectives in interpretation research, discourse strategies and techniques that are unique to video relay call settings, the benefits of using sociology as a lens for examining sign language interpreting work, translating university entrance exams from written Portuguese into Libras (Brazilian Sign Language), the linguistic choices interpreters make when interpreting ASL figurative language into English, the nature of designated interpreting, and grammatical ambiguity in trilingual VRS interpreting. The research findings and insights contained here will be invaluable to scholars, students, and practitioners."--
Are Deaf people equal before the law? Do they have equal access to the justice system? These questions are exploired in this book which draws upon the work of a major research project, 'Access to Justice for Deaf People in the Bilingual, Bimodal Courtroom'. This project was carried out by a research team at the University of Durham. For three years researchers observed a wide range of court cases in which Deaf people were involved as defendants or accused, witnesses or victims. Some court proceedings were video-taped, but the research team also carried out in-depth interviews with Deaf people and interpreters, as well as conducting a survey among interpreters.

The interpreter's resource
The thought processes of Deaf interpreters served as the research focus for this study. This longitudinal qualitative study was designed to assess the thought processes, using a three-phase research approach--a preliminary interview, Think Aloud Protocol, and a retro-debriefing interview to explore the strategies and recourses for effective interpretation. The Think Aloud Protocol was conducted with a given task in which the participants had to think aloud as they worked through the task. The preliminary interview gathered background information and experiences as interpreters and the retro-debriefing interview served a technique of collecting further thoughts after the Think Aloud Protocol activity and as a closure for the three-phase procedure. The entire study was videotaped and then translated from American Sign Language to English. A triangulation of the study explored the depths of the thought processes of six Deaf participants during the three-phase activity. Findings indicated results on best practices for strategies and resources for effective interpretation by Deaf interpreters.

Educational interpreting : how it can succeed
"This ground-breaking work, originally published 15 years ago, continues to serve as the primary reference on the theories of omission potential and translational contact in sign language interpreting. In the book, noted scholar Jemina Napier explores the linguistic coping strategies of interpreters by drawing on her own study of the interpretation of a university lecture from English into Australian Sign Language (Auslan). A new preface by the author provides perspective on the importance of the work and how it fits within the scholarship of interpretation studies. The concept of strategic omissions is explored here as a tool that is consciously used by interpreters as a coping strategy. Instead of being a mistake, omitting part of the source language can actually be part of an active decision-making process that allows the interpreter to convey the correct meaning when faced with challenges. For the first time, Napier found that omission potential existed within every interpretation and, furthermore, she proposed a new taxonomy of five different conscious and unconscious omission types. Her findings also indicate that Auslan/English interpreters use both a free and literal interpretation approach, but that those who use a free approach occasionally switch to a literal approach as a linguistic coping strategy to provide access to English terminology. Both coping strategies help negotiate the demands of interpretation, whether it be lack of subject-matter expertise, dealing with dense material, or the context of the situation. Napier also analyzes the interpreters’ reflections on their decision-making processes as well as the university students’ perceptions and preferences of their interpreters’ linguistic choices and styles. Linguistic Coping Strategies in Sign Language Interpreting is a foundational text in interpretation studies that can be applied to interpreting in different contexts and to interpreter training."

Working with or without a native speaker, a storyteller can touch the minds and hearts of all listenerseven those with little or no English language skills. Here a group of expert storytellers share a variety of tips and techniques that help bridge the language gap; along with sample stories that librarians, teachers, and professional storytellers can easily incorporate into their repertoires. Four basic techniques for bilingual telling are explored: summarizing, line-by-line translation, tandem telling, and inserted phrases. In addition, contributors discuss such topics as the translator's role, using story in language instruction, presenting tellers of other languages, traveling and giving workshops abroad, and more.

Part II The second part of the text consists of 20 chapters covering additional grammatical features. The selections become increasingly longer in length. Selections in the first several chapters of Part II are also signed by a Deaf individual on the companion DVD. As the selections become longer, a nationally certified interpreter interprets selected narratives modeling the ASL principle described in the chapter. Part III: The third part of the text is devoted to exercises that focus on building automaticity when confronting multiple meaning words, idioms, and college level vocabulary. These selections are longer in length and are designed to provide interpreters with source material that covers a wide variety of topics. Part IV: The fourth part of the text includes narratives, lectures, and passages from texts that might be read in a high school or college class.
