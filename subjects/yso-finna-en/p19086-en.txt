The early years of the twenty-first century have seen dramatic changes within the television industry. The development of the internet and mobile phone as platforms for content directly linked to television programming has offered a challenge to the television set’s status as the sole domestic access point to audio-visual dramatic content. Viewers can engage with ‘television’ without ever turning a television set on. Whilst there has already been some exploration of these changes, little attention has been paid to the audience and the extent to which these technologies are being integrated into their daily lives. Focusing on a particular period of rapid change and using case studies including Spooks, 24 and Doctor Who, Transmedia Television considers how the television industry has exploited emergent technologies and the extent to which audiences have embraced them. How has television content been transformed by shifts towards multiplatform strategies? What is the appeal of using game formats to lose oneself within a narrative world? How can television, with its ever larger screens and association with domesticity, be reconciled with the small portable, public technology of the mobile phone? What does the shift from television schedules to online downloading mean for our understanding of ‘the television audience’? Transmedia Television will consider how the relationship between television and daily life has been altered as a result of the industry’s development of emerging new media technologies, and what ‘television’ now means for its audiences.
Digital video and HDTV : algorithms and interfaces
Evaluation of IPTV system and terminals
Switching from analog to digital television is the most significant leap for the modern television industry since color TV. Digital television offers a remarkably better quality in both audio and video than its predecessors. It also makes an interactive TV experience possible for the consumers. The logical next step in expanding the DTV experience is to offer a digital replacement for the VCR. A file system is a remarkable part when creating home electronics with hard drive interfaces. It takes care of all higher-level transactions to/from the hard disk and is essential in ensuring system stability. This thesis covers the basic ideas and components in creating a set-top box with a personal video recorder (PVR) and goes through the enhancement process from the previous inadequate file system to a new more stabile version. Finally a thorough testing is performed on the file system.
