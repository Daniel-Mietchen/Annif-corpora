"About one in every thousand babies born each year has clubfoot, a disorder that affects foot and calf muscles. Because treatment usually begins soon after birth and continues for several years, parents play a key role in the treatment of clubfoot and need to be able to communicate effectively with their child's doctor. The Parents' Guide to Clubfoot is the only book about clubfoot that is written for parents so they can learn everything they need to know about their child's condition. It is an all-in-one resource with medical information, advice from parents, comments from clubfoot experts, and even an illustrated story for preschoolers that parents can read aloud to their children. Written in everyday language, the book covers clubfoot in babies and older children from diagnosis through treatment for mild to severe cases. It provides details on clubfoot, its causes, treatment and care, along with an extensive list of resources and clubfoot assessment aids. In keeping with currently preferred treatments in the U.S., it emphasizes the Ponseti method, which minimizes surgery, and includes perspectives from Ponseti-trained clubfoot doctors and parents of children with clubfoot. However, separate chapters discuss all pre-treatment and post-treatment care options and one chapter covers surgery and post-surgery care if it becomes necessary"--

The purpose of this thesis was to compile a written self-care guide for the liver cirrhosis patients. A written guidebook supports the spoken guidance given e.g. in the hospital. This thesis was also intended to be used by those who are studying medical-surgical nursing. The understanding of pathophysiology caused by liver cirrhosis is fundamental for both, patients and nurses. The objective of this thesis was to provide more information from liver cirrhosis, its etiology and symptoms, and to give advice for a patient's self-care. Well-designed written patient instructions were also analyzed. The importance for this project arouse from the fact that over 500 people are dying of the cirrhosis in Finland every year. Referring to studies liver cirrhosis is a serious, growing health problem in Finland. Cirrhosis is a state of a liver disease that cannot be cured, but the objective of the care is to stop the progress of the cirrhosis. Information provided by a health care professional can have an essential effect on keeping the condition of the liver cirrhotic patient from getting worse. This thesis was a functional process. The information was gathered from professional literature and from electronic sources; articles regarding liver cirrhosis, care and self-care. The theoretical part of this thesis is the basis of the final product which is a printed leaflet. The leaflet describes the background of the disease and gives the basic instructions for a liver cirrhosis patient's self-care. The information in the guide was demonstrated as clearly as possible, so it would be understandable and easy to follow by the patients. Plenty of information about liver cirrhosis and its etiology and symptoms was found successfully. However, a new medical research provides constantly a lot of new information about the subject. Therefore, the information of this thesis related to the subject has to be updated regularly.
