Changed ratios of soil gases that lead to hypoxia are most often present in waterlogged soils, but can also appear in soils not saturated with water. In natural CO₂ springs (mofettes), gases in soil air differ from those in typical soils. In this study, plant roots from the mofette area Stavešinci (Slovenia) were sampled in a spatial scale and investigated for AM fungal colonization. AM fungi were found in roots from areas with high geological CO₂ concentration, however mycorrhizal intensity was relatively low and no correlation between AM fungal colonization and soil pattern of CO₂/O₂ concentrations (up to 37% CO₂) was found. The relatively high abundance of arbuscules in root cortex indicated existence of functional symbiosis at much higher CO₂ concentrations than normally found in soils. In addition, concentration of two different glomalin-related soil protein fractions - EE-GRSP and TG-GRSP - was measured. No significant correlation between any of the fractions and soil gases was found, however the concentration of both fractions was significantly higher in the upper 0-5 cm, compared to the 5-10 cm layer of the soil.

No analysis of the Russian economy today can ignore the role of energy production. Russia is the world's largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, the world's third largest consumer of energy and a global giant in hydrocarbon exports. But just how big is the actual contribution of oil and gas production to national economic output? Who is discovering, pumping and shipping Russia's oil? What is the energy sector's role in government revenue and Russia's external balance? This issue of BOFIT Online comprises nine short articles with timely insights into the challenges facing Russia's energy sector.  Key words: Russia, energy, natural gas, oil, state economy, electricity production .

John Houghton's market-leading textbook is now in full colour and includes the latest IPCC findings, making it the definitive guide to climate change. Written for students across a wide range of disciplines, its simple, logical flow of ideas gives an invaluable grounding in the science and impacts of climate change and highlights the need for action on global warming. Is there evidence for climate changing due to human activities? How do we account for recent extremes of weather and climate? Can global electricity provision and transport ever be carbon free? Written by a leading figure at the forefront of action to confront humanity's most serious environmental problem, this undergraduate textbook comprehensively explores these and other issues, allowing students to think through the problem, assess the data and draw conclusions on the action that should be taken, by governments, by industry and by each and every one of us.

This book lays the foundations of gas- and fluid dynamics. The basic equations are developed from first principles, building on the (assumed) knowledge of Classical Mechanics. This leads to the discussion of the mathematical properties of flows, conservation laws, perturbation analysis, waves and shocks. Most of the discussion centers on ideal (frictionless) fluids and gases. Viscous flows are discussed when considering flows around obstacles and shocks. Many of the examples used to illustrate various processes come from astrophysics and geophysical phenomena.--

The Russian gas sector, one of Russia's key industries, needs urgent reform to deal with ageing gas fields, excessive state regulation, monopolistic control over the industry and inadequate, outdated pipeline infrastructure.The dangers of supply disruptions are particularly striking in view of ever-increasing demand for natural gas in Russia's domestic market and internationally.To prevent Russian natural gas supply from decline, three major issues must be addressed.First, regulation has kept domestic prices artificially low and eliminated incentives to make necessary investments.Second, independent producers still lack fair access to the market, especially the pipeline network.Third, there is a compelling need for systematic investment.Keywords: Russia, Natural Gas, Energy, Reform .

Traditional fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline have been dominating the transport fuel industry for decades. However in a situation where policies and agreements on reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy are made, it is likely that sustainable sources of energy will be increasing their market share, eventually completely or partly replacing fossil energy sources. The commissioner of this thesis operates a local biogas plant. The plant processes organic waste to produce biogas which can be refined into a transport fuel. The commissioner is planning on starting commercial distribution of biogas as a transport fuel in the year 2016. The aim of this thesis was to study and analyze the overall market conditions of biogas as transport fuel and provide recommendations on what marketing activities should be implemented by the commissioner. Thesis was made by conducting a secondary research using the available written sources and the access to industry knowledge acquired by of the commissioner. The marketing recommendations were made after conducting multiple strategic analyses, applying theory of B2B marketing, and taking notice of the realities and resources of a relatively small company. As a conclusion of this study, the commissioner was recommended to implement organized personal selling activities with the support of well-designed owned, earned and paid media. Relationship marketing practices should be implemented in order to maximize customer retention. The overall strategy of how and where to sell the product should be precisely decided, and some strategic insight and findings which were made during the research process are also presented in the report.

This package is aimed at ships' officers and similar shore-based personnel whose duties include the use of portable gas detectors. It explains that portable gas detectors are a vital part of safety procedures. They must be used, and used properly, when it's appropriate. It's to the individual's personal benefit and the benefit of the people they work with or control. Many people forget that some spaces on ships and in terminals - cargo or gas tanks, for instance - are, under normal circumstances, totally unable to support life for one reason or another. That, not unnaturally, makes them very dangerous environments. There are any number of ways in which a space can become hazardous. The package covers many of the most common and shows how portable gas detectors can help. Set on board various types of ship, including tankers and cargo ships and ashore in terminal, the package shows a wide range of equipment, including modern devices and older designs which are still widely used. The package covers the three main areas in which portable gas detectors are used: detecting flammable gases, toxic gases, and checking for oxygen - usually to ensure that the air is safe to breathe. Each of these is covered in a separate section. Typical situations are featured in each. The package explains why gas detectors are used in each of these three areas. It also highlights the need to make sure that each person watching and the people with whom they work are safe...
