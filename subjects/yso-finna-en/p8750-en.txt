"The improved survival of very preterm and very low birth weight infants in recent decades has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of physical and neurodevelopmental problems. Attention is increasingly being focused on the quality of life of survivors, who are at greater risk of brain damage and consequent neurological disorders, and neuropsychological and behavioural impairments. In this volume, leading experts present a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on research in various aspects of the long-term consequences of very preterm birth. As well as extending existing knowledge of the neurodevelopmental sequelae following very preterm birth, a shared aim of this burgeoning body of research is to identify the mechanisms underlying variations in outcome, and thus recognise subgroups of children who are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems, for whom appropriate intervention strategies can be devised. Pediatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists will all find this to be essential reading"--Provided by publisher.
