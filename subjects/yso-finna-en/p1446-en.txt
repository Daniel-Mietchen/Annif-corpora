Besides the general consumer rights guaranteed in EU legislation, the EU has defined since the opening of the energy supply market a set of rights that all EU citizens enjoy as energy consumers. Their aim is to help you, among other, to get a better deal, and to track and manage your energy use. Your rights as an energy consumer have to be clearly set out in the national laws of your country and must reflect provisions in EU legislation.
