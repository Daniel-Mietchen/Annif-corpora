"This study of the design, manufacture and use of medieval floor tiles shows the long-lasting influence achieved in the north of England by the monasteries of the reformed movement, particularly the Cistercians. It serves to demonstrate how these monastic houses made use of the resources and contacts available to them." "Over 500 different designs and 60 mosaic arrangements that had been in use in the medieval period were identified from the extant tiles and from searches of published literature and antiquarian records. The study examines changes in the design, production and use of a particular artefact type, in a large region, over a long period of time."--BOOK JACKET.

Latin inscriptions can appear daunting – a jumble of letters without any structure or meaning. However, once you know how, most are easy to read as they follow strict rules of grammar and abbreviation. This book will teach readers how to 'decipher' them and will highlight how even the smallest piece of information that an inscription may provide can help classicists and archaeologists to reconstruct the daily life of ordinary Romans.

"Plates and Shells for Smart Structures firstly gives an overview of classical plate and shell theories for piezoelectric elasticity, demonstrating their limitations in static and dynamic analysis with a number of example problems. The authors then go on to explain how these limitations can be overcome with the use of the more advanced models that have been developed in recent years; introducing theories able to consider electromechanical couplings as well as those that provide appropriate interface continuity conditions for both electrical and mechanical variables. They provide both analytical and finite element solutions, thus enabling the reader to compare the strong and weak solutions to problems.Plates and Shells for Smart Structures is accompanied by dedicated software MUL2 that is used to obtain the numerical solutions in the book, allowing the reader to reproduce the examples given in the book as well as to solve other problems of their own"--

A mountain might be thousands of feet high, but it can still grow taller or shorter each year. This classic picture book explores how mountains are made—including how Mount Everest grew from a flat plain under an ocean to become 29,028 feet tall! This book features simple activities and fascinating cross-sections of the earth’s moving crust that clearly explain plate tectonics. Both text and artwork were vetted for accuracy by an expert in the field.
