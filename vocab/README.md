# General Finnish Ontology YSO

The [General Finnish Ontology
YSO](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/services/expert-services-of-data-description/general-finnish-ontology-yso)
is a multilingual subject vocabulary.  It is available in three languages:
Finnish, Swedish and English.

## SKOS files

### YSO 2019.3 Cicero

The files [yso-ysoplaces-skos-cicero.ttl](yso-ysoplaces-skos-cicero.ttl) and
[yso-ysoplaces-skos-cicero.rdf](yso-ysoplaces-skos-cicero.rdf) contain a
version of YSO ([2019.3
Cicero](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Finto-data/tree/master/vocabularies/yso/releases/2019.3.Cicero))
released in March 2019 along with the place names from [YSO
Places](https://finto.fi/yso-paikat/en/) from the same date. The contents of
Turtle and RDF/XML files are the same, only the RDF serialization syntax
differs.

### YSO 2018.3 BoÃ«thius

The file [yso-skos-boethius.rdf](yso-skos-boethius.rdf) is a version of YSO
(2018.3 Boethius) released in March 2018.  The SKOS file in this repository
is simply converted to RDF/XML from the [original Turtle
file](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Finto-data/tree/master/vocabularies/yso/releases/2018.3.Boethius)
using the `rapper` tool, because Maui (as of version 1.4.5) requires RDF/XML
syntax. There are no place names in this version.

## TSV files

The TSV files in this directory are in a [simple TSV
format](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Subject-vocabulary-formats)
supported by Annif.

### YSO 2019.3 Cicero

The `yso-ysoplaces-cicero-*.tsv` files contain the concepts (URIs and
preferred labels) of YSO 2019.3 Cicero (plus the place names, see above).

### Old 2017 YSO

The `yso-*.tsv` files contain a version of YSO that dates from March 2017 and is the
same version used to build the original yso-finna document corpora under the
[training](../training/) directory.
