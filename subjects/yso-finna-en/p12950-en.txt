Childhood : critical concepts in sociology. Volume 1
"Chinese society has seen phenomenal change in the last 30 years. Two of the most profound changes have been the rise of the individual in both public and private spheres and the consequent individualization of Chinese society itself. Yet, despite China's recent dramatic entrance into global politics and economics, neither of these significant shifts has been fully analyzed. China presents an alternative model of social transformation in the age of globalization, therfore its path to development may have particular implications for the developing world.The Individualization of Chinese Society reveals how individual agency has been on the rise since the 1970s and how this has impacted on everyday life and Chinese society more broadly. The book presents a wide range of detailed case studies focusing on the impact of economic policy, patterns of kinship, changes in marriage relations and the socio-economic position of women, the development of youth culture, the politics of consumerism, and shifting power relations in everyday life. Exploring the rise of the individual in both rural and urban settings, The Individualization of Chinese Society provides a detailed overview of this major social phenomenon and its wider implications"--Provided by publisher

As much of the intense political and social changes in Madagascar revolve around urban youth, who view themselves as avatars of modernity, this book argues that traditional social science offers inadequate theorizations of generational change and its contribution to broader cultural historical processes.
