Nymph : motif, phantom, affect : a contribution to the study of Aby Warburg (1866-1929)
Cave of the Nymphs at Pharsalus is the first book-length study of one of Greece's most cited nymph sanctuaries. The volume includes a revised catalog, extensive new commentaries on the cave's famous inscriptions, and a first-time investigation of the site's topographical and archaeological layout. Also known as Alogopati or Karapla cave, the Pharsalian shrine holds a special place among ancient nymph caves as the only such site to feature an inscribed poetic chronicle of the shrine's foundation and its founder, the mysterious nymph worshipper Pantalces. Based on years of fieldwork and archival research, Cave of the Nymphs challenges some commonly held views about the origin of this rock-cut 'tale' and offers a fresh perspective for understanding the Pharsalian cave in its proper historical context.
"The presence and the meaning of the nymph in late medieval and early modern art goes beyond the fashionable adoption of an antique motif. It was Aby Warburg ... who developed a passionate interest in the divine girl ... who wandered near bucolic springs and grottoes....It is not the nymph's iconographic Nachleben that interests me here, but rather her pictorial identity in early humanism. This aspect opens up a discourse on movement and the wind in the visual medium, on pictorial 'disruptors', on the impact of the nymph on the viewer, and on (self-)reflection in the fine arts, particularly painting."--P. [3].
