The purpose of this Master's thesis was to improve a technology oriented mobile network performance monitoring towards a service oriented model, and study the fundamental mobile network characteristics affecting the mobile network performance reporting. This Master's thesis introduces relations between mobile network architecture, radio network structure and mobile network Performance Management. The Six Sigma methodology is introduced on a general level, and common statistics to monitor a process are presented. The research work for this Master's thesis was carried out inside the Author's Six Sigma Black Belt project to renew the Mobile Network Performance Quality Team Report. The Six Sigma DMAIC process was used to reach the results. The scope of the thesis was limited to speech telephone service and the primary measure for the analysis was the KPI call success.The DMAIC process Measure phase result was a new service oriented report structure which associates the technological KPI sets with the services critical to characteristics. There were two main results from the DMAIC process Analyze phase. The first Analyze phase result was the most critical input factors for the KPI call success. The mobile network's fundamental characteristics found were the populations Rural and Urban and the traffic share between them, which explains the long term variation in the statistically significant sense. The second Analyze phase result was the found root cause for the large short term variation. The formula of the used KPI call success itself was the root cause indicating lower performance for the days with a higher average call duration.The common finding of the long term and short term analysis was that the customer behaviour is a statistically significant factor for mobile network performance monitoring in the scope of traffic movements between the populations and call duration changes. The importance of customer behavioural factors increases if the KPI measures are used to compare the performance of mobile networks from different markets when such customer behaviour difference might occur.

With even little or no prior programming experience, you can learn the code necessary to build an app by following the how-to instructions in this book-and-video combo. Comprised of clear, no-nonsense lessons, the book walks you through each tutorial and then encourages you to work through simple exercises so that you can immediately apply what you just learned. These lessons are backed by video demonstrations on the accompanying DVD to further illustrate the instruction and drive home the main points. In addition, the book's appendices contain helpful information such as obtaining a device UDID, testing, and distributing an app and also lists common reasons why applications are rejected, so you can prepare to take precautionary measures to avoid these instances.

Abstract: TRAU support for NetHawk LAPD Server.
The essence of the information society has been under a considerable debate during the last decade. The argumentation concerns the critique of technological determinism and the recognition of political, economic, social and cultural factors that underlie the development. In academic discourse, there has been a noticeable change from engineering based rhetoric towards more humanistic themes and a more qualitative way of speaking about the issue. Also geographical dimensions, mainly related to the urban research and applied urban planning, have emerged. In this paper the essence of the information society is analysed from a perspective of human and cultural geography. The concept of information society is being treated as a subjective construction and it can be conceptualised as a triad. Firstly, it is a tool as such, and the reference is on material symbols representing the tech-sphere of today. This includes actual devices such as computers and mobile telephones and their integrated applications. Secondly, the information society is a set of practices. This refers to everyday routines that are rarely questioned or critically explored. The most common examples of this are e-banking and e-shopping. Finally, the information society is an experience. This theme is characterised by subjective histories, individual contexts and cultural backgrounds. All these dimensions have implications on environment and social conditions of human life. This framework is being used as a tool to evaluate empirical data based on extensive survey conducted in Finland in the year 2001. The sample size was 2750 questionnaires of which 1176 were received back.

The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the evolution of third generation mobile networks from certification laboratory point of view and to draw conclusions about affects of LTE to laboratory. Certification laboratory performs conformance testing to fulfill requirements set by certification scheme. Requirement consists of defined standards.3GPP is a standardization organization producing GSM/UMTS family standards, therefore this thesis deals with its creation and general structure as well as working group methods of standard creation processes. WCDMA technology development is handled in general and also with comparison to previous GSM technology networks in order to give a more comprehensive view to digital mobile systems. UMTS system architecture and LTE physical layer is highlighted due to the fact that it has a major impact to testing methods and processes. LTE Conformance testing specification is described in section level and conclusions of laboratory impacts are presented. Through this thesis work it became evident that due to the numerous changes in LTE network architecture, transmission schemes, physical channels and protocol stacks new type of test platforms are needed for the conformance testing purposes. Therefore certification laboratory needs to trigger multiple processes related to follow up vendor activities and to ensure staff competence in relations to new standard requirements.

It seems logical to argue that mobile computing technologies are intended for use ‚Äúon-the-go.‚Äù However, on closer inspection, the use of mobile technologies pose a number of challenges for users who are mobile, particularly moving around on foot. In engaging with such mobile technologies and their envisaged development, we argue that interaction designers must increasingly consider a multitude of perspectives that relate to walking in order to frame design problems appropriately. In this paper, we consider a number of perspectives on walking, and we discuss how these may inspire the design of mobile technologies. Drawing on insights from non-representational theory, we develop a partial vocabulary with which to engage with qualities of pedestrian mobility, and we outline how taking more mindful approaches to walking may enrich and inform the design space of handheld technologies..

In mobile communications technology, increasing demand for faster connection speeds requires more from next generation mobile networks. 3GPP is a partnership organization consisting of many corporations which have interest in the future of mobile communication technology and is responsible for specifying the next generation cellular system. This next generation system is known as LTE-Advanced, and is an evolution of the original LTE system. To achieve faster transfer of data, an increase in transmission bandwidth is considered essential. This increase of transmission bandwidth is possible with Carrier Aggregation. In LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation, multiple LTE carriers can be combined to widen transmission bandwidth. However, with certain frequency band configurations there would be harmonic relation between bands used to aggregate carriers. This harmonic issue would cause sensitivity degradation in User Equipment (UE). In this thesis the harmonic issue with band configuration of 4 and 17 was examined. The goal was to find the worst case scenario for sensitivity degradation and see if it correlated with what was specified by 3GPP. UE sensitivity was measured with different power levels and bandwidths of artificially created LTE SC-FDMA 3rd harmonic distortion. Sensitivity was also measured by sweeping a continuous wave (CW) carrier across the channel used by the receiver of the UE to see if some parts of the channel would be more sensitive to interference than others. The results of these measurements confirm that 3GPP specifications for the band configuration and harmonic issue in LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation are correct. This thesis was carried out for Nokia Corporation to support the international 3GPP standardization process.
