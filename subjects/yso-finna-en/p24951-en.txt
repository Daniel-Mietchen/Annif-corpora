Social contexts of early education, and reconceptualizing play (II)
Enhancing learning through play : a developmental perspective for early years settings
In this new book, the authors outline the philosophy behind Learning Stories and call on the latest findings from the research projects they have led with teachers on learning dispositions and learning power to argue that Learning Stories can construct learner identities in early childhood settings and schools. By making the connection between sociocultural approaches to pedagogy and assessment and narrative inquiry, this book contextualizes learning stories as a philosophical approach to education, learning and pedagogy. Chapters explore how Learning Stories: help make connections with families; support the inclusion of children and family voices; tell us stories about babies; allow children to dictate their own stories; can be used to revisit children's learning journeys; can contribute to teaching and learning wisdom. This book expands on the concept of Learning Stories, and includes examples from practice in both New Zealand and the UK. It outlines the philosophy behind this pedagogical tool for documenting how learning identities are constructed, and shows through research evidence why the early years is such a critical time in the formation of learning dispositions.

This practical book offers unique and powerful ways to use play to investigate stories, big ideas, and events. It focuses on dramatic play as a natural response to learning. It argues that dramatic play is not theatre, but a dynamic process that involves planning, playing, and practice, so that children become the story, live the life of the characters, bump up against issues, and better appreciate the complexities of real life.
Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) was a German educator who introduced the concept of kindergarten. This book is a collection of fifteen essays, originally published in German in 1861, on the value of different stages of a child's play. Froebel found an educational value in every phase of the child's play, and in every object that engages its attention. Froebel finds all that the child does significant and of educational importance. In fact, he is the great pioneer and founder of child study as well as of the pedagogic theory of intellectual values. This book, originally published in 1908, was translated and annotated by Emilie Michaelis, Head Mistress of the Croydon Kindergarten and Preparatory School, and H. Keatley Moore, Examiner in Music to the Froebel Society, and Vice-Chairman of the Croydon Kindergarten Company.

Speaking and listening through drama 7-11
"This timely and accessible text successfully introduces, theorises and practically applies emerging ideas which now increasingly underpin early years practice, that of 'playful learning' and 'playful pedagogies'. By drawing upon observation, interviews and filmed material in their study of play environments, Pat Broadhead and Andy Burt offer accessible insights into key theories as well bringing together their wealth of skills and knowledge to provide numerous ideas for practical application in classroom or early years settings. In both indoor and outdoor environments, the text explores 'open-ended role play', (or 'the whatever you want it to be place') and illustrates how themes in children's play reflect their interests, experiences, knowledge gained at home and cultural heritage. By showing how children become familiar and skilful within open-ended play environments, the authors have seen the children's co-operative skills develop over time as they become connected communities of learners. This book also demonstrates how interested parents can become when involved in playful learning. Parents' knowledge and understanding, alongside that of the educators', helps to build a bridge between home and school that makes playful learning a universally understood experience by all adults involved with the child. This insightful text will be of interest to students of early years education, early years practitioners, and researchers"-- Provided by publisher.

The school of the future : theoretical and pedagogical approaches for creative and playful learning environments
Curriculum in Early Childhood Education: Reexamined, Rediscovered, Renewed provides a critical examination of the sources, aims, and features of early childhood curricula. Providing a theoretical and philosophical foundation for examining teaching and learning, this book will provoke discussion and analysis among all readers. How has theory been used to understand, develop, and critique curriculum? Whose perspectives are dominant and whose are ignored? How is diversity addressed? What values are explicit and implicit? The book first contextualizes the historical and research base of early childhood curriculum, and then turns to discussions of various schools of theory and philosophy that have served to support curriculum development in early childhood education. An examination of current curriculum frameworks is offered, both from the US and abroad, including discussion of the Project Approach, Creative Curriculum, Te Whariki, and Reggio Emilia. Finally, the book closes with chapters that enlarge the topic to curriculum-being-enacted through play and that summarize key issues while pointing out future directions for the field. Offering a broad foundation for examining curriculum in early childhood, readers will emerge with a stronger understanding of how theories and philosophies intersect with curriculum development.
