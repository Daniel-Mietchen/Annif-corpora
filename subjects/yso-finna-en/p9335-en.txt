"The book summarizes the author's experimental studies of phase relations in the chemical systems relevant to Earth, carried out in a time period of over 20 years using piston-cylinder and multi-avil presses. The results from the high-pressure studies by many other experimental petrologists were also included. The data were used to develop an internally consistent thermodynamic model, which was then used to calculate phase diagrams. This produced the largest collection of the calculated phase diagrams published so far, encompassing for the first time the temperature and pressure ranges corresponding to the whole upper mantle."--BOOK JACKET.

"Describing the physical properties of quantum materials near critical points with long-range many-body quantum entanglement, this book introduces readers to the basic theory of quantum phases, their phase transitions and their observable properties. This second edition begins with a new section suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum field theory. It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory"--
