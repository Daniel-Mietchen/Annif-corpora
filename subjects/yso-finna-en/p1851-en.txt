Diffuse load mitigation is a prevailing global challenge due to the eutrophication of water bodies. We report here long-term nutrient removal performance of two on-site sand filters (F1 and F2) in southwestern Finland, established in the 1990s. The sand filters were enhanced with a layer of phosphorus binding material Fosfilt-s, a side product of titanium dioxide production. The monitoring periods were 4.5 and 3.5years for F1 and F2, respectively. F1 only worked for some months due to blockage of the crushed stone layer. After renovation (1999), the filter worked for a year but then the Fosfilt-s layer clogged and the filter increased suspended solids (SS) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loads by 36% and 19% on average, respectively. Total P (PTOT) load was not affected. The structure and performance of F2 were more successful due to a better water distribution system. On average, 61% ofthe inflowing suspended solids, 37% of the PTOT and 45% of the DRP were removed during the monitoring period. We conclude that these filter types have the potential to be further developed into useful tools for nutrient load reduction. Development work should be focused on the treatment of subsurface drainage waters with high concentrations of dissolved nutrients, in particular. Long term field data is needed, because laboratory tests cannot fully simulate natural circumstances.

The main aim of the European Union's waste legislation and the corresponding Finnish waste legislation is to reduce the production of waste. Further, the aims of the European Union's growth strategy are to reduce the production of greenhouse gases, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy efficiency. According to the renewed Waste Tax Act, a waste tax has to be paid on all fly ashes that are deposited in landfills in Finland. A large amount of wood- and peat-based fly ashes are formed annually in Finland, and the amount is likely to increase in the future due to the increasing use of renewable energy. Previously, these ashes have mainly been deposited in industrial landfills, but the need to utilize the fly ashes has increased recently due to changes in waste legislation.In this thesis, several issues related to the utilization of wood- and peat-based fly ash were studied, with the general objective of improving the utilization potential of such ashes.As the first stage of this research, the suitability of willow ash for use as a fertilizer was studied. Willow ash would be well suited for use as a fertilizer due to its very high nutrient content. However, cadmium, a heavy metal, was found to be enriched in the ashes of the studied willow species. Due to this, special attention should be paid when choosing willow species for energy production.In the second stage of the research, the possibility of improving the strength development of wood- and peat-based fly ashes, as well as the possibility of stabilizing fly ash containing high amounts of heavy metals via the addition of cement and/or alkali activation, was investigated. Strength development was found to be dependent on the amount of reactive calcium and the ratio between that amount of reactive calcium and the sum of the reactive silicon, aluminum, and sulfur (Ca/(Si + Al + S)). The studied methodsperformed well in terms of stabilizing barium, copper, lead, and zinc.During the next stage, the effect of different chemical digestion methods, which are regulated by the Finnish waste legislation, on the utilization potential of fly ash was studied. The digestion method had a significant impact on the results of the potassium content analysis, which could affect the possibility of using fly ash as a fertilizer.As the final stage of the research, the co-granulation of ash with sewage sludge and lime was studied. From a technical point of view, the co-granulation was successful, although the compressive strength of the granules was low. Additionally, an insufficient nitrogen content was achieved with a sludge addition of 20-40 weight%.
