Now fully revised and updated, this leading ICT series volume offers concise, superbly illustrated coverage of neuroanatomy that throughout makes clear the relevance of the anatomy to the practice of modern clinical neurology. Building on the huge success of previous editions, Neuroanatomy ICT, fifth edition is designed and written primarily with the medical student in mind, although it will again be valued by the range of other students and professionals who need a clear, current understanding of this important area. Minimum assumptions are made of existing knowledge of the subject. This edition now comes with an enhanced electronic version - hosted on the new, improved Student Consult platform - providing an even richer learning experience and rapid reference anytime, anywhere!
Summary.
The human brain : an introduction to its functional anatomy
Principles of neural science
Psychopharmacology : drugs, the brain, and behavior
The mechanistic basis of chronic inflammation remains unclear. The research sheds new light on the immune cells expressing the activation markers HLA-DR and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the cells expressing Siglec receptors as being key players in the immune system responsiveness to antigens and thus in lung tissue damage of chronic inflammation. The results help understand the mechanisms of action of common drugs used in COPD, such as formoterol, tiotropium, or corticosteroids, and point to novel drug targets. The chapters also deal with brain damaging effects, by far unrecognized, of inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a time-proven management of chronic inflammatory airway conditions; asthma being a case in point. Novel methods, likely less producing side effects, of macrolide antibiotics administration by inhalation are discussed, emphasizing not only bacteriostatic but also anti-inflammatory action.

"Diagnostic Imaging: Pediatric Neuroradiology, Second Edition is a useful tool for all health professionals involved in ordering, performing, or interpreting imaging studies of the child's brain, head, neck, spinal column, and spinal cord. The book consists of diagnoses of all common disorders of the pediatric nervous system and many that are not common. For each diagnosis, information is included concerning the clinical presentation(s) of affected patients, the best sequences to perform for imaging analysis, what each imaging sequence is expected to show (in both common and uncommon presentations), and examples of images showing the key features. In addition, information is included concerning the pathophysiology and pathology of the disorders being discussed, and some basic information concerning the causative genes (when appropriate). In addition to the diagnoses, the book contains introductory chapters in multiple sections that give background on basic embryology, anatomy, and physiology as well as typical imaging features of normal structures in areas being imaged. Put together, the contents of the book make it useful for readers of many different backgrounds and at nearly all stages of training as well as practicing health professionals. This beautiful second edition comes with Amirsys eBook Advantage, an online and searchable version of the book with linked references. In classic Amirsys style, both print and electronic content is viewable in easy-to-read bulleted lists supported by clearly described images. With a comprehensive overhaul, Diagnostic Imaging: Pediatric Neuroradiology, Second Edition promises to become another classic."--Provided by publisher.

"This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded; however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording, laboratories have collected new and different "technical artifacts." We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients' conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients' outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic function during critical periods of operations, again with a time course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful time frame"--Provided by publisher.
