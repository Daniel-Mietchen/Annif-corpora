Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of preceptors in mentoring English Language Taught Degree programme (ELTDP) international nursing students in clinical practice in medical setting. Five registered nurses (RNs) with minimum of three years' experience of preceptoring ELTDP international nursing students were interviewed. The interviews were digitally recorded and data from the interviews were transcribed verbatim then analyzed using inductive content analysis. There were four main categories that emerged from the data. The first was challenges/barriers to learning with generic categories such as communication, competency, lack of motivation, and stress and pressure. The second main category was profitable teaching style with generic categories: learning by doing, preceptor-preceptee relationship and motivation. The third and fourth main categories were external (nursing schools) and internal (wards) support respectively. Language skills, cultural differences, staff nurses' negative attitude towards students pose barriers to successful learning outcomes. Participants expressed that planning beforehand, creating a friendly environment for learning; assigning duties to students and open-mindedness are profitable teaching strategies. The need for preparatory courses for preceptors and more awareness of ELTDP international nursing students in the ward if a more successful learning outcome is to be achieved is recommended.

Alcohol use is one of the problems within elderly that had not been studied enough. The purpose of this thesis was to describe how widespread alcohol problem is among elderly who are under the home care services. The idea of this research arose from the experience I had when I was doing my elderly nursing care practice and I observed how alcohol affected their health. This research was quantitative. The data was gathered by interviewing the clients with the pre-made questionnaire forms. Most of the clients were excited about the interviews and some were even happy to be visited. The result of the data gathered was analyzed in the end, by using the descriptive method. Results were displayed through frequencies, averages and percentages. One aim of this thesis was to also collect and present this information to the home care unit, in order for them to do some proper actions through the nursing care plan. There were 20 interviewees who participated in the research. Only few among the elderly interviewed had visible alcohol problem. As outcome it was pleasing to find out that the alcohol problem among elderly is not that common than what I had expected. Based on this research there are clear conclusion to be made. The alcohol problem among elderlies in the home care is not a common problem, but the healthcare workers should still consider these clients more so that they could get necessary help and information regarding the dangers of alcohol.

Abstract: This final project is part of Improving the Quality of Hand Hygiene and Asepsis in the Care of Nephrological Patients, a project conducted by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, in collaboration with the Clinics of Nephrology and Infection Diseases of HUCH, the Department of Nursing Science of Turku University Faculty of Medicine, and the Finnish Kidney and Liver  Association.    The purpose of this final project is to identify interventions that can improve hand hygiene adherence in  haemodialysis patient care and, in addition, influence the implementation of change in clinical practice.    There were 15 research articles for this literature review, collected systematically from OVID, CINAHL and PUBMEB. In addition, manual search was conducted in order to find literature supporting the concepts of hand hygiene and asepsis.    The findings showed that single interventions improved hand hygiene adherence but, in order to reach a sustained high level of adherence, multifaceted interventional programmes focusing on education and behavioural change were preferred. They should include educational courses, trainings, poster campaigns, performance feedbacks, use of technology, accessibility to hand rub, and role modelling.    The implementation of change is a long process that depends on the quality and content of the interventions, the nurses' active participation and the support institutions can provide. Further development of multifaceted interventional programmes is needed to ensure that nurses have sufficient knowledge and awareness on hand hygiene and asepsis in the care of nephrological patients.

Pain management for postoperative nephrectomy in elderly patients: a literature review
Abstract: In Finland, statistics show that the number of students from diverse cultures is increasing every year. Nursing students who study under the English Language Degree Taught Program (ELTDP) spend nearly half of their study program in clinical placements for their internship according to the European Union and nursing schools' directives. These  students need guidance and support from preceptors throughout their clinical placements. Our descriptive qualitative study was designed to explore the preceptors' experiences in precepting ELTDP nursing students in surgical clinical placements. We conducted semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions with four registered nurses from surgical wards within the Metropolitan region. Inductive content analysis was adapted in data analysis. Preceptors were aware of their role of precepting; teaching, motivating and supporting. Integrating ELTDP nursing students to the Finnish working culture and translation emerged as new roles for the preceptors. These were perceived to be confusing and time consuming due to the use of two languages simultaneously. In spite of that, preceptors were happy about meeting new people and the cultural enrichment that ELTDP nursing students brought with them. In addition, preceptors appreciated more support from nursing school teachers through consistent communication. They were of the opinion that they could get financial rewards for precepting and healthcare organizations (employers) could encourage all nurses to precept and allocate them time to attend the organized education sessions during their normal working time. In the future, the experiences of ELTDP nursing students' preceptors in Finnish healthcare organizations could be researched further.

Interprofessional course "Public health and interprofessional collaboration" was planned for the first semester medical and health care students by two universities of Oulu, Finland. The course architecture was built on blended methods including lectures, video based workshops, interactive e-learning phase based on family cases with everyday health and wellbeing problems of the family members. The course ended with student conference. All together 1681 students from ten different degree programs participated in the course during the years 2007-2013. In this paper we describe the students' readiness and attitudes towards interprofessional learning (IPL) with RIPLS (Readiness towards interprofessional learning scale) in the beginning of the course and students' feedback and learning experiences at the end of the course using the web based inquiry. The attitudes and readiness towards IPL were evaluated quite positive. The highest RIPLS scores were evaluated in Teamwork and collaboration. The different development of the attitudes between the groups was seen in Roles and responsibilities. In the longitudinal perspective the medical students evaluated all of the subscales lower than the health care students. The scoring stayed in the same level during the years. The difference between the groups was significant. The learning outcomes correlated linearly with students' own activity. Those students, who took actively part in web and group discussions learned most. Family cases helped them to get the big picture of the service system. Based on students feedback participative methods gradually replaced the traditionally methods like lectures during the years. The learning outcomes were evaluated relatively good.

Abstract: The purpose of this final project was to explore the nurses' perceptions of cultural competence in nursing.  This final project is based on 15 scientific research articles. The data was collected using Cinahl, Sage Journals, Pubmed, Wiley Interscience and manual search through the library journal collections. Literature review was used as a methodology. A critical appraisal was conducted to ensure the literature suitability to this final project. Deductive content analysis approach was adopted to analyze the data. The Papadopoulos Tilki and Taylor model for developing cultural competence was used as the conceptual framework. This model entails "Cultural Awareness, Cultural Knowledge, Cultural Sensitivity and Cultural Competence".  The findings of this literature review showed that cultural competence encompasses:  (a) Nurses abilities to do self-cultural assessment and point out those aspects of it that are at variance with the patient's values, beliefs and practices. (b) Having an ability and interest in understanding other cultures and the application of cultural knowledge when encountering people from other cultures at their best interests. (c) The ability to use a holistic approach when caring for culturally different patients. And the willingness to provide care that is based on respect, empathy, understanding and that takes into consideration the patients' cultural and religious needs. (d) And having the willingness and the ability to put into use the previously gained cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural sensitivity and nursing skills.  Despite the fact that some nurses did not know and/or have never heard of the term cultural competence, in all reviewed research articles nurses were able to identify different components that make up a culturally competent care. Further research is needed on how nurses address and challenge discriminatory practices and racism as this was given less or non-importance by the nurses, and considering the fact that it was important in the framework of this final project.
