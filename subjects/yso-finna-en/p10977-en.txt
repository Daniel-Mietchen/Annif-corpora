"Victor Stoichita traces the reverbations of Ovid's founding myth of Pygmalion from ancient times through the advent of cinema. Emphasizing its erotic origins, he locates echoes of this famous fable in everything from legendary incarnations of Helen of Troy to surrealist painting to photographs of both sculpture and people artfully posed to simulate statues. But it was only with the invention of moving pictures, Stoichita argues, that the modern age found a fitting embodiment of the Pygmalion story's influence. Concluding with an analysis of Alfred Hitchcock films that focuses on Kim Novak's double persona in Vertigo, The Pygmalion Effect illuminates the fluctuating connections that link aesthetics, magic, and technical skill. In the process, it sheds new light on a mysterious world of living artifacts that, until now, has occupied a dark and little-understood realm in the history of Western image making."--BOOK JACKET.

"Throughout history, from at least as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh, mankind has shown a fascination with physical transformation. Tales of such transformations appear in every culture across the course of history. This book approaches werewolves as representations of a proposed shape-shifter archetype, examining how and why the archetype has been employed in modern literature"--Provided by publisher
