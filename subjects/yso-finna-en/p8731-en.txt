This book describes the clinical challenge currently posed by stable angina pectoris and provides guidance for those making clinical decisions regarding its pharmacological treatment. The importance of providing effective treatment is beyond dispute and this book deals with the most relevant aspects related to its pharmacological treatment. The pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia as the basis for rational treatment of angina is discussed thoroughly together with all major management goals including optimal symptom control and the secondary prevention of serious cardiovascular events. Pharmacological Treatment of Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris provides a clear description of the mechanisms of action and clinical indications of available anti-angina drugs and strategies for the use of novel pharmacological agents. It also includes a critical appraisal of the major management guidelines, which will assist the reader to interpret current evidence and provide the most appropriate forms of treatment. The ongoing controversy regarding medical therapy versus myocardial revascularization for the management of stable angina pectoris is also addressed. This eminently practical book will help guiding the reader through the complexities of the field and will be highly appreciated by clinicians, clinical cardiologists and cardiology trainees alike.
