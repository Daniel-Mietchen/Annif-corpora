The purpose of this thesis was to monitor the winter test of John Deere tractors. The number of tractors in the test was three, two of which were operating at the same time. The purpose of the winter test was to monitor the operation of tractors in cold and snowy conditions, as well as tasks that can not be executed in Central Europe. The test examined the entire operation of the tractor, but the main focus was on the new engine technology. The goal was to conduct the test without great difficulties and produce as much feedback as possible, as well as suggestions for improvement to the factory. The idea was also to provide technical support to the customer or the service in order to keep the tractors at work for as many hours as possible. The test operators were guided to give as much feedback as possible such as improvement suggestions or defects in tractors. The theoretical part deals with the reduction of emissions in diesel engines. The thesis also presents a technology that was selected for the John Deere engines to meet the new emission standards. The test result was a variety of failures and problems, as well as reports and solutions. John Deere require typical engine load profiles in applications that can be executed in Finland, which for example due to the circumstances, cannot be executed in Central Europe. Applications were monitored for engine activity such as potential heating problems, passive regeneration efficiency and exhaust gas temperature management system. This study evaluated the risks which the tasks may cause to the machine. The most important point to monitor was the engine operation in cold starts. The load profiles and engine activity tracking was contucted by measuring the ECU values. The measurement was performed by a laptop, which was connected to the tractor bus. The computer had a program for measuring the ECU, called DevX.
This book identifies future scientific research priorities for developing emissions inventories, emissions abatement techniques and mitigation strategies in order to improve and sustain livestock production that is in line with climate change adaptation. Livestock production is a major source of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and ammonia, all of which directly contribute to global warming and climate change. Air pollutant emissions from agricultural practices have a negative environmental impact and are of relevant political importance, as highlighted in both the Kyoto and Gothenburg Protocols. This book provides solutions on how to abate these emissions by using effective abatement techniques such as additives, manure storage covers, aerobic and anaerobic treatments, and dietary manipulation. Each chapter in the book provides valuable, up-to-date information on abatement techniques, thus allowing the reader to better understand the issues involved. Recent advances and new perspectives in the field are also discussed.

The objective of the thesis was to explore comprehensively how downsizing is implemented in the case companies and to examine the reflections on the downsizing process of the managers that have been involved in downsizing activities in their companies. The purpose was to find out what measures, if included in the downsizing implementation process could lead to a successful downsizing process and consequently come up with recommendations that could be used as a guideline in the planning and implementation of downsizing. The theoretical framework was based on literature about downsizing and organisational re-structuring, mostly the theories introduced by Kim Cameron and Sarah Freeman, Joel Brockner, Aneil Mishra and Karen Mishra, Steven Appelbaum and Magda Donia, and Gretchen Spreitzer. In addition, the views of various other authors were studied to create a solid base for conducting the empirical research. The focus was on the downsizing process and its implications as these are the core issues in the research questions. The empirical part of the study was conducted in the form of semi-structured thematic interviews with three managers from three different companies. The questions guiding the inter-views were based on the theoretical framework. The analytical approach used to analyse the findings was qualitative. The empirical findings were analysed together with the frame of reference. The results of the study revealed that the companies̕ approach to downsizing was determined by the company̕ s objectives, and how the downsizing is implemented is mainly the role of the downsizing managers. In their role, managers could take into use certain tactics known as the ̕ managerial downsizing tactics̕ during the downsizing process to ensure a successful downsizing implementation process. The results also revealed that how downsizing is implemented is governed strictly by the law in Finland. Finally it was revealed that the downsizing process is a difficult undertaking for the managers, and they have taken it as part of their managerial obligations. In conclusion, certain measures if taken into use when managers are implementing downsizing in their companies could prevent adverse implications that are normally associated with downsizing and guarantee a successful downsizing process. Though the adverse consequences that accompany downsizing may never be completely eliminated, the managers could take more time to plan for the downsizing implementation process as the successful downsizing is dependent on it.

The aim of this thesis was to analyze the environmental potential of hybrid busses by comparing the fuel consumption and the tailpipe emissions of several diesel hybrid and diesel bus models. At the beginning the different bus models were chosen and in the following their performance on a drive cycle was calculated. Sources for information were books, the internet and some manufacturer data. The results showed that a reduction of about 31 to 35% in fuel consumption and emission is possible. Nevertheless the theoretical values have to be handled with caution. Actual measurement values with an actual bus performing the drive cycle on a chassis dynamometer are also needed to verify the theoretical data.

The purpose of this work was to help seeing the market situation of current marine SCR markets and gather valuable information from present marine SCR end-customers. Also the basics of both SCR technology and the marine legislation regarding harmful NOx emissions were studied in general level to better understand the current situation of rapidly changing and growing markets and industry. The information regarding the market situation was gathered from public company internet sites. The customers' demands were examined by sending questionnaires via e-mail to several marine end-customers. The Analysis of the results was based on a scoring system enclosed in the appendices. Based on this study the current SCR markets are having only few major operators which have managed to deliver remarkable amount of marine SCR systems. The others are probably in promoting or developing phase and still aiming to achieve better status within the business sector. Based on the questionnaires to the end-customers the reliability of the system was the most important feature. Second important was the purchasing and maintenance costs following small size of system and easy operation.

By explaining the lean system for identifying and eliminating waste and introducing efficiency in every aspect of the farm operation, The Lean Farm makes the case that small-scale farming can be an attractive career option for young people who are interested in growing food for their community. Working smarter, not harder, also prevents the kind of burnout that start-up farmers often encounter in the face of long, hard, backbreaking labor. Lean principles grew out of the Japanese automotive industry, but they are now being followed on progressive farms around the world. Using examples from his own familyś one-acre community-supported farm in Indiana, Hartman clearly instructs other small farmers in how to incorporate lean practices in each step of their production chain, from starting a farm and harvesting crops to training employees and selling goods. While the intended audience for this book is small-scale farmers who are part of the growing local food movement, Hartmanś prescriptions for high-value, low-cost production apply to farms and businesses of almost any size or scale that hope to harness the power of lean in their production processes. - Amazon.com.
