In Proverbs and the African Tree of Life Dorothy BEA Akoto-Abutiate juxtaposes chosen sayings from Proverbs and selected Ewe Folk proverbs using the agricultural metaphor of “grafting,” which she calls a “hermeneutic of grafting.” Though these two sets of sayings come from completely different cultural contexts, Akoto argues that folk sayings/proverbs, which abound in Africa, should be considered as an already mature, established tree on to which a piece of the biblical tree is spliced or engrafted to produce hybridized fruits that have uniquely different tastes than the fruits of each tree individually. This metaphorical grafting process allows the message of the Bible (in Proverbs) to be understood, imbibed and appropriated in Africa.
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes : introduction, translation, and notes
This annotated international bibliography on proverbs and the social sciences contains 1169 publications in many languages from around the world.

There are many entries for anthropology, ethnography,folklore, linguistics (neuro-, psycho-, and sociolinguistics), pedagogy (education and teaching), political science, psychiatry, psychology, and sociology. But the same is true for art (iconography), communication (mass media), history, law, literature, medicine (health), philosophy, and religion as they relate to aspects of the social sciences. Most of the books, dissertations, and articles listed in this bibliography are characterized by an interdisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of proverbs. In addition to the key-word annotations for each entry, there are also comprehensive name, subject, and proverb indices. The bibliographical entries in this volume on Proverbs and the Social Sciences bear witness to the truly impressive scholarship of paremiology and phraseology (excluding collections).
The functions of proverbs in social interaction
From old folk poetry to discussion in Internet
"The thirteen chapters of this book comprise an intriguing and informative entry into the world of proverb scholarship, illustrating that proverbs have always been and continue to be wisdom's international currency. The first section of the book focuses on the field of paremiology (proverb studies) in general, the spread of Anglo-American proverbs in Europe, and the phenomenon of modern proverbs. The second section analyzes the use of proverbs in the world of politics, including a chapter on President Obama, while the third concentrates on the uses of proverbs in literature. The final section ends with detailed cultural studies of the origin, history, dissemination, use, function, and meaning of specific proverbs.Noted scholar Wolfgang Mieder shows that proverbs matter in culture, literature, and politics. Proverbs remain part and parcel of oral and written communication, and, he demonstrates, they deserve to be studied from a range of viewpoints. While various chapters deal with a variety of issues and approaches, they cohere through a rhetorical perspective that looks at the text, texture, and context of proverbs as speech acts that make a noteworthy impact on culture and society. Whether proverbs appear in everyday speech, on the radio, on television, in films, on the pages of newspapers or magazines, in advertisements, in literary works, or in political speeches, they serve as formulaic verbal devices to add authoritative weight through tradition, convention, and wisdom"--

Context and meaning in Proverbs 25-27
There is no doubt that phraseology in general and paremiology in particular are experiencing a global boom that is especially pronounced in Europe, to wit the foundation of the European Society of Phraseology in 1999 with its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In North America, meanwhile, a certain revival of interest in phraseology and paremiology has also taken place. In order to make international scholars aware of the exciting paremiological work that has gone on in Canada and the United States during the past ten years, this new essay volume on (Anfang kursiv) Cognition, Comprehension, and Communication. A Decade of North American Proverb Studies (1990-2000) (Ende kursiv) is offered with the sincere hope that it will bring about further discussion and an increased interest in the intriguing world of proverbs.
