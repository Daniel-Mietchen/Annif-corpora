Today, competitive advantage cannot be gained through improving the products or lowering the prices. Advantage over the competitors must be searched from new sources, for example by focusing on customer experience. In addition the value created in the past, can be important when the customer is making the purchasing decision in the future. The changes in the consumer's wants and needs are driving companies to make changes in their business strategy. Concept of customer experience refers to finding out the needs of the customer; in order to gain competitive advantage. In addition, focusing on negative impressions is important, as people tend to share their experiences to their friends and family  this makes customer experience a marketing tool. Focusing on different aspects of customer experience is important, as customers should be the core of the business  without the customers there is no need for the company. Companies should focus on developing customer experience in order to make the customer do transactions in the future as well. The topic for this bachelor's thesis was given by the case company; Limingan Osuuspankki. During my internship, the case company wanted to conduct a research focusing on customer experience as the case company wanted to focus on develop in creating experiences for the customers. As the case company had no previous experience on the topic, the goal of this research was to find out what kind of customer experience does the customers of the case company have and to find suggestions for developing it. This study focused on different aspects of customer experience, for example - how it is created and how it can be measured. All in all, developing customer experience is dependent on many different factors. Different tools for measuring customer experience, give only one viewpoint into phenomena. ^

Dynamics of international banking
"Economics of Banking presents a thorough overview and analysis of the key aspects of financial intermediation necessary to understand this field. Based on the latest theory, and supporting arguments with practical examples, Hans Keiding discusses the problems of competition, risk taking in banks and the irregularities that may occur as a result. Banks in distress and avoiding bank failures through suitable regulation are also treated in a rigorous, yet easy-to-understand way. Economics of Banking: [bullet] treats financial intermediation both from the point of view of the bank itself and from that of society [bullet] covers both microeconomics of banking and risk management in banks [bullet] offers more complicated mathematics as optional A comprehensive advanced undergraduate or master's level textbook for students in banking, economics and finance who need to get to grips with the economic theory of banks"--

These conditions put pressure for the business managers as they should set goals for improving customer experience. Measuring without any goal is just a waste of resources. Theoretical background was gathered during the autumn 2015, as customer experience is widely researched topic, the problem was to choose the most beneficial data. The empirical part of this study was conducted by using different qualitative methods, such as theme interviews conducted for the customers and for the employees of the case company. In addition, NPS survey conducted by a third party was included in the research process. The collected data was analyzed and compared with the findings from the theory. Different research methods gave an opportunity for finding relevant data and also a chance to see the reasons behind different factors and results. Due to confidential data, results from the NPS questionnaire are marked as confidential.

The Internet of Things is all about machines trading with machines - your fridge orders groceries; your car, fuel; your television, entertainment; and so on. However, machines cannot trade with machines if it's expensive and slow. Would you really want your TV to order the next season of Games of Thrones, if the payment took ten days and cost 25 or more? Unfortunately with the way the bank system works today, that is the problem we face today. As a result, we need an Internet of Value to work with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Value - or ValueWeb, for short - allows machines to trade.

Memoirs
As incredible as it may seem in this hyper-connected, technologically advanced era, half the planet’s population exist as "Financial nomads"—those who nourish and shelter themselves without using traditional banking services. While the wealthy live at the top of a metaphorical pyramid, taking financial security and banking services for granted, there are billions of people who struggle at the pyramid's base in an exhausting state of financial exclusion and insecurity. Times are changing rapidly, but despite global uncertainty, technology has the capacity to reach and equip people in all walks of life. Advances in communications have reconfigured the ease with which we interact with our money—and these advances can provide innovative financial services to the unbanked and underserved around the world. Financial inclusion for all is indeed within our reach, and with this conviction, authors Karl Mehta and Carol Realini propose a vision for a better world and a blueprint to get there.

"Over the past three years, the notorious @GSElevator Twitter feed has offered a hilarious, shamelessly voyeuristic look into the real world of international finance. Hundreds of thousands followed the account, Goldman Sachs launched an internal investigation, and when the true identity of the man behind it all was revealed, it created a national media sensation--but that's only part of the story.  Where @GSElevator captured the essence of the banking elite with curated jokes and submissions overheard by readers, Straight to hell adds John LeFevre's own story--an unapologetic and darkly funny account of a career as a globe-conquering investment banker spanning New York, London, and Hong Kong."--Amazon.com.

China is entering a new stage of economic and societal development, called China 2.0, a new era that is characterized by China?s diminishing low-cost advantage and increased local competition. Succeeding in the China 2.0 era will require western managers to reposition their businesses. Inspired by their extensive experience in doing business in China, the authors present more than 40 key issues in a compact format suitable for time-constrained executives. The book covers the overall effects on the economy, highlights future challenges, gives first-hand advice on how to manage a business in China, and helps the reader to understand the Chinese culture. China Business 2.0 also contains valuable insight sections in which top executives and consultants share their on-the-ground-experiences in China. In addition, it features numerous practical tips that will help managers to be effective in China.
"This history of the Bank of England takes its story from the 1950s to the end of the 1970s. This period probably saw the peak of the Bank's influence and prestige, as it dominated the financial landscape. One of the Bank's central functions was to manage the exchange rate. It was also responsible for administering all the controls that made up monetary policy. In the first part of the period, the Bank did all this with a remarkable degree of freedom. But economic policy was a failure, and sluggish output, banking instability, and rampant inflation characterized the 1970s. The pegged exchange rate was discontinued, and the Bank's freedom of movement was severely constrained, as new approaches to policy were devised and implemented. The Bank lost much of its freedom of movement but also took on more formal supervision".
