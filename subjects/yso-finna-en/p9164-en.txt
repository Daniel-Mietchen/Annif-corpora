Motivation, a controversial issue in health care settings, is studied from several angles and perspectives in an attempt to find out the right levers to enhance it. However, as motivation is an internal state, direct observation or measurement is difficult. Therefore, research heads towards studying the factors that influence motivation. This paper joins numerous other studies by analyzing nurses' intrinsic motivation from the perspective of perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness.     This study uses Self-Determination Theory, which implies that workers are motivated intrinsically if they have a sense of control over their work environment, and opportunities to voice their opinions, if they feel competent in their work and challenged by it, and if they feel integrated and part of the team. Four nurses with different work experience backgrounds were interviewed about their understanding of autonomy and competence, and the factors contributing to the enhancement of these. The respondents were also asked to indicate what they perceive as supporting the development of autonomy and competence. In addition, the respondents were asked to comment on the relationship with their coworkers. The data gathered through the four theme interviews was analyzed using the qualitative content method.    The findings of this research reveal that nurses were in general satisfied with their level of autonomy. They felt competent as concerns their professional requirements and were positively challenged by their work. They stressed the importance of knowledge, experience, work environment and supervisory style in developing autonomy and competence. The respondents acknowledged the role of their colleagues in their work life and the impact that the relationship with coworkers has on their well-being.       The insights into the participants' views of autonomy, competence and relatedness prove the importance of these needs for the intrinsic work motivation of nurses. Hence, the management should focus on these issues in order to have motivated workforce.     Keywords: nurses' intrinsic motivation, autonomy, competence, relatedness, self-determination theory.

Nietzsche is a central figure in our modern understanding of the individual as freely determining his or her own values. These essays by leading Nietzsche scholars investigate what this freedom really means: How free are we really? What does it take to be free? It might be a 'right', but it also needs to be earned

"Among the most influential models in contemporary behavioral science, self-determination theory (SDT) offers a broad framework for understanding the factors that promote human motivation and psychological flourishing. In this authoritative work, SDT cofounders Richard M. Ryan andEdward L. Deci systematically review the theory's conceptual underpinnings, empirical evidence base, and practical applications across the lifespan. Ryan and Deci demonstrate that supporting people's basic needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy is critically important for virtually all aspects of individual and societal functioning."
