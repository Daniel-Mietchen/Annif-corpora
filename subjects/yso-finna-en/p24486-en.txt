The purpose of this study is to describe the process of developing innovation pedagogy and defining innovation competencies developed at Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS). The aim is also to present the concept of Innovation pedagogy, which is a new learning approach developed at TUAS. The concept of innovation pedagogy was first introduced in autumn 2008. Innovation pedagogy is a learning approach, which aims to meet the needs of working life better than before. The desired outcome of this approach is that students have certain competencies when they step into the working life. Innovation competencies developed at TUAS are individual, communal and network scale innovation competencies. The development process of innovation pedagogy started by forming a working group whose priority was to take this approach forward and to define innovation competencies, which could form the basis for TUAS pedagogical strategy. This working group consisted of members from different faculties and degree programs of TUAS. The process of developing innovation pedagogy included number of different seminars, events and working groups meetings and all of these are described in this study. One special aim was to test and present the concept of innovation pedagogy by releasing papers concerning the subject and participating in international conferences with those papers. In this study we take a closer look at two of the conference papers, one from International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation in Madrid, Spain and other one from Innovations for Competence Management held in Lahti, Finland. This study also discusses the subject of innovation pedagogy and innovation competencies from the student's point of view. It states that, even though innovation pedagogy working group has had its last meeting the development process continues and now the challenge is to get students involved. This study examines ways how innovation pedagogy is implemented in everyday education at TUAS and how it could be developed in the future.

"There is now widespread agreement that innovation holds the key to future economic and social prosperity in developed countries. But what kind of innovation is required and what is the best way to manage, steer and organize it? Grounded in the experiences of innovative firms and based on the most recent design theories, this book argues that instead of relying on traditional R&D and project management techniques, the strategic management of innovation must be based on innovative design activities. The authors analyse and explain a range of new management principles and techniques that firms can use to ensure continuous innovation. This book targets advanced courses in innovation management in industrial design schools, business schools, engineering schools, as well as managers looking to improve their practice"--
