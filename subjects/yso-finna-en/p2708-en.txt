The thesis was commissioned by Wärtsilä Finland Ltd. Engines R&D section. The purpose was to study the cost estimate of new possible starting air system of a Wärtsilä 46DF engine that is being developed and to compare the existing and possible new starting air system. New starting air system is compatible with Wärtsilä 46F engine. Technical data of the Wärtsilä 46F engines existing starting air system and possible new one is presented. Air consumption and total costs of both systems were compared. The external system is a relevant part of expenses so its effect has been noticed in the thesis. The classification societies' regulations on how systems must be made and what capacities is required were presented. In the thesis the starting air costs per one engine start was calculated and the prices of an external system and a summary of the results were presented. The history of Wärtsilä 46 engine is presented shortly and what kind of engine Wärtsilä 46F is nowadays and where it is in use. Some questions and ideas that rose during making the thesis are suggested. Conclusion was that air consumption decreases with new starting air system 31%, air receiver can be made 12.5% smaller and the cost of starting air decreased 33%

Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

21st annual marine propulsion conference : design, operate, maintain keeping ahead of today's marine propulsion issues
The purpose of this thesis was to study, how much energy is used in pumping fluids in each auxiliary system of marine main engine and to choose the system that is the most energy consuming. After choosing one system for closer observation the target was to study how pumping energy efficiency of that specific auxiliary system can be improved by changing the design, but still keeping the original technical limits for the system valid. 9L46 marine main engine was chosen as a reference engine for all calculations and all the component data for each part and unit of different manufacturer was obtained from the TERPS database in Wärtsilä Ship power's intranet page. Based on the calculated results a ballpark economical estimate of investment difference between a normal system and an energy efficient system was made.

This thesis was done for Wärtsilä Finland Ltd. The purpose of this thesis is to describe Wärtsilä 50 dual fuel engine?s automation systems in the gas commissioning phase of the power plant. This thesis is used as a work instruction for commissioning engineers. W50 dual fuel engine is an engine that can be operated with multiple fuel types. These are light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil and natural gas. In this work is concentrated on running the engine with natural gas. The quality of the natural gas has a great impact on performance and on the output of the engine. Engine automation system is used to achieve safe operation of the engine and to make the engine more easily predictable for maintenance. Implementing changes to engine running values is used to achieve efficiently operating power plant. Completed thesis includes a comprehensive content of commissioning the engine automation system.
