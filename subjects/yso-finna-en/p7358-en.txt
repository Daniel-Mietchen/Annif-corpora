anorexia nervosa
13 ways of looking at a fat girl
Through the voices of twenty-one women, Karen Way presents the most objective, complete, and compassionate picture of what anorexia nervosa is about and, more importantly, of the complex individual variables and obstacles in the journey to recovery. From the premise that anorexia nervosa is an addiction - an obsession controlling all aspects of an individual's life - and that complete recovery is possible by finding meaning in life, this enlightening book contrasts sharply to other books written on the subject by clinicians and theorists which merely speculate on the nature and etiology of anorexia nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa and Recovery lets the reader hear the personal struggles of women who have fought this powerful disease. They describe how anorexia controlled their lives and how, once they overcame their obsessions with food, weight, and thinness, they were able to lead fulfilling lives.

The contents of this thesis focuses on eating disorders among adolescents. The topic was chosen, because eating disorders are a growing global health problem with high mortality, and adolescents are the biggest risk group for developing them. Providing a reliable source of information may help prevent adolescent eating disorders by educating the public. The task of this project was to create web pages on eating disorders with a main focus on creating a guide which will provide a source of reliable information about eating disorders. This project focuses on the three main groups of eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). There was an extensive literature review done in order to accomplish the webpages and make the information provided on the webpages reliable. The information provided in this thesis will be published in Terveysnetti, a health informative website containing public information about health and illness issues. To be able to recognize eating disorders among adolescents, the three main groups of eating disorders have been identified in this project, with their symptoms and ways of recognition, possible risk factors and treatment. The risk factors have been divided into three groups: biological, psychological and social risk factors. The treatment methods were discussed only briefly, since this project aims to educate the public about eating disorders, not to provide instructions for their management.

In an extensively revised new edition of the successful Anorexia and Bulimia, Richard Gordon includes new information and discussion of the latest ideas in this rapidly growing research field. There is extensive discussion of the clinical aspects of disorders, in particular their relationship to obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, plus data of recovery and mortality. It also provides accounts of the latest research on the epidemiological status of eating disorders and the subsequent debate that this work has engendered. Further new features include the analysis of the role of sexual abuse in eating disorders; the relationship of obesity to anorexia and bulimia, and consideration of the recent debates surrounding the politics of eating disorders. The past two decades have witnessed an enormous increase in the number of cases of eating disorders in industrial societies. Richard Gordon brings together historical and cultural perspectives, as well as his own clinical experience, in order to examine the sociocultural roots of this apparent epidemic. The high incidence of these once rare conditions in contemporary societies can be traced to a number of interrelated factors: the changing role of women, the increasingly difficult transition from adolescence to adulthood, the social importance attached to physical beauty which focuses on thin body shape, a general pursuit of health and fitness and, ironically, the glamorization of anorexia in the mass media which has made its symptoms fashionable.

The authors divide the book into three easy to read sections. Part One provides the reader with an overview of the 'anorexic' and 'bulimic' personality. The reader is informed of the sociological complexity of eating for the person with anorexia or bulimia and the immense turmoil a sufferer experiences in maintaining food/body control. For the sufferer this control defines who they are; that is their sense of self worth
