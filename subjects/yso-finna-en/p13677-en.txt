"While America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening, it is not surprising that psychotherapists are increasingly expected to incorporate the spiritual as well as the psychological dimension in their professional work. Therapists also are increasingly required to utilize evidence based practices and demonstrate the effectiveness of their practice. Unlike books that focus primarily on the therapist's spiritual awareness, the second edition of Spirituality in Clinical Practice addresses the actual practice of spiritually oriented psychotherapy from the beginning to end. Spirituality in Clinical Practice has been significantly updated and revised to emphasize the therapeutic processes in spiritually oriented psychotherapy with individual chapters on the therapeutic relationship, assessment and case conceptualization, intervention, termination and evaluation, as well culturally and spiritually sensitive interventions. As in the original edition, the second edition continues to provides a concise, theory-based framework for understanding the spiritual dimension. This framework then serves as the basis for competently integrating spirituality in effective, evidence-based psychotherapy practice. Spirituality in Clinical Practice is light years beyond books that emphasizes developing therapist awareness of spirituality; instead it emphasizes the effective integration of spirituality in all dimension of psychotherapy process: therapeutic alliance, assessment, case conceptualization, intervention, and termination".

This Bachelor's thesis was executed as a project. The purpose was to create a booklet which would explain in a simplistic way what bloodless surgery encompasses and the type of care and patient teaching required by the nurse. The objective of this project was to inform future nursing students of the possibilities of bloodless medicine and to introduce them to the field. In this way they can be prepared for working life in case they meet the patient requesting this type of care since this is an ever growing field. The theoretical basis for this thesis was bloodless surgical techniques and what the nurse should keep in mind. The theory section was written in English as well as the booklet. The topic was carried out by researching bloodless medicine as a whole; the procedures, the care given, and the outcomes. A benefit to risk comparison was executed so that a nurse can effectively teach the patient what could be expected from this type of operation. Further research options could include a closer examination of one or more of the phases of bloodless surgery, e.g. pre-operative, intra-operative or postoperative patient care.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases affect many people in Finland. One way to support this patient group is patient education. Since the time spent in the inpatient settings is limited, treatment and education of cardiovascular patients is currently focused mainly on the outpatient settings. This creates pressure for the nurses due to the strict time-frame and high turnover of patients. The purpose of this final project was to find evidence-based knowledge on the patient education of a cardiac patient and to implement a nursing journal club. The research questions were when and how the education for heart patients should be conducted. This final project was done in co-operation with the cardiac outpatient clinic in the University Hospital of Helsinki where the collected knowledge was presented in four journal club sessions. Data collection was done following the basics of literature review and by conducting multiple database searches. A more in-depth analysis was conducted once five most relevant articles were found. These five articles were presented to the nursing staff of cardiac outpatient clinic in Meilahti during May 2011. The issues presented in the nursing journal clubs were focused on the learning needs of cardiac patients, different kinds of patient education methods and the psychological path-way of a patient suffering from a cardiovascular illness. The focus was on going through the results of each article and discussing them together with the nurses. Based on the discussion, it became clear that most crucial points that rose from the articles chosen were taking patient's individual needs into consideration and the importance of consistent planning and documenting care.
