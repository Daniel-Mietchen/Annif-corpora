This book presents methods for systematic and methodical conceptualizing with abstract models of engineering systems, to use when needed in developing candidate solutions. The recommended engineering design process is able to support all levels of creative design engineering, based on Engineering Design Science, which also helps to explain the role of engineering in society. The book, incorporating several new insights, surveys information about systematic, methodical and intuitive design engineering, thinking and reasoning, and progressive development of products. The general process should also be attractive to top-level managers and chief engineering designers. This book is intended for engineering students at all levels of higher education – taught courses or self-study. -Publisher
