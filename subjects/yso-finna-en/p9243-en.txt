irony
Humour in English everyday life
From romantic irony to postmodernist metafiction : a contribution to the history of literary self-reflexivity in its philosophical context
Modern irony is a Romantic flash of genius. Initially discussed as an ethical problem, it fully develops in the quintessentially modern genre of the novel, from the early 19th century via classical modernism to postmodernity. Also examining how thinkers identify the political contradictions of the 20th century as ironical, this book offers a comprehensive account of the constitutive irony of modernity's ethical, poetical, and political logic --

This thesis is written as an assignment for Bellcrest Translations Ltd. There was no requirement for any specific subject, so on the basis of interest in British culture, English humour was chosen as the subject. The objective of the thesis is to understand English culture and humour, and how humour appears in its various forms in English everyday life and communication. The thesis is not about comedy. One of the aims is the usefulness of the thesis to those leaving for England, for example, to study or work. The thesis is mainly based on written material. Interviews and email messages have been used as empirical material; they have been studied to learn about English humour and the forms in which it appears. Personal observation is used in addition to these.  The study was started in spring 2007; the interviews were made during the spring and summer 2007, and the email messages are also from that period. Other material has been gradually processed from spring 2007 to spring 2009.  Humour is very important part of English culture and English everyday life and communication. There are various types of humour. It may be difficult for a foreigner to understand English humour, but understanding it is very important part of adapting to English culture.

How to be a woman
This book marks a major intervention into the underexplored role of the comic in German letters.At the books heart is the relationship between the comic and irony. Weitzman argues that in the early twentieth century, irony, a key figure for the German Romantics,reemerged from its relegation to nonsense in a way that both rethought Romantic irony and dramatically extended its reach.Through readings of works by Robert Walser, Franz Kafka, and Joseph Roth, as well as theorists of the comic such as Freud, Schlegel, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Jean Paul, 'Ironys Antics' traces the development of a specifically comic irony, a play with irony that is itself the condition for all play. It thus constitutes a significant advance in German literary history and shows how the question of the comic has been and continues to be decisive for modern thought.

Irony and the logic of modernity
The use of irony in music is just beginning to be defined and critiqued, although it has been used, implied and decried by composers, performers, listeners and critics for centuries. Irony in popular music is especially worthy of study because it is pervasive, even fundamental to the music, the business of making music and the politics of messaging. Contributors to this collection address a variety of musical ironies found in the 'notes themselves,' in the text or subtext, and through performance, reception and criticism. The chapters explore the linkages between irony and the comic, the tragic, the remembered, the forgotten, the co-opted, and the resistant. From the nineteenth to twenty-first centuries, through America, Europe and Asia, this provocative range of ironies course through issues of race, religion, class, the political left and right, country, punk, hip hop, folk, rock, easy listening, opera and the technologies that make possible our pop music experience. This interdisciplinary volume creates new methodologies and applies existing theories of irony to musical works that have made a cultural or political impact through the use of this most multifaceted of devices.

On our mind : salience, context, and figurative language
Waiting for Foucault, still
Irony and theatre share intimate kinships, not only regarding dramatic conflict, dialectic or wittiness, but also scenic structure and the verbal or situational ironies that typically mark theatrical speech and action. Yet irony today, in aesthetic, literary and philosophical contexts especially, is often regarded with skepticism - as ungraspable, or elusive to the point of confounding. Countering this tendency, Storm advocates a wide-angle view of this master trope, exploring the ironic in major works by playwrights including Chekhov, Pirandello and Brecht, and in notable relation to well-known representative characters in drama from Ibsen's Halvard Solness to Stoppard's Septimus Hodge and Wasserstein's Heidi Holland. To the degree that irony is existential, its presence in the theatre relates directly to the circumstances and the expressiveness of the characters on stage. This study investigates how these key figures enact, embody, represent and personify the ironic in myriad situations in the modern and contemporary theatre.
