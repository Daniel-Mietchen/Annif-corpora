Poetry therapy : interface of the arts and psychology
"Poetry therapy has been widely recognized as a valuable form of treatment for over thirty years, and has been proven effective worldwide with many diverse clients. Written by a pioneer and a consistent leader in the field, 'Poetry Therapy: Theory and Practice' presents a unified model for the effective practice of poetry therapy. Based on his wealth of clinical and theoretical knowledge, Dr Nicholas Mazza outlines a tripartite system composed of receptive, expressive, and symbolic modes of practice. Now available in a paperback edition, this text serves as a primary resource for any serious practitioner interested in poetry therapy, bibliotherapy, writing and healing, or the broader area of creative/expressive arts therapies." -- (Back Cover)
