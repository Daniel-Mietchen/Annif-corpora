This volume contains a collection of twenty-one essays of John S. Kloppenborg, with four foci: conceptual and methodological issues in the Synoptic Problem; the Sayings Gospel Q; the Gospel of Mark; and the Parables of Jesus. Kloppenborg, a major contributor to the Synoptic Problem, is especially interested in how one constructs synoptic hypotheses, always aware of the many gaps in our knowledge, the presence of competing hypotheses, and the theological and historical entailments in any given hypothesis. Common to the essays in the remaining three sections is the insistence that the literature, thought and practices of the early Jesus movement must be treated with a deep awareness of their social, literary, and intellectual contexts. The context of the early Jesus movement is illumined not simply by resort to the literary and historical sources produced by Greek and Roman elites but, more importantly, by data gathered from documentary sources available in non-literary papyri.

A critical and exegetical commentary on the Gospel according to St. Mark
This volume contains a comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis that the Gospel of Mark has been influenced by the theology of the apostle Paul. It discusses the history of this view from the nineteenth century to the modern day, analyses possible historical connections between the apostle and the evangelist, and compares and contrasts many major theological themes in both the epistles and the Gospel. This important collection of essays will be of major significance in the growing debate over Pauline influence on the Gospel of Mark.

"I am" in John's Gospel : literary function, background and theological implications
Mark Husbands and Daniel J. Treier bring together notable evangelical scholars and teachers to address from biblical, historical, theological and ecumenical perspectives key questions that prevent complete unity between Roman Catholic and Protestant branches of the church and raise tensions even among Protestant denominations. Witnessing to certain signs of hope, these essays also acknowledge points of caution. But for every reader who is looking for guidance and orientation to this doctrine and current discussion, this book provides a wealth of charitable yet incisive insight. Key questions addressed include: does the doctrine of imputation of Christ's righteousness need to be rethought, or does it faithfully reflect biblical teaching; how should the faith and transformation of the believer be understood in connection with our justification; what is the connection between our union with Christ and justification; what can we learn from Lutheran, Wesleyan and Anglican perspectives on justification; what does the Lutheran-Catholic Joint Declaration of 1999 contribute to current ecumenical discussions, and what prospects are there for real theological and ecclesiological reconciliation?

John among the Gospels
This third volume of 'Understanding What One Reads' includes forty-two studies of the New Testament. The three volumes cover 1992-2003 (I); 2003-2011 (II) and 2011-2014 (III). Though for the most part the content of this third volume falls under the category of responses to recent scholarly books or articles, some conference papers directed toward more general audience are included. In this volume Lambrecht continues his defense of the thesis of Mark's dependence on Q. In addition, a major subdivision reflects on Paul. At the end of this third book there is provided a canonical list of his English articles written between 1992-2014 from 'Collected Studies on Pauline Literature and the Book on Revelation' (Rome, 2001) as well as those in the three volumes of 'Understanding What One Reads'. These additional features will facilitate endeavors to follow the chronological development of Professor Lambrecht's thought.

Whether he is asking about the role of New Testament exegesis among other academic disciplines, the suppression of anger in Pauline writings, or at what point came to designate a written "Gospel," James A. Kelhoffer's patient and careful exegesis provides an intriguing lens through which to view early Christianity. Many struggles of early Christ believers, he finds, reflect intra-ecclesial struggles to establish the legitimacy of a view or a religious leader vis-aÃÄ-vis competing ideologies or leaders. Those already familiar with Kelhoffer's Miracle and Mission (2000), The Diet of John the Baptist (2005) and Persecution, Persuasion and Power (2010) will find in this volume refreshing insights suggested but not developed in his other books.
