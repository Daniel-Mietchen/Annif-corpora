stamps and imprints
The purpose of this work is to determine the most informative articles and the most effective methods and research approaches to the study of Roman brick stamps covering the former Roman Empire. The different research methods used in different areas are compared. This study attempts to give an overall view of research methods, approaches and categories of studies used in all schools of brick stamp research and poses the question whether brick stamps can contribute to our understanding of military history. Regional and local differences of both stamps and modern schools of research are highlighted and their importance in terms of Roman history is discussed.

The Roman stamped tiles of Vindonissa (1st century A.D., Northern Switzerland) : provenance and technology of production - an archaeometric study
The destruction of Pompeii in AD 79 provides a unique opportunity to explore the use of everyday items. It allows us to identify the source and variety of products available within the city, and enables us to track changes in the consumption of goods over time. In this volume, Jaye McKenzie-Clark presents the far-reaching results of her examination of the red slip tableware within three regions of the city. It pinpoints the initial supply and use of Vesuvian Sigillata, and investigates factors that may have led to the popularity of this style of pottery. The investigation maps the on-going manufacture of these ceramics and identifies changes in production and consumption up to the time of the eruption. Examination of the distribution within contexts of different social use also reveals distinct patterns of consumer demands and consumption within Pompeian society. Such research helps us to explore and understand the use of goods within the city of Pompeii and throughout the Roman world, and also has the potential to shed light on patterns of behaviour in modern consumer societies.

This work presents an archaeometric study on the Vindonissa stamped tiles. Vindonissa (Canton of Aargau, Switzerland) was an important Roman camp during the 1st century AD. With Vindonissa stamped tiles, archaeologists refer to all tiles stamped with the name of the military units that were stationed at Vindonissa from 47 to 101 AD. These tiles are among the most common archaeological findings in the Vindonissa legionary camp, but commonly occur in different Roman sites of Switzerland. The principal aim of this study was the petrographic and chemical characterisation of the Vindonissa tiles to determine the production site (or sites) for these ceramics and to obtain information concerning the technological aspects of the tile production and the distribution of these stamped tiles in Switzerland in Roman times.

A study of Roman brick-stamps
Brickstamps of Constantinople provides archaeologists and historians with the first major catalogue and analysis of stamped bricks manufactured in Constantinople and its vicinity in the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. The catalogue assembles not only all previously published stamps but also a large amount of unpublished material in archives and museum collections. Most of the variant stamps are illustrated with a sketch, drawing or photograph. The text discusses the organization of the brickmaking industry and the purpose of brickstamping, and establishes for the first time a chronological framework for the material. On the basis of the conclusions, dates are proposed for previously undated structures in the city, and revised dates are given for other monuments.
