Manual for training of extension workers and farmers : alternatives to methyl bromide for soil fumigation
This book extensively covers the different types of biomass (e.g. molasses, sugar beet pulp, cheese whey, sugarcane residues, palm waste, vegetable oil, straws, stalks and wood), various pretreatment approaches (e.g. physical, thermal, chemical, physicochemical and biological) and methods that show the subsequent production of biofuels and chemicals such as sugars, ethanol, extracellular polysaccharides, biodiesel, gas and oil. In addition to traditional methods such as steam, hot-water, hydrothermal, diluted-acid, organosolv, ozonolysis, sulfite, milling, fungal and bacterial, microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, torrefaction, pelletization, gasification (including biogas) and liquefaction pretreatments, it also introduces and discusses novel techniques such as nano and solid catalysts, organic electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids. This book offers a review of state-of-the-art research and provides guidance for the future paths of developing pretreatment techniques of biomass for biofuels, especially in the fields of biotechnology, microbiology, chemistry, materials science and engineering.

Economic evaluation of a synthetic natural gas production plant using indirect gasification of lignocellulosic biomass
"An important goal of the extended use of biomass is replacing fossil fuels. Potentially, all global energy needs can be covered with biomass if the utilization is efficient enough. This book provides the state of the art in the field of efficient conversion of biomass, covering most technical issues such as combustion, gasification, torrefaction, pyrolysis, pelletizing and biogasproduction. The book combines a thorough description of interesting new technologies and the basic principles and tools to be used in future process optimization work. The wide coverage of examples from all over the world will make the book important as a text book on the subject"--
