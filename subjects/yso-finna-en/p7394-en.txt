Almost three tons of concrete are produced each year for every person on the planet; only water is consumed more per head of population. Now used almost universally in modern construction, concrete polarizes opinion: provoking intense loathing and even nausea in some, it is regarded by others with a messianic passion. Concrete and Culture breaks new ground by studying concrete's effects on culture rather than its technical properties. Adrian Forty examines the ways concrete has changed our understanding of 'nature', of time, even of 'material'. While the book concentrates upon architects' responses to concrete, because they have had most to say about the medium, it also takes into account the role concrete has played in politics, in literature, in cinema, in labour-relations, and in present day arguments about sustainability. Politicians, entrepreneurs, clerics, photographers, artists, and filmmakers have all taken advantage of concrete for purposes of their own. Covering Europe, North America, South America and the Far East, Concrete and Culture asks to what degree concrete has been responsible for modernist uniformity and looks at the debates it has engendered. The first reflection on the global consequences of concrete, the book offers a new way of looking at our environment over the past one hundred years.
Concrete architecture in Finland
"This book examines the various problems caused by non-uniform deformation changes, poor durability, and natural and human disasters such as earthquakes and fire. Attention is given to the causes and mechanisms of the deterioration." "Students and academics worldwide will find this an invaluable source of information. It is also useful as a practical tool book for concrete and structural engineering professionals."--BOOK JACKET.

Beton brut or 'Raw concrete' was a term coined by Le Corbusier and appropriated by two young British architects in the 1950s to describe a new kind of building: austere, unadorned, monolithic, confrontational and constructed almost entirely in concrete. Brutalist architecture blossomed in Britain in the second half of the twentieth century, with planners favouring its functionality and low costs for social housing projects, government buildings and shopping centres. But as the school spread, so its reputation foundered, with Brutalism quickly becoming synonymous with crime, economic deprivation and inner-city decay. In the twenty-first century, Brutalist buildings are just as prominent, and just as pilloried - seen by many as 'spiky survivors of the sixties'. But there is another side to Brutalism, one of artistic vision, political idealism and painstaking attention to detail: a school of architecture to celebrate, not destroy. 'Raw concrete' provides a groundbreaking history of the heavy-concrete architecture of post-war Britain, as well as a personal and illuminating guide to eight pivotal Brutalist buildings. Beginning in a tiny concrete hermitage on the remote north Scottish coast, and ending up backstage at the National Theatre, 'Raw concrete' takes us on a wide-ranging journey through Britain over the past sixty years, stopping to examine how these buildings were made - from commission to construction - why they have been so hated, and why they should be loved.

Packed with case studies highlighting construction companies that regularly recycle between 70% and 95% of concrete from their waste streams, this book presents practical, up-to-date information about concrete's history in the green building movement, state of the art methodologies, and current best practices. Using the USGBC LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building assessment standard, the book covers site, energy, water, materials, indoor environmental quality, construction, and demolition waste protocols and provides information on tracking the LEED requirements to assure timely building certification. It also addresses non-LEED issues, such as flo od and fire protection benefits.

Providing the most recent information about concrete's history in the green building movement, state-of-the-art methodologies and best practices, this book may be considered a textbook for university courses and industry education; a handbook to help building owners obtain green certification; a reference for industry professionals seeking an overview of the subject of concrete and green buildings; and as a guide to professionals in the building materials/products industries. The concept of green buildings is in the process of emerging from a decade long effort to define itself, and this book offers an overview of all of the available information.
