The flow of academic ideas in the area of computational intelligence is impacting industrial practice at considerable speed. Practitioners face the challenge of tracking, understanding and applying the latest techniques, which often prove their value even before the underlying theories are fully understood. This book offers realistic guidelines on creating value from the application of computational intelligence methods. In Part I, the author offers simple explanations of the key computational intelligence technologies: fuzzy logic, neural networks, support vector machines, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and intelligent agents. In Part II, he defines the typical business environment and analyzes the competitive advantages these techniques offer. In Part III, he introduces a methodology for effective real-world application of computational intelligence while minimizing development cost, and he outlines the critical, underestimated technology marketing efforts required.The methodology can improve the existing capabilities of Six Sigma, one of the most popular work processes in industry. Finally, in Part IV the author looks to technologies still in the research domain, such as perception-based computing, artificial immune systems, and systems with evolved structure, and he examines the future for computational intelligence applications while taking into account projected industrial needs. The author adopts a light tone in this book, visualizes many of the techniques and ideas, and supports the text with notes from successful implementations. This book is ideal for engineers implementing these techniques in the real world, managers charged with creating value and reducing costs in the related industries, and scientists in computational intelligence looking towards the application of their research..

Amongst friends in computers and law : a collection of essays in remembrance of Guy Vandenberghe
In the present world of rapidly developing technologies, Artificial Intelligence has gained a reputation of the most fascinating field of research. More and more scientists become interested in it and the subareas of AI are continually growing. The thesis discusses various approaches of Artificial Intelligence development. However, the major part of the work concentrates on logical programming studying and examination of Artificial Inetlligence applications such as expert systems. The reason these particular areas of Artificial Intelligence were chosen to be studied in detail is explained by availability of comprehensive literature and materials as well as a personal interest in the subject. In the modern time of rich markets and productions, experts in problem domains are in a great demand. Experts systems are built on the basis of an expert's knowledge and are aimed to provide people with consultations at any time and place. The objective of the study is to build an example of an expert system that deals with aspects of knowledge representation and to demonstrate a practical implementation of an AI system. The system has to be able to interact with non-professional users and give sufficient advice about the choice of tablet model. Before the implementation of the system, general issues about Artificial Intelligence system structure, development of expert systems and logical programming are studied. The methodology of logical programming is explained, after which Prolog, a representative of logical programming, is introduced. The system created in the practical part of the study is an example of Artificial Intelligence application and demonstrates an example of common expert system. Such systems are realized in a real environment and are used as a separate application or a part of complex structures.
