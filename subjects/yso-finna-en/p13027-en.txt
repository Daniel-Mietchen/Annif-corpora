"This book investigates the practical and ritual dimensions of trees and timber in the Bronze Age and Iron Age of Scandinavia. The arguments are developed through the study of a broad range of materials including rock-art images depicting trees, charcoal from archaeological contexts identified to species, and prehistoric long-houses. The archaeological remains are related to a wider discussion in anthropology and historical ecology concerning the multifaceted relationship between humans and trees"--P. 65

World rock art : the primordial language
The article considers the light shed on ancient religion by comparative linguistics and the analysis of visual images. Its starting point is the Bronze Age 'Sun Chariot' from Trundholm in Denmark, which is considered in both Flemming Kaul's book Ships on Bronzes and Martin West's Indo-European Poetry and Myth . The ideas of these two writers are discussed in conncection with the evidence of prehistoric rock carvings in South Scandinavia. The article considers how such places were used and draws attention to the distinctive practice of depicting pairs of footprints in this medium. The footprints may mark the positions of people engaged in rituals at these sites, for in many cases the drawings are oriented towards the solstices. Perhaps these events were observed from the decorated outcrops. Although the field evidence is limited, it supports the idea of a solar cosmology postulated by Kaul and West.

Theoretical perspectives in rock art research
"Shadows of a Northern Past is the outcome of a prolonged period of discovery and research into the Bronze Age rock carvings of Bohuslan (Sweden) and Ostfold (Norway). Over 100 of the most complex and varied sites, containing many thousands of images, are presented in new plans and photographs by John Coles. The variety and precision of the methods of recording have revealed hitherto unknown carvings and new details on many of the sites, including some of the best-known sites in all of Sweden and Norway. The records made by the author over the past thirty years also include aspects of the carvings that are now diminished by erosion and other factors." "The images carved within the whole region are described and illustrated, and their individuality is stressed. The images, including boats, humans, wheeled vehicles, wild and domesticated animals, ards, weapons and other symbols, demonstrate great variability. Here, John Coles seeks to identify particular artists whose work appears within and between different sites and explores the potential of boat images in particular for an improved chronology. He also examines the composition of sites, their development over time and the organisation of their internal structures, as well as exploring the choice of surface for carving, the parameters of location, outlook and expression of artistry, and the likely responses of the viewers. Current excavation programmes being undertaken at the base of sites are also outlined." "The carving sites and their contemporary monuments are mapped and described in terms of evolving landscapes of the period 1500-300 B.C. The book includes more than 100 site plans at uniform scale, 25 maps and 160 photographs and detailed line drawings."--BOOK JACKET.
