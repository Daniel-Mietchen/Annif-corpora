The seventy-seven poems that form Meta KuA'ar's "Ljubljana" pay complex homage to her home city, the Slovenian capital. Although her vision of Ljubljana begins with places, buildings, bridges - the city the visitor sees - the poet very soon takes us to the insider's Ljubljana, a personal space alive with associations and images, rich with references. As she senses the depths and inter-connections under the city's skin, the city becomes a place of mind and memory, almost an extension of her body. At the same time, KuA'ar leads us into a wider meditation on the links between who and where we are, and between present experience and cultural heritage. In this beautifully modulated translation, and with introductory material that guides us through unfamiliar territory, the English-language reader can savour and enjoy the work of one of Slovenia's most individualistic and highly-regarded poets for the first time.

From his First Book of Poems, Sabovnice ur (Chessboards of Hours), published in 1995 when he was twenty-two-years old, Ales Steger has been considered one of Slovenia's most promising poets. That promise has been unleashed over the course of a decade and a half, through three more books of poetry (Kashmir, Protuberauces, and The Book of Things), a fictional travelogue in Peru (January in the Middle of Summer), and a collection of lyric essays (Berlin), which received the 2007 Rozanceva Award for the best book of essays written in Slovenian. The philosophical and lyrical sophistication of his poems, along with his work as a leading book editor and festival organizer, earned for Steger a reputation that quickly traveled beyond the borders of Slovenia. The international reach of his work seems appropriate considering its international concerns and refusal to acknowledge limits to, or boundaries of, art, thought, even genre. Although grounded in and growing from his hometown of Ptuj, Steger's work in multiple genres, and on many fronts, testifies to his growing stature as one of Central Europe's most essential literary figures."--Brian Henry from the Introduction --Book Jacket.
