"The outdoor area is now an integral part of many early years settings and schools, but is it being used to its full potential? This book clearly explains the learning potential of the outdoor environment and practically demonstrates how the 'Outdoor Classroom' can be developed in early years settings and schools. Drawing on the Forest School approach, it aims to inspire teachers and practitioners to think creatively about their outside area and how they can provide rich play opportunities for children that will further their learning regardless of any time, space or financial restraints. Emphasising the importance of continuity for young children, the book shows how good practice in the early years can be built on in Reception and Key Stage 1 and covers: What is the outdoor classroom and how does it enhance children's learning? How experiences in the Outdoor Classroom can support the early years and Key Stage 1 curricula The implications for schools using the outdoor classroom including resources, timetabling, space, parental and staff opposition Guidance on planning Activities and ideas for using the Outdoor Classroom Including practical examples and detailed case studies taken from a wide range of settings and schools, this handy text will help you to get the most out of your outside area"--

The reform of the CAP and other significant changes in countryside policies have given rise to a fundamental reassessment of the ways in which we use our rural land. In this book, Nigel Curry gives a full critical appraisal of policies and plans for countryside recreation and access. He proposes, in the context of rural restructuring, a range of new directions for policy and planning that will better serve the needs of the public and the countryside alike. Countryside Recreation, Access and Land Use Planning is structured around five main propositions: that the fragmented way in which agencies responsible for rural leisure are organized has inhibited the development of coherent policies and plans; that there has been a confusion between the responsibilities of the public sector and those of the market place and provision has been piecemeal and uncoordinated as a result; that policies and plans have, in the main, ignored the social composition of recreation participation and have failed to take people's preferences into account; that policy and planning have been concerned with the rights of the landowner and a fear of a recreation explosion rather than the development of recreation opportunities and as such, have been unduly restrictive; and that policies and plans for recreation and access have been given an unjustifiably low priority in pressures for change in the countryside, particularly in relation to those in the conservation interest.

"The first curricular-focused outdoor learning textbook for prospective and practising K-12 teachers, this book provides both academic justification and practical support for educators working in a wide variety of environments and with diverse populations of students to incorporate more meaningful outdoor learning opportunities into their daily teaching activities. Learning Outside the Classroom is not a set of prescriptive activities that can be read and used uncritically. The idea of adaptation for personal relevance is central. All teachers are capable of enhancing their students' learning experiences by systematically and progressively incorporating ventures outside the classroom into their lessons. The principles and examples presented in this book are intended to be adapted by teachers to suit the needs of their students in ways that draw upon content offered by the local landscape and its natural and built heritage. Nor is this book just about outdoor learning; it's about good teaching -- wherever it takes place. It is about helping teachers devise and use the tools with which they can address the largely uncontested assumption that legitimate learning only occurs within four walls. Learning outside the classroom affords teachers the privilege of helping and the joy of observing students in a process of intellectual, emotional, and social growth that can last a lifetime"-- Provided by publisher.
