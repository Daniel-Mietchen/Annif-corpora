In mobile communications technology, increasing demand for faster connection speeds requires more from next generation mobile networks. 3GPP is a partnership organization consisting of many corporations which have interest in the future of mobile communication technology and is responsible for specifying the next generation cellular system. This next generation system is known as LTE-Advanced, and is an evolution of the original LTE system. To achieve faster transfer of data, an increase in transmission bandwidth is considered essential. This increase of transmission bandwidth is possible with Carrier Aggregation. In LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation, multiple LTE carriers can be combined to widen transmission bandwidth. However, with certain frequency band configurations there would be harmonic relation between bands used to aggregate carriers. This harmonic issue would cause sensitivity degradation in User Equipment (UE). In this thesis the harmonic issue with band configuration of 4 and 17 was examined. The goal was to find the worst case scenario for sensitivity degradation and see if it correlated with what was specified by 3GPP. UE sensitivity was measured with different power levels and bandwidths of artificially created LTE SC-FDMA 3rd harmonic distortion. Sensitivity was also measured by sweeping a continuous wave (CW) carrier across the channel used by the receiver of the UE to see if some parts of the channel would be more sensitive to interference than others. The results of these measurements confirm that 3GPP specifications for the band configuration and harmonic issue in LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation are correct. This thesis was carried out for Nokia Corporation to support the international 3GPP standardization process.

Sharing is emerging as one of the megatrends influencing future business opportunities, and wireless communications is no exception to this development. Future mobile broadband networks will operate on different types of spectrum bands including shared spectrum, which calls for changes in the operation and management of the networks. The creation and capture of value by the different players in the mobile broadband ecosystem is expected to change due to regulation, technology, and business landscape related drivers that concern not only spectrum sharing, but also sharing of other resources such as infrastructure, technologies, or data. This thesis examines the key business and technology enablers needed to exploit spectrum sharing in mobile broadband networks, and presents the business model characteristics and strategic choices that spectrum sharing concepts support. Action research and integral scenarios methodologies were applied for strategic and business analysis utilizing the capacity and expertise of the policy, business and technology research communities. The thesis introduces a new approach to analyze the scalability of the spectrum sharing concepts and their business model elements utilizing sharing economy antecedent factors. The results indicate that all analyzed sharing concepts meet basic requirements to scale. The Licensed Shared Access (LSA) leverages existing assets and capabilities of the mobile network operator domain, the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) extends the business model dynamics from connectivity to content, context and commerce, and the hybrid usage of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band by Digital Terrestrial TV (DTT) and downlink Long Term Evolution (LTE) (HUHF) enables new collaborative opportunities between converging communication, Internet and media domains. The thesis validates the feasibility of spectrum sharing between mobile broadband networks and other types of incumbent spectrum users utilizing Finnish cognitive radio field trial environment (CORE), and expands the notion of spectrum sharing beyond the mobile broadband domain to be applied to other wireless systems including the media and broadcasting. The presented results can be used in developing the future mobile broadband systems enhanced with innovative spectrum sharing enabled business models to cope with the growing demand for capacity and new services by humans and machines.
