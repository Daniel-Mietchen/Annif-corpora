Transforming health care organisations : Regional Health Care Service Network
"In 2010, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe adopted an ambitious five-year vision of better health in the WHO European Region. The WHO Regional Office for Europe and the 53 countries it serves therefore agreed to follow a roadmap with specific milestones, to enable the Regional Office to respond to the changing European environment and to further strengthen it as an evidence-based centre of health policy and public health excellence that could better support the Region's diverse Member States. The work and achievements over the last four years required great effort, commitment and cooperation from all parties: the Secretariat and Member States that comprise WHO in Europe, which in turn is part of one WHO worldwide, and all WHO's partners in the Region. Several publications give highlights of the first two years of this journey. This book covers the second two years, which include the halfway point of the period covered by the vision. It describes how all parties are making their vision a reality, to secure better health for everyone in Europe." -- (WHO Europe)
