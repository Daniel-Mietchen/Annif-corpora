In this study, early bilingual language acquisition was explored from the age of 12 to 36 months in 10 hearing children of Deaf parents, KODAs (Kids of Deaf Adults). KODA children's language acquisition is bimodal; they acquire simultaneously sign language in visual-gestural and spoken language in auditory-vocal modality. This study aimed to describe the developmental paths of early bilingual language acquisition and their interrelationships with language input. Additionally, the characteristics of children's language use and their associations with the features of the linguistic environment, child's language competence and contextual variables were examined.Information about the children's linguistic environment was collected with parental interviews. Children's linguistic development (productive vocabulary) was measured with the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) in both Finnish Sign Language (FinSL) and the Finnish language between the ages of 12 to 30 months. Children's development in the Finnish language was tested at the age of 36 months by using the Reynell Developmental Language Scales III. Additionally, the children's interaction was video recorded twice a year between the ages of 12 to 36 months during three different play sessions: with their Deaf parent, with the Deaf parent and a hearing adult and with the hearing adult alone.A large variation was uncovered in both the amount and type of language input and the children's bilingual developmental paths. According to the results of the MCDI, KODA children's (N = 8) mean size of productive vocabulary in both languages separately was smaller when compared to the monolingual norms. However, in all but three children, their total vocabulary, which includes both productive vocabulary of FinSL and Finnish, was comparable with age peers. According to the Reynell test in Finnish, three children scored at age level, three within –1 SD and two children within –2 SD.Contextual variables clearly influenced the KODA children's language use. KODA children, as young as 12 months old, accommodated their use of language and communication modes according to the language(s) of their interlocutor(s). Children preferred to code-mix when communicating with their Deaf parent by producing simultaneous, mainly semantically congruent signs and words.

The emergence over the last 10 years of the analytic concept, 'Translanguaging', has had a forceful impact on the field of Applied Linguistics. This book addresses how it has contributed to our understandings of language, bilingualism and education. Ofelia Garcia and Li Wei trace the development of the theory of Translanguaging and consider its relationship with traditional theories and models of language and bilingualism. Based on practices by students and teachers in a variety of educational contexts, this book describes how Translanguaging is used by bilingual learners to learn and by teachers to teach. Ultimately, the book affirms the transformative nature of Translanguaging; it involves the act of languaging between and beyond systems that have previously been described as separate, and in so doing, new meanings emerge and new understandings are generated, transforming not only semiotic systems and speaker subjectivities, but also social structures.
Trade schools, universities, and programs for international students have begun to experiment with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) as a viable pedagogy for instruction, as the pedagogy of CLIL increasingly gains recognition as a practical form of language and content education in Europe and beyond, and its application in instructional settings becomes more diverse. Corresponding with CLIL's growth, this book focuses on foreign language use during peer interactions in a new CLIL setting. It particularly concentrates on how to conduct research when the focus is on learner interactions. The theoretical background, research methods, and research instruments are explained in a brief and understandable manner. This book is intended for those interested in CLIL and peer interactions and includes a framework and ideas for investigating new CLIL contexts in a practical manner allowing undergraduate and graduate students to conduct their own research in these settings.
