Two specimens of Mangora acalypha (Walckenaer, 1802) were found in a rich pine fen in Hammarland on the Åland Islands in 2015. The possible connection of global climate change with five recently (within the last 15 years) recorded araneid species as new to Finland is discussed. These are, in addition to M. acalypha, Agalenatea redii (Scopoli, 1763), Argiope bruennichi (Scopoli, 1772), Larinioides sclopetarius (Clerck, 1757), Neoscona adianta (Walckenaer, 1802).

In this volume New Zealand theologian Rosalene Bradbury throws light on these-surprisingly contentious-questions. She argues convincingly that tethered to the tradition that gave rise to it, the term theologia crucis references a theological system centered around notions of false and true glory, and an ancient conviction that from the cross of Jesus Christ comes a revelatory and a saving Word. The apostle Paul, Athanasius, a school of medieval mystics, and the Reformer Martin Luther, are all shown to be significant classical representatives of these ideas. Bradbury then argues that seminal twentieth-century theologian Karl Barth exhibits many of the classical crucicentric system's defining characteristics, so that he himself might fairly be deemed a modern theologian of the cross. Until now Barth's pivotal role in this long, thin, crucicentric tradition has been unsung. This book thus sheds important new light on Barth's theology.

The Hakenkreuz, or broken cross, became the vivid icon under which Adolph Hitler united his destitute and pride-starved nation. As Der Führer, supreme leader of the Reich, Hitler rejoiced that the swastika was openly displayed in churches throughout Germany. Confused at first by their responsibilities, then deceived by their pride, many church leaders capitulated to the wave of nationalism that swept the cross of Jesus Christ from its rightful place. Others did not -- and paid the ultimate price for upholding the truth. Erwin W. Lutzer explores the story of Hitler's cross -- how a whole race of people so in need of a champion found little help from the church of Christ and so invited the judgment of God. - Jacket.

The award-winning first edition of "The Promise of Mediation," published ten years ago, is a landmark classic that changed the field's understanding of the theory and practice of conflict intervention. That volume first articulated the "transformative model" of mediation, which greatly humanized the vision of how the mediation process could help parties in conflict. In the past decade, the transformative model has proved itself and gained increasing acceptance. It is now being used in such diverse arenas as workplace, community, family, organizational, and public policy conflicts, among others. In this new edition, the authors draw on a decade of work in theory development, training, practice, research, and assessment to present a thoroughly revised and updated account of the transformative model of mediation and its practical application, including a compelling description of how the field has moved toward increasing acceptance of the transformative model a new and clearer presentation of the theory and practices of transformative mediation, with many concrete examples a new case study that provides a vivid picture of the model in practice, with a commentary full of new information about how to use it effectively clarifications of common misconceptions about the model a vision for the future that shows how the model can coexist with other approaches and where the "market" for transformative mediation is emerging This volume is a foundational resource on transformative practice, for both readers of the first edition and new readers - including mediators, facilitators, lawyers, administrators, human resource professionals, policymakers, and conflictresolution researchers and educators. More generally, this book will strike a chord with anyone interested in humanizing our social institutions and building on a relational vision of society.
