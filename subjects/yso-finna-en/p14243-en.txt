Short-term economic trends and prospects; Borrowing and lending instruments looked at in the context of the Community's financial instruments
In the age of digital music it seems striking that so many of us still want to produce music concretely with our bodies, through the movement of our limbs, lungs and fingers, in contact with those materials and objects which are capable of producing sounds. The huge sales figures of musical instruments in the global market, and the amount of time and effort people of all ages invest in mastering the tools of music, make it clear that playing musical instruments is an important phenomenon in human life. By combining the findings made in music psychology and performative ethnomusicology, Marko Aho shows how playing a musical instrument, and the pleasure musicians get from it, emerges from an intimate dialogue between the personally felt body and the sounding instrument. An introduction to the general aspects of the tactile resources of musical instruments, musical style and the musician is followed by an analysis of the learning process of the regional kantele style of the Perho river valley in Finnish Central Ostrobothnia.

Employing a task-based approach, the book offers step-by-step guidance to the current techniques and materials used in dental technology. As well as providing thorough instruction as to core competencies in impression handling, model production, tray construction, articulators and facebows, the book introduces the reader to the basics of more specific and/or specialist areas of practice, such as complete and partial denture prosthetics, fixed prosthodontics, orthodontic work, maxillo-facial technology, occlusion and implants. The book also provides an excellent ready reference to instruments, equipment and key terms as well as advice on establishing effective communication within the dental team and study tips"--Provided by publisher.

"Basic Guide to Dental Instruments provides a working inventory of dental instrumentation in common use in dental surgeries. A clear photograph of each class and many varieties of instrument is included, and then described according to the following principles: name, usage, any relevant features and varieties. Each section is dedicated to a specific discipline or division of dentistry. Complete set-ups have been included at the end of most sections for various procedures. The coverage reflects instrumentation and accessory items used in general dental practice, routine hospital dental procedures and selected specialist settings. The author adopts a flexible approach which recognises that some instruments are multi-functional, and their names and usage can vary across dental surgeries. This approach, coupled with the range of instruments covered, makes the book an ideal 'portable' resource across general practice, hospital and a range of specialist settings. The book also highlights instruments which can be easily confused. In addition to detailing the classic sets of dental instruments, the importance of instrument care and sterilisation regimes is acknowledged"--Provided by publisher.
