What makes young people care about themselves, others, their communities, and their futures? In Why Theatre Matters, Kathleen Gallagher uses the drama classroom as a window into the daily challenges of marginalized youth in Toronto, Boston, Taipei, and Lucknow. An ethnographic study which mixes quantitative and qualitative methodology in an international multi-site project, Why Theatre Matters ties together the issues of urban and arts education through the lens of student engagement. Gallagher's research presents a framework for understanding student involvement at school in the context of students' families and communities, as well as changing social, political, and economic realities around the world. Taking the reader into the classroom through the voices of the students themselves, Gallagher illustrates how creative expression through theatre can act as a rehearsal space for real, material struggles and for democratic participation. Why Theatre Matters is an invigorating challenge to the myths that surround urban youth and an impressive study of theatre's transformative potential.

This yearbook is the third in an annual series of publications by the International Network for Research in Arts Education (INRAE). It provides an inclusive study of contemporary research trends in arts education. The book is based on the idea of constructing knowledge in arts education with the wisdom of the many. 104 scholars from across the world convey the zeitgeist of key issues in research in arts education through 91 entries. Various disciplines of arts education (music, art, visual arts and digital media, drama and theatre), as well as sections on interdisciplinary themes (culture, communities, teaching and learning, assessment, policy, morals, ethics and aesthetics) and methodological issues (a research section), are incorporated in a compendium for every researcher, student, teacher or artist who wants to be engaged in the recent exchange of scholarly ideas on what is considered significant by the many. The key issues represented in the book reflect images and observations that a large body of researchers consider to be essential at this point of time.

Starting drama teaching
There is no one-size-fits-all way to keep pace with the changes affecting high school students and those who educate them. That's why Joan Lazarus has gathered here the insights of hundreds of secondary school theater teachers and teaching artists on how they have responded to the shifting demands of theater education in today's schools. She paints a portrait of active, dynamic professionals who build vibrant programs and confront challenges in a variety of ways - from inclusive, interactive lessons to comprehensive programs that address the impact of poverty, race, gender, and spirituality on students' lives. In the process, she shows how real teachers bring about real change. An accessible and up-to-date guide to best practices in theater education, this expanded and revised edition encompasses new hands-on activities - drawn from the author's in-depth interviews and research.
