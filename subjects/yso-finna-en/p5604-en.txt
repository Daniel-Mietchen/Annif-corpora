"Psychology of Sustainability: An Applied Perspective examines the many psychological factors that lead to human behavioral effects on the environment. Because applied psychology is concerned with defining criteria and finding precursor variables that can be manipulated, this textbook is neatly structured to represent the principles of applied psychology. Each chapter will apply elements from a basic research area into the context of criteria specific to sustainability. Until recently, applied psychology received minimal attention from professors and professionals in sustainability. At the same time, increased interest has led many universities to offer courses on "Psychology of Sustainability." This book is the perfect text to provide an introduction to the subject. Throughout the book, readers will find new ways of framing questions related to human adaptability and evolutionary psychology. Psychology of Sustainability is ideal for students or professionals who are looking to contribute to the conversation"--

The concern that the democratic purposes of higher education, and its foundation as a public good is being undermined, together with the realization that existing structures are unsuited to addressing today's complex societal problems, and that our institutions are failing an increasingly diverse population, are all giving rise to questioning the current model of the university. This book presents the voices of a new generation of scholars, educators, and practitioners who are committed to civic renewal and the public purposes of higher education. They question existing policies, structures, and practices, and put forward new forms of engagement that can help to shape and transform higher education to align it with societal needs. The scholars featured in this book make the case for public scholarship and argue that, in order to strengthen the democratic purposes of higher education for a viable future that is relevant to the needs of a changing society, we must recognize and support new models of teaching and research, and the need for fundamental changes in the core practices, policies, and cultures of the academy. These scholars act on their values through collaboration, inclusiveness, participation, task sharing, and reciprocity in public problem solving. Central to their approach is an authentic respect for the expertise and experience that all stakeholders contribute to education, knowledge generation, and community building. This book offers a vision of the university as a part of an ecosystem of knowledge production, addressing public problems with the purpose of advancing a more inclusive, deliberative democracy; and explores the new paradigm for teaching, learning, and knowledge creation necessary to make it a reality.

The Business of Bees provided the first integrated account of diminishing bee populations, as well as other pollinators, from an interdisciplinary perspective. It explores the role of corporate responsibility and governance as they relate to this critical issue and examines what the impact will be on consumers, companies, stock markets and ultimately on global society if bee populations continue to decline at a dangerous rate. The book considers the issue of global bee population decline from a variety of disciplines, collecting the perspectives of academics in accounting, science and humanities, with those of practitioners in the finance industry. The chapters explore the impact of the rapid declines in pollinator populations on the natural world, on corporations, on the stock market and on accounting. The Business of Bees will be essential reading for those in academia, business and finance sectors and anyone invested in the future of our planet.

A multi-stakeholder perspective on sustainable marketing : studying business-society relations through action research
"This book is devoted to applying the data, methods, and theories of contemporary social science to the question of how political outcomes in democratic societies determine the quality of life that citizens experience. Benjamin Radcliff seeks to provide an objective answer to the perennial debate between Left and Right over what public policies best contribute to human beings leading positive and rewarding lives. The book thus offers an empirical answer to this perpetual question, relying on the same canons of reason and evidence required of any other issue amenable to study through social-scientific means. The analysis focuses on the consequences of three specific political issues: the welfare state and the general size of government, labor organization, and state efforts to protect workers and consumers through economic regulation. The results indicate that in each instance, the program of the Left best contributes to citizens leading more satisfying lives, and, critically, that the benefits of greater happiness accrue to everyone in society, rich and poor alike"--

Corporate social responsibility and sustainability are global issues. Many companies participate in the movement towards more sustainable operations and develop corporate social responsibility principles. The objective of this thesis was to find out what aspects have to be taken into consideration in order to manage corporate social responsibility successfully. Furthermore, it was examined how corporate social responsibility is man-aged in practice at Nanso Group Oy. Literature from different sources was gathered to form a theoretical framework. The case study method was used to gather information for the research part. At the beginning of the strategy formulation process central issues have to be selected. A company has to follow certain national and international laws when operating. Furthermore, the company has to be aware of certain risks and problems when producing abroad. Different stakeholders have to be taken into consideration when choosing the target areas for the strategy. The goals have to be defined and actions to reach the goals. Goals can be timeless or have a specific numeric goal. In addition to that, performance indicators have to be chosen in order to measure changes. Furthermore, it has to be decided how efforts regarding corporate social responsibility are communicated to company's stakeholders. According to theory, many aspects have to be taken into consideration in order to manage corporate social responsibility successfully. In practice, challenging in the corporate social responsibility strategy process was the phase where the strategy has to gain a foothold.  It had to get through to the employees with the goal that they incorporate it in their daily work. Furthermore, limited availability of resources sets challenges.

When it comes to perceptions of what is a sustainable economy and how it may be realised, companies expanding into Central and Eastern European markets face the challenge of diverse people, attitudes and history. Corporate Social Performance in Emerging Markets provides an effective tool for companies to help them engage in CSR activities and become a responsible company in CEE countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. It does this by enabling them to focus on the difference of stakeholders and their attitudes to those of Western Europe.The author, Zsofia Lakatos, provides a review of the major differences between the various CEE countries, supported by interview research from leading executives in some of the blue-chip companies already operating in the region.
Development-oriented corporate social responsibility. Volume 1. Multinational corporations and the global context
Business and its environment
The poverty and underdevelopment in a country like India calls for action. CSR, fueled by economic growth and public expectations, has the potential of becoming one of the driving forces behind development and in the longer perspective a way of achieving a sustainable society. However, this is not the only possible outcome. Although CSR seems to have a great potential to play a role in the development of society, there is no guarantee that it will actually do so. Not until firms realize the economic benefits from using CSR such as easier hiring and higher retention rates of their employees, we will see true CSR engagement. The interest in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which recognizes that companies have obligations that extend beyond short-run profit maximization to include notions of social and environmental concern, has increased considerably in recent decades. The globalization of the world economy and the related trade liberalization has brought forward a discussion of the importance of business as an actor in the development of society. Due to the vast and diverse nature of previous researches in the area, the aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how the concept of CSR is incorporated particularly in the operations of an info-tech company in India. In order to provide clarity to the issue, five interviews were procured from different IT companies all varying in size and scale of operation and all of them being located in New Delhi, India. Documentation and interviews were used as data collection methods for this thesis. The main finding of this study is that the evolving nature of CSR strategies in the Indian info-tech sector does have a positive attitude and would play an increasingly important role in developing and the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society in the near future. While at the same time the CSR agenda in India is on track to emerge as a more balanced and better integrated in terms of keeping in mind all the stakeholders point of view.

This thesis aimed to find the opinion on CSR from people living in Finland  and India. Purpose and object of thesis was to support companies who are  interested to keep good relationship with public (Indian and Finnish) and also  to support students and academic researchers who want to know the current  trends of public opinion on CSR.  The meaning of CSR was determined by looking at the literature on CSR and  the role of different international institutions on CSR. The strategy, designing  and planning of empirical research was prepared. Research quality was  maintained by employing quantitative and qualitative research methods.  Research questions were compiled covering the whole field of CSR under  twelve groups for Part A and one open question for Part B in the  questionnaire.  Part A was covered by quantitative and Part B was covered by the qualitative  research method. The data collection frames, as well as methods followed in  survey interviews and how data collection was carried out, have been  explained. Data analysis was carried out using graphical analysis for  quantitative research and content analysis for qualitative research. The  credibility of empirical results was achieved and trust was gained by  conducting graphical and content analysis.  The empirical conclusion disclosed that people had different views on CSR in  Finland and India. Discussion about the topic was ended with the terms of  'sustainable-enterprise' and 'human social security'. Interesting future  research topics were considered to include the topics of how different  enterprises value the CSR and how it is matches with people's mind-set.  The result of this thesis extended the amount of voluntary and valuable  information to all kinds of enterprises to build up their good corporate  citizenship in the society. The results of this thesis also support  non-commercial sectors to find out whether CSR ideas and principles have  reached in a right way to the mind of the public or not and whether there is  need to any improvement or development in CSR ideas and principles.

Patagonia, Inc. is one of the earth's most interesting and inspiring companies. For almost forty years, its reputation for high quality, maverick innovation, and long-term environmental responsibility has put it in a class by itself. And everything flows from Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, whose creation myth is now an American business legend. Here, Yvon Chouinard relates his and his company's story and the core philosophies that have sustained Patagonia, Inc. year in and year out. This is not another story of a successful businessman who manages on the side to do great good and have grand adventures; it's the story of a man who brought doing good and having grand adventures into the heart of his business model--and who enjoyed even more business success as a result.--From publisher description.

The goal of this thesis is to analyse the level of sustainability of one souvenir shop. The case company Maretarium is an aquarium located in Kotka, Southern Finland and beside Finnish fish; the aquarium offers customers also The Sea Shop, a souvenir shop filled with products of underwater life. Maretarium wants to follow trends and develop the shop in more a sustainable direction. Sustainable development is one of the main trends at this moment globally. This analysis presents the main aspects of sustainability and how sustainable development can be seen in souvenir business. One wide part of sustainability is Fair Trade and other green labels which encourage suppliers and retailers to pay attention to fair, ecologically and sustainably produced products. Use of recycled material is also one way to produce new products in a sustainable way. Additionally, consumer behaviour affects also retail trends and it has been researched that shopping souvenirs and buying other goods follow the same trends. Based on the analysis, the aim is to create a list of criteria to be fulfilled for sustainable souvenir shop. The analysis rests heavily on secondary data analysis. Secondary data is collected from the case company's suppliers. The souvenir shop and its level of sustainability are evaluated through its suppliers as it is one part of the aquarium's business operations. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that The Sea Shop is quite sustainable even if there are still some areas of improvement needed to increase sustainability. The case company should choose carefully its suppliers and should encourage suppliers to embrace sustainable thinking. Therefore, based on the analysis, I propose ten main principles to implement sustain-ability in a souvenir shop which I will implement at my work as the employee of Maretarium.

In recent years, corporations of all sizes and orientations have become more sensitive to social issues and stakeholder concerns, and they are collectively striving to become better corporate citizens (in some cases, urged on by shareholder pressure or government regulations). The best practices in corporate sustainability are no longer the exclusive domain of companies like Ben & Jerry's or Body Shop as they were a decade ago; now, large, multi-national companies like G.E. and Wal-Mart are leading the way with significant financial and organizational commitments to social and environmental issues. To help managers and academics keep their eye on the ever-moving target of sustainability, award-winning author and academic Marc Epstein's provides an authoritative and comprehensive guide to implementing corporate sustainability initiatives and to measuring both their social and financial impacts.

This Discussion Paper critically examines local governance in the Niger Delta and its relevance to the search for inclusive and sustainable conflict-resolution in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It critiques the existing local government system and explores the possibility of reconceptualising local governance along more inclusive, accountable and participatory lines that would institutionalise democracy, development and peace at the grassroots or community level in the troubled oil-rich region. Its originality lies in its departure from top-down perspectives, and its refocusing of attention on the oft-neglected local sites of conflict and under development. The paper will appeal to scholars, policy actors and development planners with a particular interest in developments at the African grassroots level.

"A thought-provoking investigation of an urgent issue facing American communities today, Edward C. Lorenz's book examines the intersection of corporate irresponsibility and civic engagement. At the heart of this case study is a group of firms responsible for seven of the most contaminated Superfund sites in the United States, the largest food contamination accident in U.S. history, stunning stock and financial manipulations, and a massive shift of jobs offshore. In the face of these egregious environmental, employee, and investor abuses, several communities impacted by these firms organized to confront and combat failures in corporate and bureaucratic leadership, winning notable victories over major financiers, lobbyists, and indifferent or ineffective government agencies. A critical analysis of public and private leadership, business and economic ethics, and civic life, this book concludes with a stirring blueprint for other communities facing similarly overwhelming opposition"--
