The representatives of Neo-Impressionism permanently liberated paint from the blend on the palette as well as from its traditional method of application, just as it had been revived through the atmospheric illusionism of the Impressionists. Beginning in France, the painterly revolution of the new movement-also known as Pointillism or Divisionism-stretched from the banks of the Seine to the snow-covered slopes of the Alps, from George Seurat to the Swiss artist Giovanni Giacometti. Unmixed and adhering to visual laws, the painters placed dots, spots, and lines of colour alongside each other so precisely that the human eye ultimately performs the job of blending the colours during the process of viewing. Exhibition: Fondation Pierre Arnaud, Lens, Switzerland (21.12.2013-20.4.2014).
