Throughout the pages of this collection, a wide range of voices sound the joy and fury of being in the trenches of the volatile discourse of enacting, staging, and sharing the experience of performance. The cultural workers in this book seek a revolution of heart, mind, and spirit. They question who we are and consistently ask that hospitality and its uses be placed at the center of the shared theatrical experience.

"Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is one of the most exciting and increasingly recognized concepts being used to facilitate organizational change. This book studies AI in depth, illustrating the method of asking particular questions and envisioning the future, encouraging staff to consider both the positive and negative systems in place and to recognize the need to implement change. It demonstrates how AI can be practically applied by combining the skills, perspectives and approaches presented here into a practical conversational approach to organizational challenges. It also takes a look at other techniques used to create change through conversation. Case studies from organizations that have already integrated conversational methods into their change management practice show why the processes are valuable, why they are effective, and how to generate such conversations yourself. Written in jargon-free language, this is an excellent resource for discovering the benefits that conversational techniques can have on an organization and its performance"--

The emergence of social media as one of the driving forces of consumers online experiences today also challenges our current understanding on marketing and brand management. The effects of brands social media involvement are to this day uncertain. Severin Dennhardt shows that social media and user-generated brands do have a strong influence on brands. Four independent studies demonstrate that successful brands can be created in virtual worlds, user-generated content drives the creation of unique brands, social media strongly influences the social value perception of brands, and social media impacts consumers purchase decision process.

Motivation of Crowds' Online Participation in Crowdsourcing Community : A case of XIAOMI MIUI
"Participatory Budgeting-the experiment in democracy that could redefine how public budgets are decided in the United States. Democracy Reinvented is the first comprehensive academic treatment of participatory budgeting in the United States, situating it within a broader trend of civic technology and innovation. This global phenomenon, which has been called "revolutionary civics in action" by the New York Times, started in Brazil in 1989 but came to America only in 2009. Participatory budgeting empowers citizens to identify community needs, work with elected officials to craft budget proposals, and vote on how to spend public funds. Democracy Reinvented places participatory budgeting within the larger discussion of the health of U.S. democracy and focuses on the enabling political and institutional conditions. Author and former White House policy adviser Hollie Russon Gilman presents theoretical insights, indepth case studies, and interviews to offer a compelling alternative to the current citizen disaffection and mistrust of government. She offers policy recommendations on how to tap online tools and other technological and civic innovations to promote more inclusive governance. While most literature tends to focus on institutional changes without solutions, this book suggests practical ways to empower citizens to become change agents. Democracy Reinvented also includes a discussion on the challenges and opportunities that come with using digital tools to re-engage citizens in governance"--

Participatory development and the World Bank : potential directions for change
The nineteenth century was a century of actors. The twentieth century was a century of directors. The twenty-first century is a century of spectators. With Jacques Ranciere's The Emancipated Spectator (2009) being the most discussed theatre-related text of the last decade, there is an increase in scholarly and curatorial interest in the most mysterious, potentially dangerous and, in fact, most important participant of the performance, who stays silent, motionless, and hidden in darkness: the audience. And similarly, artists desire to finally "meet the spectators": to let them speak, get into a dialogue with them, invite them to involve themselves in pursuing the performance. To liberate the audience.

Joined Forces: Audience Participation in Theatre presents various examples of audience participation in theatre linking them to problems of participation in democracy and to socially engaged art. Making theatre is always a political statement – asking about audience participation practices is asking about the possibilities of making changes both in art and in politics. The core part of the book consist of 11 essays and interviews. Artists from different countries were asked to reflect on the idea of participation, to share their experiences and write about their successes and fails, hopes and doubts. While it's impossible to create a map of participatory art, choosing (nearly) a dozen various representative and remarkable examples can help to outline the situation of contemporary political, audience-engaging theatre as seen by its creators themselves.

The threats weaved by human to natural resources have impressed all of worlds' assemblies making decisions about environmental schemes. Appearance of challenges in natural resources management presented by governmental organizations signals a new and more comprehensive approach to natural resources management. This management is the responsibility of the system including all of stakeholders, in particular local farmers. In fact, farmers' participation in natural resources conservational programs (NRCPs) can be a context for making important and active decisions relating to environmental conservation. This study has attempted to response to the question toward which factors affecting farmers' participation in NRCPs. The data collected for this study were derived through a stratified random sampling procedure from 308 farmers in Qazvin province, Iran. The multiple regression analysis revealed that factors such as age, family size, distance from Governmental Natural Resources Centers, environmental attitude, and need to extension programs relating to natural resources conservation influence directly on farmers' participation, while factors such as conservational knowledge and behavior influence indirectly on farmers' participation in NRCPs. The paper concludes that factors affecting farmers' participation present information that can be suitable for success of environmental decision making.
