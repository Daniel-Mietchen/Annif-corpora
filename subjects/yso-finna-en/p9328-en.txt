Eight examples of the application of knowledge management and intellectual capital principles are described in the case histories presented in this book. These case histories have been chosen by a panel of international experts from 70 case histories submitted to a competition for the Knowledge Management and Intellectual Capital Excellence Awards conducted by Academic Conferences and Publishing International. The authors of these eight examples have been short listed and invited to present their case history at the 16th annual European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM) held at the University of Udine in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (near Venice), Italy in September 2015. The best three case studies will be awarded a prize at the conference.

This original and instructive new book defines and explores the concept of knowledge as the talent, skills, know-how and understanding embodied in individuals. The distinguished contributors advance the current research frontier in three novel directions which focus on: the role of human capital and talent for creativity, entrepreneurship and regional development; the role of institutions for the behaviour of firms and entrepreneurs; and the influence of the global context on the location, export and innovation behaviour of firms in a knowledge economy. They also address critical questions that underpin the emerging knowledge economy: Why does human capital and talent tend to agglomerate in large urban regions? How does this agglomeration affect the location of different types of economic activities? How does this agglomeration affect regional growth? Presenting the state-of-the-art in the field of knowledge economics, this book will prove a stimulating and challenging read for scholars and researchers with an interest in economics, business and management, and regional and urban studies.

The regional economics of knowledge and talent
The regional economics of knowledge and talent : local advantage in a global context
Katz and Rapoport (2005) conclude that with linear production technology and the possibility of unilateral migration, regionspecific shocks may increase the average level of education. Previously, Poutvaara (2000) derived a corresponding result with Cobb-Douglas technology and migration which may go in both directions. This paper shows that the exit option may reduce human capital formation with a quadratic production technology.
