Questions, instructions, and modes of listening in the joint production of guided action: a study of student - teacher collaboration in handicraft education
"Originating in Finland in eighteen-sixty-five, Educational Sloyd used handicrafts practised in schools to promote educational completeness through the interdependence of the mind and body. These radical ideas spread throughout Europe and America and had a significant impact on the early development of manual training, manual arts, industrial education and technical education. Today it is generally acknowledged that Educational Sloyd laid the foundations of modern technological education. This book traces the development of Sloyd from its conception by Uno Cygnaeus and the first Sloyd school founded by Otto Salomon, to its enthusiastic take up in Scandinavia and beyond. It examines the debates and controversy which surround the Sloyd system, and considers the transition from 'hands-on' craft work to concepts of educational technology. Finally, the investigation reveals the lasting legacy of the ideas and practice of Sloyd education, and how it continues to influence educational technology. Included in the book: - the foundations of Educational Sloyd - debates, controversy and rival factions - key case studies in Finland and Iceland - the lasting legacy of Sloyd education. This fascinating and comprehensive historical exploration will be of interest to scholars and researchers in the areas of educational technology, comparative education and the history of education"--
