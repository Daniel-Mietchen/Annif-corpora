"An enormous number of literary texts engaged with the build-up towards, undertaking of and aftermath of the recent invasion of Iraq. This book both provides a survey of such texts and presents a particular critical perspective on them. Many were regarded as taking a position for or against the invasion, but this study neither attempts to hold authors to account for their political choices nor tries to reach a moral consensus on the invasion. The idea here is to examine how certain literary texts appeared within and "spoke" to a specific socio-political context, not merely to reckon with that context but to understand the condition of contemporary literature generally. Focusing primarily on literature in English made available in the U.S.A. and U.K. while debates about the Iraq invasion were uppermost in the public consciousness, texts in a wide range of forms are examined here: from poetry anthologies to individual poetry collections, plays on current events to revivals of classical plays, action thrillers to literary fiction and personal blogs"--

"The startlingly original look at life on the streets of Baghdad during the Iraq War inspired by true events arrives in a stunning new softcover edition. In this provocative graphic novel, superstar comics writer Brian K. Vaughan examines life on the streets of war-torn Iraq. In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad Zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation: Can it be given, or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity? This moving graphic novel is inspired by true events. This new Deluxe Edition hardcover presents the original graphic novel, plus developmental art and more". / Provided by publisher.

This compelling book presents an unparalleled record of what happened after U.S. forces seized Baghdad in the spring of 2003. Army Colonel Peter R. Mansoor, the on-the-ground commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Divisionthe Ready First Combat Team”describes his brigade’s first year in Iraq, from the sweltering, chaotic summer after the Ba’athists’ defeat to the transfer of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government a year later. Uniquely positioned to observe, record, and assess the events of that fateful year, Mansoor now explains what went right and wrong as the U.S. military confronted an insurgency of unexpected strength and tenacity. Drawing not only on his own daily combat journal but also on observations by embedded reporters, news reports, combat logs, archived e-mails, and many other sources, Mansoor offers a contemporary record of the valor, motivations, and resolve of the 1st Brigade and its attachments during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Yet this book has a deeper significance than a personal memoir or unit history. Baghdad at Sunrise provides a detailed, nuanced analysis of U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Iraq, and along with it critically important lessons for America’s military and political leaders of the twenty-first century.
