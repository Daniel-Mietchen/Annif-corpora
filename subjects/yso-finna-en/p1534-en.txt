What social security rights are there for illegal workers?  To what extent can health care services be refused by the beneficiary, and  to what extent can coverage of health care services be refused by social  security bodies?  This casebook is composed of two main parts. The first gives an overview  of the ways related cases were decided by national courts in a number of  European countries. In the second part the reader finds the crucial parts  of the court decisions in about sixty cases. The decisions are published in  their original language with a summary in English.  This book is useful both for further research and education. It should allow  for the development of a theory concerning judge-made social security law  and for the discovery of the specificity of legal reasoning by social security  judges. As the first of its kind, the casebook makes the teaching of legal  reasoning and the making of social security law by judges accessible to a  multinational audience. Moreover, not only law students, but also trainees  of the judiciary and novice social security judges will benefit from this  casebook.
