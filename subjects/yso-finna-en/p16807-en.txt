For Emmy Bridges, life hasn't exactly gone to plan. She is working in a dead end job, earning almost nothing and to top it all - she is thirty-two and still lives with her Dad. But all that could still change, couldn't it? So when work want to send her to the South of France to learn about the wine she is soon to be selling, it seems like a good idea. And it turns out Emmy is a fast learner. Far from home and unsure what she's doing, Emmy soon learns that life - like the local wine - is better when you trust your instincts. She may want to protect the vines from destruction but can Emmy also plant some roots of her own?

Late summer in the vineyard
Elle and Laurie are the last ones standing: they're single, they're not having babies any time soon and their weekends aren't filled with joyful meetings about mortgages. For Elle, this is fine. She likes her independent life, but Laurie wants love and she wants it now. So when Laurie begs Elle to come with her on a singles holiday to a beautiful vineyard in Tuscany, Elle is reluctant. She has no intention of swapping her perfectly lovely life for someone else's idea of her Mr Perfect, but 10 days under the Italian sun with her best friend and lashings of wine? How bad could that be? Full of sultry summer nights, hilarious moments and plenty of adventure, 'You Had Me at Merlot' will warm even the most cynical of hearts and have you believing in the magic of romance (and the power of a decent glass of wine).

Rural tourism and sustainable business
You find yourself in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany, where you’ve inherited a meager vineyard. You own a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, 3 workers…and the dream of owning the best winery in Italy. Your job is to allocate your workers and helpful visitors to complete various tasks throughout the year. Each season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There’s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to arrive at each one has an advantage over the rest. Using those workers and visitors, you can expand your vineyard by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders as you work towards the goal of owning the most successful winery in Tuscany.

A Good year : mainio vuosi
The objective of this thesis was to explore what has been implemented worldwide in wineries and hotels to further improve wine tourism activities and its attractiveness. The aim was to implement the case study and to obtain information on how to enhance operations in the field. The use of so called Web 2.0 sites as a marketing tool for wine tourism was also addressed in this research. The theoretical framework of the study is based literature on tourism, marketing in tourism, product development, and social media. The study was conducted by a qualitative research. The first step was to elaborate on a benchmarking study through 63 wineries all over the world, including Portugal, Spain, France, South Africa, the USA, and Argentina, to understand the new trends. Another data source was the analysis of the interviews done with Mr Ilkka Sirén, a social media and wine expert, and Mr Francisco Cabral from Quinta do Vallado. The analysis of the results indicates a clear tendency from the wineries to improve their facilities through an attractive architecture project which is also modern and technologically advanced. In terms of activities, the main focus is on art and innovative and unique experiences. Concerning the social media combined with the wine tourism, the study shows that this tool is and will be fundamental for brand establishing and awareness. The analysis of Quinta do Vallado shows that its strategy of building modern and technologically advanced facilities is putting it into the core of worldwide trends. However, there is still a need of improvement in terms of unique and innovative experiences and in the use of the social media, which despite being already settled is not yet being used at full power.
