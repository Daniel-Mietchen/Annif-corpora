Yhteenveto (Finnish summary)
Social work practice with adults has been undergoing a major change in recent years. The traditional divisions between health and social services have been gradually eroded, with the shift to the single assessment process and with social workers increasingly finding themselves employed within the health or independent sector. Therefore, knowing the full range of social work skills is vital and central to good practice with adult service users. This new guide will help students to understand these skills and includes chapters on intervention, empowerment and advocacy, skills for collaborative working, self-presentation and much more.
