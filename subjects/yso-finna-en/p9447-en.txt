This book introduces the fascinating world of plasmonics and physics at the nanoscale, with a focus on simulations and the theoretical aspects of optics and nanotechnology. A research field with numerous applications, plasmonics bridges the gap between the micrometer length scale of light and the secrets of the nanoworld. This is achieved by binding light to charge density oscillations of metallic nanostructures, so-called surface plasmons, which allow electromagnetic radiation to be focussed down to spots as small as a few nanometers. The book is a snapshot of recent and ongoing research and at the same time outlines our present understanding of the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles, ranging from the tunability of plasmonic resonances to the ultrafast dynamics of light-matter interaction. Beginning with a gentle introduction that highlights the basics of plasmonic interactions and plasmon imaging, the author then presents a suitable theoretical framework for the description of metallic nanostructures. This model based on this framework is first solved analytically for simple systems, and subsequently through numerical simulations for more general cases where, for example, surface roughness, nonlinear and nonlocal effects or metamaterials are investigated.--

Most existing books on wavelets are either too mathematical or they focus on too narrow a specialty. This book provides a thorough treatment of the subject from an engineering point of view. It is a one-stop source of theory, algorithms, applications, and computer codes related to wavelets. This second edition has been updated by the addition of: a section on "Other Wavelets" that describes curvelets, ridgelets, lifting wavelets, etc. a section on lifting algorithms Sections on Edge Detection and Geophysical Applications Section on Multiresolution Time Domain Method (MRTD) and on Inverse problems.

This book deals with the reflection of electromagnetic and particle waves by interfaces. The interfaces can be sharp or diffuse. The topics of the book contain absorption, inverse problems, anisotropy, pulses and finite beams, rough surfaces, matrix methods, numerical methods, reflection of particle waves and neutron reflection. Exact general results are presented, followed by long wave reflection, variational theory, reflection amplitude equations of the Riccati type, and reflection of short waves. There are new chapters on periodically stratified media, ellipsometry, chiral media, neutron reflection and reflection of acoustic waves. The chapter on anisotropy is much extended, with a complete treatment of the reflection and transmission properties of arbitrarily oriented uniaxial crystals.

Current literature on Nonlinear Optics varies widely in terms of content, style, and coverage of specific topics, relative emphasis of areas and the depth of treatment. While most of these books are excellent resources for the researchers, there is a strong need for books appropriate for presenting the subject at the undergraduate or postgraduate levels in Universities. The need for such a book to serve as a textbook at the level of the bachelors and masters courses was felt by the authors while teaching courses on nonlinear optics to students of both science and engineering during the past two decades. This book has emerged from an attempt to address the requirement of presenting the subject at college level. A one-semester course covering the essentials can effectively be designed based on this. - publisher's description

Geophysics is used in dealing with problems from academic to practical interest. Applications can include, an understanding the structure of the Earth, resource exploration, environmental and construction concerns, as well as archaeology, palaeontology, law enforcement, and counter-terrorism. The nature of this science make inaccessible to all but those with rigorous training in mathematics and physics. While there are a great many publications in geophysics at various levels, none has been directed towards those that have a professional need to know about the geophysical techniques or are simply curious. This book was written with that particular audience in mind. Although its fundamental focus is on archaeological applications, it is sufficiently broad to be useful as a reference to support other applications and is sufficiently self-contained to serve as an introductory text. With the numerous application of geophysics comes a multiplicity of geophysical techniques that support each application. This book addresses geophysical techniques that are most commonly employed in near-surface application; those used in probing the underground to a depth of about ten meters. Each technique is covered at multiple levels beginning with elementary discussions that call upon every-day intuitive insights, with subtleties explored in greater depth. For each method considered, there are a number of case studies that serve to illustrate, the range of applicability of the technique and how this type of data is interpreted. In addition, these case studies have been selected to be of popular interest. One aspect stressed in this book is that, for a given application, there is not necessarily a single geophysical technique that can completely characterize the Earth's shallow subsurface. The synergism of multiple geophysical methods is emphasized by the inclusion of an integrated case study that continues from chapter to chapter demonstrating the increased understanding associated with addition of information from each newly presented technique.
