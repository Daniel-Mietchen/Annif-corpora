Quantitative Thermochronology presents a range of numerical modeling techniques to allow the physical implications of isotopic age data to be explored. Various solutions to the heat transfer equation are illustrated by case studies across diverse tectonic settings and boundary conditions. Additional materials, including short tutorials, are available through the internet.
