Frommer's Yellowstone & Grand Teton national parks
Dad made me come to this snowy wilderness. My natural habitat is the shopping mall and the multi-screen cinema. I miss my friends and I'm not good at skiing or chopping wood ... or living without wi-fi. Mum, Dad, and Jem are all thriving here but I'm getting weaker and sicker with each day that passes. Then I find the bear. She's huge and scary, but she makes me feel ...alive ...and connected to this amazing place. The thing is, she needs me just as much as I need her. And I don't know if I'm strong enough. / WorldCat.
