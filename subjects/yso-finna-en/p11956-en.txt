In 1996, Pablo Ventura turned his attention to the choreography software Life Forms to find out whether the then-revolutionary new tool could lead to new possibilities of expression in contemporary dance. During the next 2 decades, he devised choreographic techniques and custom software to create dance works that highlight the operational logic of computers, accompanied by computer-generated dance and media elements. This article provides a firsthand account of how Ventura's engagement with algorithmic concepts guided and transformed his choreographic practice. The text describes the methods that were developed to create computer-aided dance choreographies. Furthermore, the text illustrates how choreography techniques can be applied to correlate formal and aesthetic aspects of movement, music, and video. Finally, the text emphasizes how Ventura's interest in the wider conceptual context has led him to explore with choreographic means fundamental issues concerning the characteristics of humans and machines and their increasingly profound interdependencies..

Creating art with mobile phones in public spaces is an emerging form of artistic expression. This dissertation investigates the design of mobile art applications for creating and sharing interactive art experiences in public spaces. It explores new ways of deploying mobile and ubiquitous computing for art making that fosters creativity and community. This is done by developing a series of novel prototype applications, with a focus on multimodal interfaces, that are put into use in authentic environments for validation by real people. The results of this research inform future design of new forms of artistic and social activity that may eventually become everyday actions of creative expression and exploration.

For matte painters and concept artists working in the movie, videogame, and TV industry, it can often be important to be able to quickly and efficiently create artwork, for storyboarding and storytelling purposes. Master the Art of Speed Painting: Digital Painting Techniques aims to be the go-to book for artists training to enter the industry, and for established artists looking to brush up on their knowledge of speed painting. Featuring helpful time-saving tips and techniques from established industry artists, such as how to create and use custom brushes, and how to implement an impressionistic style, there's plenty to offer to help the artist master their craft. In addition, there are time-specific guides for painting in 10-, 30-, 60- or 120-minute periods, all to enable the artist to tailor their abilities to suit any situation that might arise in the high-pressure, time-sensitive creative industry. Become a speed-painting master in no time! Master the Art of Speed Painting: Digital Painting Techniques also aims to fill a void within the digital art book market, as no directly comparative title currently exists. In today's fast-moving world, speed is often of the essence, and this book will become an essential guide for students and established artists alike.
