Hutterites
One of the longest-lived communal societies in North America, the Hutterites have developed complex communitarian perspectives on everything from conflict resolution and decision-making practices to standards of living and care for the elderly. This book offers a glimpse into the complex lives of nearly 500 North American Hutterite communities.
