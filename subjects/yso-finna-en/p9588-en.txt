This new title in the McGraw-Hill Second Language Professional Series contributes to the emerging new discipline of Translation Studies, and more specifically, to translation pedagogy. As such it connects theory and research to teaching practice through a pedagogical framework that serves as the foundation for teacher education and preparation. While it has as a goal the explanation of relevant theoretical and empirical research, its more encompassing objective is to serve as a handbook for the training of translation teachers. The result is a systematic methodology of translation teaching that replaces the anecdotal approaches that have been dominant in this field.

"Salman Rushdie's writing is engaged with translation in many ways: translator-figures tell and retell stories in his novels, while acts of translation are catalysts for climactic events. Covering his major novels as well as his often-neglected short stories and writing for children, Salman Rushdie and Translation explores the role of translation in Rushdie's work. In this book, Jenni Ramone draws on contemporary translation theory to analyse the part translation plays in Rushdie's appropriation of historical and contemporary Indian narratives of independence and migration."

This book uses the theoretical framework of information economics to analyze the translation profession. In particular, the economic concepts of asymmetric information and adverse selection are utilized. Due to the problem of asymmetric information, it is sometimes argued that when translation service buyers need to recruit new translators, they cannot effectively distinguish between a “good” translator and a “bad” one and hence tend to pay a price that is below the level when there is perfect and complete information. As a result, “good” translators may leave the translation profession. It is sometimes suggested that a translator certification system can act as an effective signal to differentiate between “good” translators and “bad” translators. A triangulation method is employed in this study to investigate the translator certification system and its signaling effects, using a number of research procedures (corpus analysis, questionnaire surveys, an experiment using fictitious résumés and interviews). This study should be valuable to those working in the translation profession as well as people who are interested in the complex and ever-changing global translation market.
