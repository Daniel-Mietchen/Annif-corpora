Tax harmonization or coordination of corporate taxation in the European Union is usually considered from two complementary points of view: tax base and tax rate. These two perspectives structure the debate on whether EU Member States, and more broadly states belonging to the same economic area, should harmonize or coordinate their policies on tax matters. However, little attention has been paid so far to a more basic question which is at the core of tax theory: who are corporate taxpayers? Are they defined in the same way throughout Europe? Comparative law shows that the conditions that must be met in order to be subject to corporate income tax are very different from one country to another. The way tax systems define foreign entities that fall under their corporate income tax may also vary significantly, which may in practice give rise to interesting tax planning opportunities. Against this background, the 2013 EATLP Congress devoted to corporate income tax subjects was designed to enhance the main similarities and differences that exist between many countries (European countries and the United States). It is the first time that such joint research has been conducted on an international scale on this fundamental topic and it has given rise to an ambitious publication. This book therefore provides a basis for tax policy decisions at a national and European level. It also constitutes a starting point for academic reflection on a core issue affecting the structure of corporate income taxation.

"How does EU law affect Member State corporate tax systems and the cross-border activities of companies? This unique study traces the historical development of EU corporate tax law and provides an in-depth analysis of a number of issues affecting companies, groups of companies and permanent establishments. Existing legislation, soft-law and the case-law of the Court of Justice are examined. The proposed CCCTB Directive and its potential application through enhanced co-operation are also considered. In addition to the tax issues pertaining to direct investment, the author examines the taxation of passive investment income, corporate reorganisations, exit taxes and the restrictive effect of domestic anti-abuse regimes. By doing so, the convergences and divergences arising from the interplay of EU corporate tax law and international tax law, especially the OECD model, are uncovered and highlighted"--

"The basic premise of this book is the existence of the EU regime for capital transactions - which also concerns direct taxation - consisting of both capital transactions regulation within the European Union and harmonized and non-harmonized regulation of direct taxation. The book develops the idea of such parallel existence of liberalization and direct taxation policies by exposing the current EU capital liberalization regime and its objectives and effects, as well as policy elements of the EU taxation regime. It compares and contrasts the building blocks of EU capital and taxation regimes with the OECD and the WTO regimes, in so far as possible. Moreover, the author draws upon her experience as a fourth râefâerendaire at the European Court of Justice to demonstrate how, on the subject of direct tax, the Court only interprets the EU fundamental freedoms and principles. Furthermore, the book tests how certain common features of the EU regulation of capital and taxation are applicable in terms of a future EU policy in the area of capital transactions and direct taxation, in particular within a CCCTB or a CCTB environment and in the context of the OECD BEPS project. The BEPS initiative is discussed in terms of its methodological value for the interpretation of the balance of taxation powers of Member States, as well as the premises of coordination, non-discrimination and abuse, the three interpretative pillars of future EU taxation policy defined in the book. The book concludes by proposing a methodological alternative to the Court's appreciation of tax matters, particularly from the perspective of EU fundamental freedoms and the entitlement to such freedoms."-- Back cover.
