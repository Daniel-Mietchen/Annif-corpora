"In typical child development, attention controls many aspects of learning, including memory, motor control, and problem solving. Attention organizes the constant influx of information that needs to be absorbed by children. Inside Visual Attention in Children: Theories and Activities, Dr. Kenneth A. Lane describes the positive aspects of attention that are needed for children to be successful in the classroom, such as concentration and vigilance, as opposed to negative aspects that can lead to failure, such as distractibility and confusion. This book is divided into two parts. The first eight chapters of the book explain attention and its relationship to vision and visual stimuli. The core topics discussed here include autism, AD/HD, dyslexia, executive function, and memory. The second half outlines a Vision Therapy program and consists of activities for improving visual attention in children. Over 100 activities are explained and illustrated. Visual Attention in Children: Theories and Activities is anchored on current theories in five areas of attention that shape child development. Theories Described Include: * Focused Attention - The ability to respond discreetly to visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli * Selective Attention - The ability to maintain behavioral or cognitive abilities in the face of distracting or competing stimuli * Shifting Attention - The ability to rapidly shift attention from one object to another * Sustained Attention - The ability to maintain a consistent behavioral response during a continuous or repetitive activity * Divided Attention -The ability to engage in more than one attention-focused task at one time" -- Provided by publisher.

This book provides a model for adapting best practices in cognitive-behavioral therapy to consumers whose language and cognitive deficits make it difficult for them to benefit from traditional talk oriented psychotherapy. The book focuses primarily upon the mental health care of those deaf clients, sometimes referred to as "low functioning" or "traditionally underserved," who are particularly difficult to engage in meaningful treatment. Drawing most heavily upon the work of Donald Meichenbaum, Marsha Linehan and Ross Greene, this book presents adaptations and simplifications of psychotherapy which make it accessible and meaningful for persons often viewed as "poor candidates." The heart of the book is a greatly simplified approach to psychosocial skill training, especially in the domains of coping, conflict resolution and relapse prevention skills, as well as an extensive discussion of "pre-treatment" strategies for engaging clients in mental health care. Also included is research demonstrating how deaf mental health clients are different than hearing clients, guidelines for doing mental status examinations with deaf clients whose language dysfluency gives them the false appearance of having thought disorders, and a chapter on developing staff and creating culturally and clinically appropriate treatment programs. Included with the book is a CD-ROM containing over 1500 beautifully drawn illustrations of a wide range of mental health and substance abuse related concepts. These pictures or "skill cards" are used in psychoeducation and therapy with persons who can not read English.

Music has always been an essential part of what it is to be human and yet not everyone has access to the music-based opportunities others take for granted. Motivated by the belief that individuals are disabled by society rather than any impairment they might have, Jane Williams sets out to show how someone with learning difficulties can engage with music in as many diverse and fulfilling ways as the rest of their community and generation. This practical guide will equip you with everything you need to know to help empower people with learning difficulties to experience and enjoy music, meaningfully. It sets out activity ideas in the context of existing Occupational Therapy models and offers a host of tips, resources and ready-to-use themed lesson plans to inspire and enrich your practice. There are also many practical examples and real-life success stories that show how to put the theory into practice, including downloadable tracks composed and performed by The LA Buskers, a band Jane works with. Accessible, practical and inspirational, the unique approaches described in this book will be of immeasurable interest to occupational therapists, social care workers responsible for planning and delivering activity programmes as well as community musicians.
