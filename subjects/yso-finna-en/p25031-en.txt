"The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance"--

Measuring performance in a way which is linked to strategy and measures the right activities is a process which few organizations undertake, but those which do reap substantial benefits in terms of increased success. Even fewer organizations can maintain and use their measurement system effectively, engaging the workforce in delivering success. This book will show readers how to do just that, using relevant examples from a variety of organizations including: Tesco's 'steering wheel'- a means of displaying what is important to the organization from boardroom to store - Terry Leahy has attributed much of Tesco's success to their performance management approach EDF Energy's highly innovative approach to cascading their 'success maps' down the organization, winning them a high degree of ownership and commitment to the organizational goals by involving people at all levels in the process Taking a practical approach, and including details of processes and tools that can be adopted and customized by any organization, the authors also include guiding principles to help readers avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate performance management. The book, uniquely, combines guidance on the practical use of frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, with the application of measures to manage performance"--
