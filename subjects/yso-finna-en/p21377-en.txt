"Identities in Context is a comprehensive guide to contemporary discursive research on issues relating to identity across a variety of contexts. By relying on an examination of discourse as a focus of study in its own right, a clearer understanding of the relationships between the sense of ourselves and our interactions with others in various social situations is gained. This approach also reveals how discursive research has, over time, contributed to a greater understanding of a variety of topics relating to identity addressed by specific research. For instance, we are shown the consequences associated with identity in interactions within the legal system, as well as on treatment and intervention of individuals in health care settings. Identities in Context provides an accessible, detailed, and enlightening examination of our current state of knowledge on all issues relating to identities and discursive research"--
