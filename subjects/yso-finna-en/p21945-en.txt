"An important goal of the extended use of biomass is replacing fossil fuels. Potentially, all global energy needs can be covered with biomass if the utilization is efficient enough. This book provides the state of the art in the field of efficient conversion of biomass, covering most technical issues such as combustion, gasification, torrefaction, pyrolysis, pelletizing and biogasproduction. The book combines a thorough description of interesting new technologies and the basic principles and tools to be used in future process optimization work. The wide coverage of examples from all over the world will make the book important as a text book on the subject"--

Potential of commercial scale biogas production from organic waste in Nepal
"Description Interest in anaerobic digestion (AD), the process of energy production through the production of biogas, has increased rapidly in recent years. Agricultural and other organic waste are important substrates which can be treated by AD. This book is one of the first to provide a broad introduction to anaerobic digestion and its potential to turn agricultural crops or crop residues, animal and other organic waste, into biomethane. The substrates used can include any non-woody materials, including grass and maize silage, seaweeds, farm slurry, municipal and industrial wastes. These are all systematically reviewed in terms of their suitability from a biological, technical and economic perspective. In the past the technical competence and high capital investment required for industrial-scale anaerobic digesters has limited their uptake, but the authors show that recent advances have made smaller-scale systems more viable through a greater understanding of optimising bacterial metabolism and productivity. Broader issues such as life cycle assessment and energy policies to promote AD are also discussed"--

The disposal of municipal solid waste (MWS) is a  growing problem worldwide because of the increasing  volume of the waste and the negative impact on the  environment, health and safety. Among the combustion  and incineration technologies, fluidized  bed combustion is becoming more popular because of  its ability to handle a variety of waste and  advantages in controlling emission. However,in  the high moisture content wastes with low  calorific value, co-firing wastes with a  supplementary fuel such as coal is being tried in  many industrial and utility boilers. In order to  ensure that these co-firing facilities are properly  designed and operated, a fundamental understanding  of the co-combustion phenomena including its  dynamical characteristics must be established. It  is for this reason a basic study on the co-  combustion of MSW and lignite in a fluidized bed is  proposed. The objectives of this book are to  investigate the effect of main operating parameters  on combustion characteristics, to quantify the  fluctuating characteristics during steady-state  operation using statistical analysis and to create  a linear model obtained from input-output analysis. / Kustantajan esittely.
