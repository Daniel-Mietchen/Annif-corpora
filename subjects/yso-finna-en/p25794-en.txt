Christopher Columbus and his lesser known rival, fellow Italian explorer for hire John Cabot, were both searching for a shortcut to the riches of the Indies, instead they found a New World they were not looking for. This revelatory look at how their lives intersected provides a fresh insight into a turning point in world history.
