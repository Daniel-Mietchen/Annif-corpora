Watershed modeling is at the heart of modern hydrology, supplying rich information that is vital to addressing resource planning, environmental, and social problems. Even in light of this important role, many books relegate the subject to a single chapter while books devoted to modeling focus only on a specific area of application. Recognizing the need for a broad, comprehensive overview of the various types of watershed models, renowned experts Singh and Frevert carefully selected several highly popular and useful models to produce this groundbreaking reference. Watershed Models comprises seven sections that encompass 24 models chosen for a variety of characteristics, such as physical bases, mathematical sophistication, comprehensiveness, broad-based applicability, and use of modern tools. After a concise introduction, the book examines the history and evolution of watershed modeling derived from the Stanford Watershed Model along with regional calibration of models. The following six sections explore large watershed, streamflow, water quality, urban watershed, agricultural watershed, and planning and management models. Each chapter contains a wealth of information on model parameters, the strengths of each model for particular purposes, and examples of applications. Offering an up-to-date review of models used worldwide, Watershed Models supplies broad, integrated knowledge necessary for solving the complex and ongoing problems involved in resource and environmental water management.
