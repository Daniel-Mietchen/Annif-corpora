"A thorough and comprehensive guide to measuring and managing the performance of businesses, understanding where you are, communicating where you want to be and managing towards your longer term strategic goals. Measuring performance in a way which is linked to strategy and measures the right activities is a process which few organizations undertake, but those which do reap substantial benefits in terms of increased success. Even fewer organizations can maintain and use their measurement system effectively, engaging the workforce in delivering success. This book will show readers how to do just that, using relevant examples from a variety of organizations including: Tesco's 'steering wheel'- a means of displaying what is important to the organization from boardroom to store - Terry Leahy has attributed much of Tesco's success to their performance management approach EDF Energy's highly innovative approach to cascading their 'success maps' down the organization, winning them a high degree of ownership and commitment to the organizational goals by involving people at all levels in the process Taking a practical approach, and including details of processes and tools that can be adopted and customized by any organization, the authors also include guiding principles to help readers avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate performance management. The book, uniquely, combines guidance on the practical use of frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, with the application of measures to manage performance"--

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to develop supplier performance for Cimcorp. The  study aimed at answering to the following question: “How to develop supplier performance  in Cimcorp?” The development work was done in co-operation with suppliers  by developing their contribution for the delivery of purchased goods and services.  Supplier development methods and tools are used in many organizations to assist  suppliers in improving supply chain performance and providing a major source of  competitive advantage. In Cimcorp the increased competitive pressure at the global  markets forms a driver for continuous improvement.  Qualitative action research was a study method combining the survey, interviews and  observations that all were implemented in the study. The survey for Cimcorp's key  suppliers and interviews for internal customers of the procurement organization were  implemented to analyze the development need of the suppliers' performance during  purchase order-delivery process. The survey and interview results were used to find  the right monitoring tools and practical improvement procedures for developing suppliers'  performance during different phases of purchasing order-delivery process.  The results of the survey for Cimcorp's key suppliers and interviews for the internal  customer indicate that Cimcorp's purchase order-delivery process works mostly well.  The most essential finding was that 60 % of the suppliers do not have their own KPIs  for measuring on-time deliveries and reclaims. That increases the need for monitoring  and informing about suppliers' on-time deliveries and reclaims by Cimcorp.  Sharing performance rates with suppliers is a crucial task benefitting the delivery reliability  of both counterparts. In the addition more active informing about the delivery  times, more focus on the economical transportation and packing methods, new  reports for controlling on-time deliveries and reclaims were suggested as well as taking  a new KPI, cost savings in use.
