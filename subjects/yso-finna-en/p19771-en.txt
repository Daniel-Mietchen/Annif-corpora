Can Christian belief in God, a contemporary scientific approach to human life, and human experience all be held together? Yes, says Jan-Olav Henriksen, who in this book shows how such a synthesis can be realized.Taking both knowledge of evolution and belief in God as Creator into account, Henriksen's Life, Love, and Hope articulates a vision for understanding the relationship between God and human experience in contemporary terms. Henriksen maintains that evolutionary theory does not account for all that can and must be said about human life and experience. Conversely, he also argues that any belief in God as Creator can be informed and deepened by knowledge of evolution.This thoughtful, nuanced book develops a comprehensive vision that will appeal to anyone who ponders the relationship between God and science. -- Review: Niels Henrik Gregersen-- University of Copenhagen In this major work Henriksen shows how life-orienting experiences of God relate to the big cosmic canvas as well as to the small things of life. He engages science and theology in a sense-making way that is remarkably wide-ranging and up-to-date. "

The first comprehensive, psychological theory in over a century - Reiss picks up where William James left off. This ground breaking work will change the way we understand religion. Religion is about the values motivated by the sixteen basic desires of human nature. It has mass appeal because it accommodates the values of people with opposite personality traits. This is the first comprehensive theory of the psychology of religion that can be scientifically verified.

The psychology of religion
While adjusting to a new identity is akin to adjusting to a new set of skin, even more difficult is realising that this new skin may not be as comfortable or as pleasant as the old one. In Searching for Heaven in the Real World, Kathryn Kraft explores the breadth of psychological and societal issues faced by Arab Muslims after making a decision to adopt a faith in Christ or Christianity, investigating some of the most surprising and significant challenges new believers face. Arab Muslims arrive at a point of new faith with great expectations. With such high hopes for what they will experience in their new identity, they are bound to encounter a reality that is different. They need to invest a great deal of emotional energy in addressing their expectations and what they actually encounter. Even so, those who stay the course of faith usually hold on to their dreams, believing that heaven is not only for the afterlife but it is for the real world as well.

"Care for other human beings is at the heart of ministry and brings ministers in contact with wholeof human life. The focus of this handbook of psychology for pastoral contexts is on psychological insight into human relationships and mental health. It can be read as a whole, or used as a handbook for reference to particular problems. At the same time it attempts to put psychological concepts into everyday language. Jessica Osborne, an experienced psychologist and teacher, discusses areas such as attachment, dependency and anxiety, betrayal and reconciliation, mental health issues, such as depression, eating disorders and addiction, stress, violence and abuse and suffering. The book will be useful on pastoral care courses at all levels and suitable for practitioners and people in training for pastoral ministry - lay or ordained." --Publisher's description.

"Insanity and Sanctity in Byzantium aims to understand how the use of psychological abnormality functions in deep societal transformations, producing a major shift in the religious, cultural, mental, and social aspects. The book examines a particular set of religious phenomena, in a broadly defined period and area - the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East between the birth of Christianity and that of Islam - and seeks to reach conclusions on the nature and function of abnormal behavior sanctified by society. Taking as a starting point a particular type of saint of Orthodox Christianity, the holy fool, the person who feigns madness, and investigating other types of saints who portray abnormal behavior, such as the martyr and the ascetic, the book reveals the ambiguous character of the boundary between sanity and insanity. It explains the significance of this ambiguity to the religious experience as a motor of social movement, and sets it at the core of the socio-religious transformation that changed the Antique civilization into a world of medieval societies."--

"What is a religious or spiritual delusion? What does religious delusion reveal about the difference between good and bad spirituality? What is the connection between religious delusion and moral failure? Or between religious delusion and religious terrorism? Or religious delusion and despair? The Abraham Dilemma: A Divine Delusion is the first book written by a philosopher on the topic of religious delusion -- on the disorder's causes, contents, consequences, diagnosis and treatment. The book argues that we cannot understand a religious delusion without appreciating three facts. One is that religiosity or spirituality is a part of human nature, whether it takes theistic or non-theistic forms. Another is that religious delusion is something to which we are all vulnerable. The third is that the delusion is not best understood by reducing it to brain chemistry, or by insisting that it is empirically false. It is best understood by examining its harmful personal and moral consequences -- consequences that nearly unfolded when the biblical patriarch Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac in response to a command, he thought, from God. The book presents a fascinating and profound exploration of a phenomenon as old as mankind itself."--

Religion has always been a major study in psychology, but recent events, including terrorism, have sharpened attention on the relationship between personality and religion. This collection concentrates on reproducible results and logic, rather than unproved theories and instant reactions. Contributors of these fifteen essays review the accumulated research and theories on the major aspects of personality and social psychology as applied to religion. They concentrate on personality, cognition, and emotion (personality and religiousness, religion and the self, religious cognition, religion and negative emotions as they relate to regulation, positive emotions and self-transcendence), social behavior, morality, and intergroup relations (personal and cognitive factors as they relate to social factors, religion and prejudice in intergroup relations, values as religiosity, religion and sexuality within family, religion and domestic political attitudes around the world, social aspects of religion and mental health), and age, gender and culture (religion and development, gender difference in religion, religion and the national culture, understanding religion and irreligion).

The spiritual nature of man : a study of contemporary religious experience
Modern scholarship in several disciplines makes it clear that the Bible and the Quran were authored by humans. Nevertheless fundamentalists persist in believing in the divine authorship of their sacred scriptures. In this book, Solomon Schimmel seeks to understand why these people insist on such beliefs and how they defend them.

Spirituality, Theology and Mental Health provides reflections from leading international scholars and practitioners in theology, anthropology, philosophy and psychiatry as to the nature of spirituality and its relevance to constructions of mental disorder and mental healthcare. Key issues are explored in depth, including the nature of spirituality and recent debates concerning its importance in contemporary psychiatric practice, relationship between demons and wellbeing in ancient religious texts and contemporary practice, religious conversion, and the nature and importance of myth and theology in shaping human self understanding. These are used as a basis for exploring some of the overarching intellectual and practical issues that arise when different disciplines engage together with an attempt to better understand the relationship between spirituality and mental health and translate their findings into mental healthcare practice.
