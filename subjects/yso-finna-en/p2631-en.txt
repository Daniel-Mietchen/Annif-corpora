Microbiologists Brett Finlay and Marie-Claire Arrieta explain how the trillions of microbes that live in and on our bodies influence childhood development; why an imbalance of those microbes can lead to obesity, diabetes, and asthma, among other chronic conditions; and what parents can do -- from conception on -- to positively affect their own behaviors and those of their children. They describe how natural childbirth, breastfeeding, and solid foods influence children’s microbiota. They also offer practical advice on matters such as whether to sterilize food implements for babies, the use of antibiotics, the safety of vaccines, and why having pets is a good idea.

"This third edition of Introductory Maternity and Pediatric Nursing reflects the underlying philosophy of love, caring, and support for the childbearing woman, the child, and the families of these individuals. The content has been developed according to the most current information available. In this text, we recognize that cultural sensitivity and awareness are important aspects of caring for the childbearing and child-rearing families. We also recognize that many children and pregnant women live in families other than traditional two-parent family homes and therefore refer to teaching and supporting the childbearing clients and family caregivers of children in all situations and family structures"--Provided by publisher.
