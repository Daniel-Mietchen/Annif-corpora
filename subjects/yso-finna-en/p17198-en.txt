Over the last few decades, biopharmaceuticals have transformed many areas of healthcare and have given hope and extended the lives of many patients. Curative treatments, however, remain elusive in most cases. This book describes strategies to develop improved versions of biopharmaceuticals (“biobetters”) to bridge the gap between existing therapies and curative therapies. With an aim to stimulate research and development in a wide array of therapeutic areas, diverse topics are covered, including the following: tissue specific targeting of enzyme replacement therapies; the development of novel protein structures with the potential to improve upon critical attributes of current monoclonal antibodies; the modification of current monoclonal antibody designs to improve their in vivo stability; and finally, the economic and regulatory considerations for the development of biobetters

"This is the first book entirely devoted to the design and analysis for assessment of biosimilarity and drug interchangeability of biosimilars, and test for comparability in manufacturing processes of biologic products. It covers all of the statistical issues that may occur in biosimilar studies under various study designs at various stages of research and development of biologic products"--
Characterisation of ECV304 cell line with focus on transport protein expression : comparison to other established cell lines
The purpose of the case study was to evaluate the expansion of contract manufacturing capacities at Biovian Ltd, a biopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing company. Starting point for the study was the fact that Biovian received an initiative for expansion from one of the clients to manufacture continuously a biopharmaceutical product for sales. The aim was to estimate the required size of investment as well as to make predictions about the payback period of the investment. Pre-requisites for the manufacturing capacity expansion were identified. A project plan and schedule was drawn up. Plans were laid out for expansion of the manufacturing plant, equipment acquisitions and personnel resources. Technology transfer of the production method was included in the planning. The plans were used to estimate capital expenditures required for the investment. Additionally, the fixed costs were forecasted.This in turn helped to predict the payback period and to justify pricing. The business model of continuous manufacturing is different from Biovian's current business model for contract development and manufacturing. The differences between the two business models were studied and compared. The purpose of the comparisons was to provide company management with new viewpoints for investment decisions. Finally, in the concluding part, the case study findings and observations were reflected on in light of literature on the biopharmaceutical industry. The growing biopharmaceutical market, current shortage of contract manufacturing capacity, and the outsourcing market trend all support investments into manufacturing capacity. The client's commitment to a long-term contract was perceived as the greatest risk for the investment decision.In order to ensure the client's commitment and to distribute the capital risks equally, an initiative for new strategic partnership between the company and the client was suggested. The results in this case study were used by the company in preparing for and conducting contract negotiations.
Computer-assisted separation and primary screening of bioactive compounds
"Biologic drug products are therapeutic moieties that are manufactured using a living system or organism. These are important life-saving drug products for patients with unmet medical needs. They also comprise a growing segment in the pharmaceutical industry. In 2007, for instance, worldwide sales of biological products reached $94 billion US dollars, accounting for about 15% of the pharmaceutical industry's gross revenue. Meanwhile, many biological products face losing their patents in the next decade"--
