Assessment of skin physiology is moving rapidly away from a purely descriptive approach as we gain a deeper understanding of biophysical and biochemical processes in the stratum corneum, such as those relating to its barrier function and hydration. As a result of research utilizing bioengineering methods, reliable and reproducible approaches are now available for product testing in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as well as in basic research. This book examines in detail all aspects of cosmetic testing -- legal, general, and practical. After discussion of regulatory and ethical issues and guidelines, essential guidance is provided on the planning, performance, and evaluation of scientific studies in skin physiology. The topics addressed range from laboratory and staffing requirements through to testing devices and methods, factors influencing measurements, and study design. In addition, detailed information is provided on test settings for a range of cosmetic products. All of the authors are recognized experts in their field. This book will be invaluable to researchers, students, and medical staff in explaining how best to assess skin functions in controlled studies using non-invasive biophysical instruments.

Today, young cosmetics researchers who have completed their graduate studies and have entered a cosmetics company are put through several years of training before they become qualified to design cosmetics formulations themselves. They are trained so that they can design formulas not by a process of logic but by heart, like craftsmen, chefs, or carpenters. This kind of training seems a terrible waste of labor and time. To address this issue and allow young scientists to design novel cosmetics formulations, effectively bringing greater diversity of innovation to the industry, this book provides

International Marketing Strategy for Herborist
This study examines the buying behaviour of Finnish women related to facial skin care products. The primary purpose of the study is to discover the similarities and differences in the buying behaviour of young and middle-aged women when purchasing facial skin care products. The objective is to study what kinds of factors affect the buying behaviour of both young (20 to 35 years old) and middle-aged (40 to 60 years old) women and then compare the findings from both groups. Furthermore, the aim is to discover what kind of attitudes Finnish women have towards facial skin care products containing natural ingredients. The objective is to also study the extent to which the using of natural ingredients in facial skin care products affects the buying behaviour of Finnish women. The theoretical framework of this study was based on consumer behaviour theories from various authors. For example according to Kotler and Keller (2009) cultural, social and personal factors affect consumer behaviour and these issues were discussed in the literature review. Theoretical information related to the scope of this thesis was also presented by Solomon, Bamossy, Askegaard and Hogg (2006) as well as Noel (2009) among others. The study was conducted by using quantitative research method. Data was collected through conducting an email survey compiled with Webropol. The questionnaire was sent to 505 women who had joined the cosmetics company Lumene's client club last spring while taking part in a competition. All together, 138 women who fit the two age categories studied in this thesis answered the research questionnaire. The results indicated that 20-35 and 40-60 year-old Finnish women were rather similar in terms of the factors affecting their buying behaviour related to facial skin care products. However, some differences were also found for example in the decision-making process. Regarding the attitudes toward the use of natural ingredients in facial skin care products, differences were found between different demographic groups. For example, women who had children were more favourable toward the use of natural ingredients than women who did not have children. In sum, the objectives of this thesis were met well. Although existing literature suggests that factors such as age have an impact on buying behaviour, the results showed that it does not have that big of an impact on the purchasing behaviour of Finnish women related to facial skin care products. However, the research findings of this study can definitely benefit the case company Lumene in their business actions.
