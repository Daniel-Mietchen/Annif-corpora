Aspects of social control in welfare states
"Communities are intertwined with social control, and sometimes with religion and apparently there is no permanent human group in which we could't find the functioning of social control. Social control, as to make a generalization, is oriented to realizing the possibility of coexistence of people, in other words - to prevent a war of all against all. From the thesis, drawn according by interdisciplinary research principles, follow that religion and social control theory used by criminology has at least one interface, it is deviance identification and prevention. The thesis pays much attention on establishing the fact whether religion has an unlawful behavior inhibiting ability or not. Materials examined in this dissertation give the base to state that religion can act as a barrier to unlawful conduct. But why it has such an influence, and by what routes does it influence, it is not possible to say using contemporary knowledge. In the thesis a number of opportunities are noticed and it isn't ruled out that religion has a complex influence principle or concurrence that influences every person in different ways. However, I accept that despite all ways by what religion can affect individual behavior, the most universal way is the existence of a moral community, which can affect even those individuals who have identified themselves as non-religious. The role of religion and its effectiveness in social control sphere in the near future can not be precisely predicted, but according to the prevailing approach to religion in different societies it can be expected, that at least based on the historical tradition the influence of religion will last in the process of social control. In secular countries such as Estonia, there is probably no reason to hope that religion and religiosity would be a significant aid to fight against crime or deviance in general. For that effect religion in secular states has too little influence and constituency."

With regard to urban footpaths, there are two actors with different interests, the municipal authorities who, in theory, pursue town planning and maintain footpaths for the convenience of pedestrians, and the poor homeless living illegally on footpaths with the constant fear of being forced to leave. There exists a clear difference in stand-point between authorities and pavement dwellers on the use of footpaths: the former has a power to keep the public space free from encroachment but the latter finds the footpaths a space advantageous for living. The discussion focuses on pavement shrines that have become more ubiquitous in Chennai city, South India, since the 1990s and are mostly huilt and maintained by the socially and economically weaker sections of the city population. Footpath shrines may have and represent a power of resistance against authorities in the name of the sacred places they have been erected on, and are thus a weapon of the weak in their tactics for survival in the city. This ethnigraphic example holds an important theoretical connotation in terms of the emergence of a dynamic concept of sacred by suggesting that the edge or boudary of the dominant ideological social space or the boudary between the legal and the illegal in its context embraces a potentiality of producing sacrality, as is suggested by Veikko Anttonen's rethinking of the notion of sacred from the viewpoint of cognitive categorization.
