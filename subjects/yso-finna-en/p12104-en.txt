A combination of reference book and tutorial, Writing to Clients elucidates the qualities that create a writer's unique presence on the page with illustrations of correct English grammar, and is appropriate for graduate psychology students and for practicing professionals. In addition to style and grammar, the author details how to write less formal reports in letter form and to write a therapeutic story as an extension of the report for child, teenager, or adult".

Intellectual capital is one of the most important assets of any company and its importance is emphasizes in knowledge intensive organisations. In these organisations, it is essential that the employees are motivated and committed to develop their professional skills, continuously learn and to improve their performance. This thesis examines the motivational effect of a pre described career path model in an IT service company. The goal is to further develop the career path model and to examine how well the employees feel the model responds to its purpose of increasing motivation and commitment in the organisation and guiding people in their individual career decisions. In the theory part of this thesis careers and career development are discussed along with theories on motivation. A section on knowledge intensive organisation is included in the theory part, to understand the specific nature of the case company. The theory is based on a literature review, and the aim is at setting a theoretical framework for the study, that can be used in the empirical part. The empirical part of the thesis was conducted as a survey using questionnaires. The results were analysed using both, quantitative and qualitative approaches. The survey was conducted during one week, from November 11th to November 21st of 2008, as in Internet based form, and a link to the form was submitted to the respondents via email. The results of the survey indicate that the employees of the case company are well motivated in their work, very motivated to further develop their professional skills and that they feel committed to their organisation. The career path models under study in this thesis were well received and no clear criticism towards them arose. At the moment the models are very new, so practical experience of the long term effects of the models' implementation does not exist. At the moment it seems, that the models correspond very well to their task of communicating organisational development needs, increasing commitment and increasing the employees' motivation to further develop their professional skills.

"In this book, an array of legal, biomedical, psychosocial, and social science scholars and practitioners offer the first comparative account of the increasing dependence on expertise in the asylum and refugee status determination process. This volume presents a comprehensive study of the relevance of experts, as mediators of culture, who are called upon to corroborate, substantiate credibility, and serve as translators in the face of confusing legal standards that require proof of new forms and reasons for persecution around the globe. The authors draw upon their interactions with expertise and the immigration process to provide insights into the evidentiary burdens on asylum seekers and the expanding role of expertise in the forms of country-conditions reports, biomedical and psychiatric evaluations, and the emerging field of forensic linguistic analysis in response to emerging forms of persecution, such as gender-based or sexuality-based persecution. This book is essential reading for both scholars interested in the production of knowledge and clinicians considering the role of experts as mediators of asylum claims"--
