Regional Electricity Market Design
"Details the often incomplete, incoherent, and ineffectual U.S. energy policy, tackling specific policy questions: Why are these components of energy policy so important? How would 'acting in time'--not waiting until politics demands action--make a difference? What should our policy actually be? Proposes measures to overcome this counterproductive tendency"--Provided by publisher.

Electricity market reform is currently an ongoing process in Russia, promoting competitive wholesale and retail sectors.The overall goal of the reform is to attract investments and to improve the efficiency of the Russian electricity industry.The growing economy is consuming more and more electricity and the old capacity is deteriorating.There have been electricity shortages already and more severe ones are forecasted to occur this winter.Russia needs to speed up the reform and continue the stable development of its economy in order to attract investments to the sector.This could improve the situation in the medium term, but in the short term significant progress can be achieved by improving the efficiency of the electricity sector.

Do current electricity market designs ensure a sufficient electricity supply at all times? This topic is currently the subject of intense debate across Europe, and several major countries such as Germany, the UK, France and Italy have decided that additional measures - so-called capacity remuneration mechanisms - are needed to supplement current market designs. This report describes and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of a range of measures proposed or currently implemented across Europe, and includes both best estimates of how the implementation of these measures will impact Nordic electricity prices as well as recommendations to the Nordic countries regarding a cost-efficient path to ensuring the Nordic security of supply.
