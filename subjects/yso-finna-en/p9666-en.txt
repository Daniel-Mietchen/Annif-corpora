dynasties
This book is about one of the most powerful and influential dynasties in English history, a dynasty of five monarchs who ruled their domain for over a century. The Tudors were concerned with building a government that would endure, hence their constant concern with succession, an anxiety which lasted throughout the century. Although all Tudor monarchs believed that their authority derived from God, they had different ways of expressing that conviction, and above all they believed in ruling with consent and advice. For this reason they built partnerships, not with the old nobility as their predecessors had done, but with the wider community of the gentry, and above all with parliament. These partnerships with the church and state lasted for centuries and still influence British politics today.

The Medici
The Achaemenid Persian Empire, at its greatest territorial extent under Darius I (r. 522486 BCE), held sway over territory stretching from the Indus River Valley to southeastern Europe and from the western Himalayas to northeast Africa. In this book, Matt Waters gives a detailed historical overview of the Achaemenid period while considering the manifold interpretive problems historians face in constructing and understanding its history. This book offers a Persian perspective even when relying on Greek textual sources and archaeological evidence. Waters situates the story of the Achaemenid Persians in the context of their predecessors in the mid-first millennium BCE and through their successors after the Macedonian conquest, constructing a compelling narrative of how the empire retained its vitality for more than two hundred years (c. 550330 BCE) and left a massive imprint on Middle Eastern as well as Greek and European history.

This book investigates the origin and the character of Early Chinese Christianity (Œi<³Jingjiao) during the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). It sets Tang Christianity against the background of Syriac Christianity and the Tang cultural milieu, and then particularly focuses on the Tang Christian Monument and two Dunhuang manuscripts, the Hymn to the Trinity and Saints and Scriptures, providing syntactical analyses and fresh translations of the primary material. The research integrates western and Chinese scholarship on the subject and also provides an assessment of the history and theology of Tang Christianity. The book argues that Tang Christianity should not be branded with the Nestorian label, but must be understood in its own right.
Presents the political history of China from the fall of the T'ang Dynasty in 907 to the Mongol conquest of the Southern Sung in 1279. Surveys the personalities and events that marked the rise, consolidation, and demise of the Sung polity during an era of profound social, economic, and intellectual ferment. Places particular emphasis on the emergence of a politically conscious literati class during the Sung, characterized by the increasing importance of the examination system early in the dynasty and on the rise of the tao-hsueh (Neo-Confucian) movement toward the end. Highlights the destabilizing influence of factionalism and ministerial despotism on Sung political culture and the impact of the powerful steppe empires of the Khitan Liao, Tangut Hsi Hsia, Jurchen Chin, and Mongol Yüan on the shape and tempo of Sung dynastic events.

The Ptolemies, the sea and the Nile : studies in waterborne power
With its emphasis on the dynasty's concern for control of the sea--both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea--and the Nile, this book offers a new and original perspective on Ptolemaic power in a key period of Hellenistic history. Within the developing Aegean empire of the Ptolemies, the role of the navy is examined together with that of its admirals. Egypt's close relationship to Rhodes is subjected to scrutiny, as is the constant threat of piracy to the transport of goods on the Nile and by sea. Along with the trade in grain came the exchange of other products. Ptolemaic kings used their wealth for luxury ships and the dissemination of royal portraiture was accompanied by royal cult. Alexandria, the new capital of Egypt, attracted poets, scholars and even philosophers; geographical exploration by sea was a feature of the period and observations of the time enjoyed a long afterlife.

Feathered serpent : a novel
A history of ancient Egypt
Under Seljuk rule (c. 1081-1308) the formerly Christian Byzantine territories of Anatolia were transformed by the development of Muslim culture, society and politics, and it was then - well before the arrival of the Ottomans - that a Turkish population became firmly established in these lands. But these developments are little understood, and the Seljuk dynasty remains little studied. Yet the Seljuks of Anatolia were one of the most influential dynasties of the thirteenth-century Middle East, controlling some of the major trade routes of the period, playing a crucial role in linking East and West of the medieval world. This volume examines Seljuk culture and history by looking at developments both at court and in society at large and shed new light on Seljuk political culture and dynastic ideology, the engagement of politics with religion, and Christian-Muslim interaction. The Seljuks of Anatolia will be of great interest to researchers with interests in Byzantium as well as the material culture and society of the medieval Islamic world.
"Haiti" is the definitive account of the ruling Duvalier family and its legacy. In 1803, the enslaved people of Haiti vanquished their French masters after a bloody war which left thousands dead. In 1986, Haitians celebrated another victory, as Baby Doc Duvalier fled to France, ending three decades of brutal dictatorship. The Duvalier regime slaughtered at least 50,000 people, many in the infamous Fort Dimanche. Duvalierism drove a million people into exile, cowed the six million that remained and was responsible for the torture of hundreds of thousands. Their oppression shaped modern Haiti as Elizabeth Abbott demonstrates as she traces the repercussions of their actions to the present day, including the earthquake which moved the world.

"It has been said that the twenty-first century will be China's century. Such a remark highlights the importance of being informed about China's long and tumultuous history. J.A.G. Roberts traces the main course of that history, from the earliest times, through the centuries of imperial government, to the present day. Chapters on China's imperial history identify the main political and economic changes, whilst introducting key social themes. Turning to the modern period, Roberts then traces the dramatic evenuts of the Opium Wars, the 1911 Revolution and the Republican era. The book ends with a detailed discussion of China under Communist rule and a wide-ranging review of new developments, including China's economic achievements and its costs. Thoroughly revised and expanded in the light of the latest research, and now featuring a helpful chronology, this up-to-date, authoritative overview of China's past is ideal for students and general readers alike"--
