Abstract: The equations to determine the height of the c.g. (center of gravity) of a sprung vehicle, considering all of the vehicle compliances were formulated. They were then compared to the classic rigid vehicle equations. It was determined that the error on the c.g. height could not be obtained using this comparison. The errors due to instrumentation accuracies were investigated. The results indicate that the error of the c.g. height could be as high as 20-50%. Based on the sprung vehicle equations, methods are given whereby the error on the c.g. height can be significantly reduced to 2-3%.
