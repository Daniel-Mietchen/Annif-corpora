Mélanges : processes of formation and societal significance
In this edition, most of the commonly occurring minerals of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are discussed in terms of structure, chemistry, optical and other physical properties, distinguishing features and paragenesis. Important correlations between these aspects of mineralogy are emphasized wherever possible. The content of each section has been updated where needed in the light of published research over the 21 years between editions. Tables of over 200 chemical analyses and formulae are included and a number of older entries have been replaced by more recent examples. Major new features: Entirely new views of crystal structures in perspective using CrystalMaker colour images; CrystalViewer interactive CD with >100 mineral structures included; Over 60 colour photographs of minerals in thin sections of rocks under the petrological microscope; Considerably expanded treatment of feldspar and zeolite minerals; Mineral identification table based on birefringence and listing other properties; Colour strip with appropriate interference colours and birefringences for the main rock-forming minerals. This book will be useful to undergraduate students of mineralogy, petrology and geochemistry, especially those at third or fourth year, engaged in more advanced courses or specialized projects, and also as a reference work for students for 'Masters' degrees by taught courses or research. For doctorate students, and research workers in the Earth Sciences as well as those in Materials Science and other related disciplines, this work can be useful as a condensed version of the very extensive treatment presented in the volumes of the DHZ Series 'Rock-Forming Minerals', second edition.

Petrology : the study of igneous sedimentary metamorphic rocks
All geoscience students need to understand the origins, environments and basic processes that produce igneous and metamorphic rocks. This concise textbook, written specifically for one-semester undergraduate courses, provides students with the key information they need to understand these processes. Topics are organized around the types of rocks to expect in a given tectonic environment, rather than around rock classifications: this is much more interesting and engaging for students, as it applies petrology to real geologic environments. This textbook includes over 250 illustrations and photos, and is supplemented by additional color photomicrographs made freely available online. Application boxes throughout the text encourage students to consider how petrology connects to wider aspects of geology, including economic geology, geologic hazards and geophysics. End-of-chapter exercises allow students to apply the concepts they have learnt and practice interpreting petrologic data.

"The book summarizes the author's experimental studies of phase relations in the chemical systems relevant to Earth, carried out in a time period of over 20 years using piston-cylinder and multi-avil presses. The results from the high-pressure studies by many other experimental petrologists were also included. The data were used to develop an internally consistent thermodynamic model, which was then used to calculate phase diagrams. This produced the largest collection of the calculated phase diagrams published so far, encompassing for the first time the temperature and pressure ranges corresponding to the whole upper mantle."--BOOK JACKET.
This edited work contains the most recent advances related to the study of layered intrusions and cumulate rocks formation. The first part of this book presents reviews and new views of processes producing the textural, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of layered igneous rocks. The second part summarizes progress in the study of selected layered intrusions and their ore deposits from different parts of the world including Canada, Southwest China, Greenland and South Africa. Thirty experts have contributed to this update on recent research on Layered Intrusions. This highly informative book will provide insight for researchers with an interest in geology, igneous petrology, geochemistry and mineral resources.
