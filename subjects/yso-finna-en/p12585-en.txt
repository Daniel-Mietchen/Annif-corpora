Making space : the development of spatial representation and reasoning
This volume highlights the role of space in enhancing understandings of children's ordinary, everyday experiences, bringing together spatial theory and the interdisciplinary field of childhood studies. Contributors to Children's Spatialities argue that spatial perspectives are central to understanding how children's practices and trajectories are situated within more-than-social contexts. This lens opens up ways of understanding children's lives that move beyond the notion of the individual agent to recognise that agency exists within and between the spaces where children's lives happen. As such, this is a book about the intersectionality between space and cross-disciplinary approaches to childhood studies. In examining these intersections, its contributors ask: What new insights or interpretations does a critical spatial perspective of children's everyday lives offer? What are the implications for spatial theory and practice when children's lives become the primary focus of research?
