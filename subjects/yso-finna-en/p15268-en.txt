Abstract: Process Improvement Analysis of Sysmex dealership in Roche Diagnostics Oy. This thesis is a process improvement analysis of operational work processes used to manage a global dealership contract in a Finnish company. It aims to improve the efficiency of the workflow, ensure policy compliancy and identify and reduce risks embedded in the process. The changes suggested to the processes also consider minimizing the differences between other processes. The thesis is as a practical development project and is highly pragmatic. Its deliverables are detailed process description at its current state, change plan and change control document. The scope of the research is limited to the work performed by the Order Management Coordinator responsible of Sysmex dealership management and further limited to few relevant product groups. The process flow starts from forecasting purchases and continues in their procurement, warehousing and delivery. The process is first described as it is currently, followed by qualitative research on possible improvement areas and concludes in description of suggested changes to the process. The research utilizes relevant operations management and process management techniques and theory. Main approach is that process is analysed in greatest detail and visualised by using flowcharts.
Turning consumers into partners : creating opportunities for business model innovation in retailing
This thesis deals with the software company's business expansion via reseller channel. The case company is a Finnish software company M-files Oy. Part of the company's core strategy is a strong international growth via reseller channel. M-Files has already resellers in 50 countries and over 2,000 paying customers in 100 countries. Aim of this study is to explore the Swedish software market, as well as possibly find partners in the target country. In addition, the company can use the results of the work when it searches for new international partners from different countries. The research work is a single case study and is divided into theoretical part and an empirical part. The theoretical part presents the software company's business expansion and internationalization via reseller channel. The data were collected using a different literature, articles and internet. The empirical part presents results and conclusions.The study was conducted using a qualitative research method by interviewing Swedish ICT organizations and M-Files staff. The interviews were semi-structured interviews, which were designed to collect comprehensive information on the existing software market in Sweden. The research findings reveal that the Swedish software market is very similar to the Finnish software market. The Swedish market is highly competitive and it consists of global software development companies and small, innovative niche-oriented companies. Software market in Sweden is centralized in southern Sweden. Swedish companies and customers are willing to use new technologies and solutions if they can see that solutions can give real benefits and competitive advantage. This opens up opportunities for new products and services in the Swedish software market. The market is changing in such a way that the information value of the business is valued more than technical solutions.^The study identified a number of characteristics and issues that should take into account when a software company expands business to the Swedish software market. Software companies can also apply methods used in the research when they are analyzing new market areas or business opportunities in a new country.

"Retailing is changing extremely rapidly in the emerging economies, both as a driver of social and economic change, and a consequence of economic development and the rise of consumer societies. Changes that took many decades in Europe or North America are happening at a much greater speed in emerging markets while regulations continue to be hotly contested in these markets, raising questions about appropriate business strategies for both globalising firms and local contenders. While much has been written about retail in emerging markets, the focus has been primarily on the nature of entry strategies for western retail companies. This book seeks to capture the impact of both internal and external regulations on retail development and strategy in emerging markets. It provides a comprehensive and up to date assessment of the development of retailing in a wide range of emerging economies, and seeks to capture the interplay between both retail policy and retail strategy and the theoretical implications of this on retail development as a whole. This book will be of interest to academics, researchers and advanced students with an interest in retail development in emerging markets, international business/strategy and international marketing"--
"The aim of shopper marketing is to convert browsing shoppers into active purchasers at the point of sale. Although a relatively new area of marketing, it has attracted increased investment year on year - and according to surveys is growing even faster than internet advertising. Edited by two highly respected practitioners, Shopper Marketing demonstrates how marketers can influence the buying decision in-store, including practical advice on shopper needs and trends, retail environments, effective packaging and much more. The second edition has been fully updated and revised, with new material on shopper marketing in the international context and a new foreword by marketing guru Philip Kotler"--
