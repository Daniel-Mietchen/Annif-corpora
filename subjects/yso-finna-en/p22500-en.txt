Marmara University Faculty of Fine Arts International Student Triennial, that has brought together numerous art and design schools from around 60 different countries in İstanbul since its establishment in 1997, has continued to strengthen the dialogue between different branches of art and geographies. The productions we see in the exhibition catalogue, the outcomes of 13 of the 38 workshops, centre on our lives shaped by the city and question many issues. Works that focus on public space, the city, architecture, animal rights, body, memory, identity, and the city of İstanbul also create an archive of the experiences gathered throughout the whole process and offer a concrete outcome; they also attempt to connect the dots by focusing on different segments of the society.
