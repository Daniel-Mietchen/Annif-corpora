The focus of the below mentioned thesis is on the intercultural differences related to working with German and Chinese media and company’s provided information material. The Asian market has a huge potential for companies. Creating awareness of the company through media is an effective method, but there are differences in handling media relations in various countries. Thus arise research questions which ask how does media relations especially information materials and brochures in Germany and China differ? Which are the major differences? The thesis includes theoretical knowledge about the handling of public and media relations, and their influencing factors based on systematic research on literature, the Internet and statistics. The practical part of the thesis consists of an analysis of German and Chinese information material and a case study of Deutsche Post DHL, an international logistics group. Its media relations activities in both countries were explained based on an expert interview. Further, DHL’s information brochures for Chinese and German target group were evaluated by Chinese and German students within a phenomenological process. One of the major outcomes of the thesis is that political restriction related to media, changes journalists’ esteem and way of working. Chinese and German Information brochures differ in their use of visual effects and the amount of demanded information. Moreover, considering cultural habits and trends is essential for successfully managing media relations. In the future new communication technology might alter handling of media relations.

Whatever your job, you need to communicate with others, as even when your intentions are sound, the impact of a bad conversation can be highly destructive. If people in your work community form a negative opinion of you, they stop properly listening. Rob explains how and why your career success can depend so much on good communication at work. Each chapter is short and self-contained, focusing on a specific topic with clear steps for action and a key lesson. As in Blamestorming, there is a cast of characters placed in a variety of situations in which they experience conversations go wrong. Using five simple 'warning signs' to watch out for Rob explains how the characters could change the way they speak and listen in order to achieve a positive outcome.

Change is now so commonplace that people no longer talk in terms of the "whitewater epoch". Every sector of the economies of the developed world has experienced huge swathes of change in the last decade of the twentieth century alone. Increased global competition, aided and abetted by technological advances, has led many organizations to seek to re-invent themselves in the hope of being able to survive and thrive. In mature sectors in particular, where the pace of consolidation is accelerating, organizations have had little option but to grow through acquisition or be absorbed. Whether the change is labelled "continuous process improvement", "restructuring", "downsizing" or re-engineering", to employees, change usually brings with it added pressures, job insecurity and a consequent loss of commitment to the organization. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success argues that strategic change in the new millennium will be geared increasingly to achieving sustainable high performance, rather than just short-term gains. Most theorists now agree that the real challenge of change lies in gaining employees" willingness to commit to the change effort. Change leaders at every level need to be able to understand the elements at work in any change process, and to use judgement about the style of leadership required to give the change effort the best chance of success. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success provides an overview of change and organizational theory, leading in particular to the author"s definition of the "input" elements of the high performance organisation, based on extensive research into UK and international organisations. It also contains a section looking at the management of change, with case studies illustrating approaches to managing change which are conducive to achieving sustainable high performance. In her companion book, The High Performance Organization- creating dynamic stability, the author explores some of the "how to"s" of building an organizational culture which is supportive of high performance in today"s challenging environment.

The commissioner of this thesis is Prorink International, a company specialized in products and services required for sporting and recreational ice areas. The objective of this thesis is to find suitable ways for SMEs, the commissioner in particular, to develop their marketing and to become more international. The marketing part was the author’s idea and the commissioners wish was to also help them become more international. The theoretical part consists of marketing and internationalization theories, provided by acknowledged professionals on their fields. First, marketing principles are discussed and some attention is also given to B2B marketing, which is the market the commissioner operates in. The marketing theories are followed by internationalization and international marketing principles. The last theoretical part deals with marketing communication and distribution strategies. Desktop research was used in making the theoretical framework. The outcome of this thesis is recommendations for the commissioner on how to improve their marketing and what needs to be considered when becoming more international. This thesis suggests the commissioner some useful marketing activities to use on daily basis. In addition, this thesis provides the commissioner and readers with useful theories on marketing and internationalization. As a conclusion, the recommendations are there for the commissioner to work as a guideline and are mainly to be used for the ice paints but they can be easily modified and used to other products as well. There might be some issues in taking the recommendations into action due to lack of resources, even though they are chosen to suit an SME. As for development suggestions a business plan would be something very useful for the company and the commissioner could get OUAS students to do that for them.

Abstract: Athletes as endorsers : sports stars playing in the field of advertising. This thesis studies the celebrity endorsement model and specially athletes as endorsers. What drives the companies to use athletes as spokesperson and how do they cope with risks involved in it? As recently news have been filled with scandals involving athletes with multimillion endorsement deals how could have these been avoided and what are the effects on endorsing companies? Main focus of the study is to investigate what kind of methods marketers use to ensure a successful endorsement campaign? Secondary focus was on researching what kind of risks companies face when cooperating with a star athlete? This thesis uses secondary data as its main source of information. Conducted research show that even though use of athletes as endorsers can be very risky, it can also lead to success. In celebrity endorsement only certainty is uncertainty. It was also discovered that marketers often value extremely different attributes when selecting a female endorser than they do with male endorsers.

"William Ury, coauthor of the international bestseller Getting to Yes, returns with another groundbreaking book, this time asking: how can we expect to get to yes with others if we haven't first gotten to yes with ourselves? Renowned negotiation expert William Ury has taught tens of thousands of people from all walks of life--managers, lawyers, factory workers, coal miners, schoolteachers, diplomats, and government officials--how to become better negotiators. Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually our own selves--our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests. But this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others. In this prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury offers a seven-step method to help you reach agreement with yourself first, dramatically improving your ability to negotiate with others. Practical and effective, Getting to Yes with Yourself helps readers reach good agreements with others, develop healthy relationships, make their businesses more productive, and live far more satisfying lives"
Intercultural encounters : the fundamentals of intercultural communication
The commissioner of this thesis, ebrand Suomi Oy, is a digital media agency possessing significant ability and knowledge of social media but they have trouble communicating this value for the customers even though they have a good presence in social media. The objective of this thesis is to develop a proper social media marketing communications plan for ebrand Suomi Oy, which could eventually be turned into a product package that the commissioner could offer to customers. Even though social media is becoming more important in people's daily lives, the main emphasis has been on the consumer side, which is why it is very relevant and timely to consider social media marketing communications from a B2B perspective. The theoretical section consists of the basic concepts of marketing before focusing on how to deliver value to customers via relationship marketing and integrated marketing communications, after which, social media marketing is discussed. Supported by this theory, the actions required of ebrand Suomi Oy to improve their marketing communications on each of the chosen social media channels will be presented. The research methods are qualitative and desktop research was applied when the theoretical background was conducted while using highly topical references. The final result of this thesis is a social media marketing communications plan. It will provide the means to become a thought leader in the industry while generating leads and building stronger relationships with current and future customers. The thesis also examines the somewhat unfamiliar aspect of social media in B2B use and provides insight on why social media is just as efficient in B2B use, as it is in the consumer industry.The plan might prove slightly difficult for ebrand to follow, as they might not possess the required resources to fully implement it. A recommendation considering this problem has been made to hire internships to provide content and monitor the efficiency of the plan. To aid in the implementation of the plan, a year clock of activities was composed which should prove useful when implementing the plan. It should be noted that with slight alterations, this marketing communications plan can be utilised for both B2C and B2B companies.

Backgrounds Non-profit organizations (NPOs) have considerable contributions to a nation nowadays such as creating more jobs, generating more GDP. These organizations have also occupied the attention of researchers for several years, especially new dimensions of marketing communications in non-profit context. For example, Damayani (2006) conducted a research on communications in drawing customers' attention into new and improved offerings of a community library. Perkins (2009) researched on a valuable approach to build and sustain relationship with different individuals, groups, communities and other organizations in USA. Non-profit Technology Network (2012) researched possibly effective communication channels for NPOs. Therefore, issues of marketing communication in NPOs are worth considering to research.In addition, fundraising is reported to be the top priority communication goals in NPOs 2014, according to Nonprofit Marketing Guide.com 2014; Finland is informed to be a country having a large number of NPOs (157000 organization in 2007), according to National Report Finland, European Commission (2007). However, studies on marketing communication were limited only to US regions and did not cover areas of other countries, such as Finland. Therefore, it is significant to do research into the topic of marketing communications to attract fundraising in Finnish NPOs. Objective The thesis focuses on research on marketing communication channels that can be utilized to raise fund for Finnish NPOs. Methodology In this thesis, case study research method was chosen to fulfill the research objective. UFF was used as a case study of this research. The data were collected from primary and secondary sources. Primary data were extracted from a semi-structured interview.Secondary data were mainly obtained from documentaries. Findings The findings of this research reveal that low-cost advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, website and social media can be utilized in Finnish NPOs to raise fund. However, the findings do not show clearly that whether or not sales promotion can be used in such organizations

Abstract: Facebook is one of the most used online communities in the social media, which encourages  companies to launch their own Facebook page. This work's employer  Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) is planning on launching its own page. TVO aims on  using Facebook as one channel for its external corporate communication. The objective  of this study was to make a proposal for the content of this Facebook page. The  proposal is intended to help the communications unit of TVO in planning, maintaining  and developing the page. The topic was approached from the perspective of organizational  communication.  The study is an action research used with qualitative research methods, such as the  benchmarking method of analysis and interviewing. Before interviewing took place  benchmarking was used to ascertain the organization most suited for interviewing,  namely the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The benchmarking process  was done by monitoring the Facebook pages of seven different target organizations  for a month. The features chosen for monitoring were the most suitable in terms  of the work. After this an interview was executed as a half-structured interview. The  interviewee was a publicist of STUK. The analysis and interpretation of the interview  was based on a dialogue between the research data and theory.  This study showed that public relations make up one of Facebook's key functions  from the perspective of organizational communications. It also became evident that  through Facebook TVO can reach important stakeholders, such as young adults.  Based on the study results it should also be said that the maintenance and development  of a Facebook page require a lot of personnel resources.  The output of this action research was produced, i.e. a proposal on TVO's Facebook  page content plan was completed. The results of this research could best be utilized  by a company such as the nuclear company TVO.

Nowadays, digital solutions and social online interaction are commonly used for educational purposes. One of the pioneers who offers modern and innovative solutions for e-learning is Finnish company HappyWise Ltd. based in Oulu. Due to low resources and lack of know-how HappyWise Ltd needs support to the planning of marketing activities and therefore the authors implemented marketing plan for which market research about their e-learning programme HappyWise Trainer was conducted. Hence, the main aspect is marketing plan which includes various analyses e.g. about macro environment and competitors. Marketing mix will be outlined through 4 P’s: product, place, price and promotion. Based on these, marketing communications plan is discussed and recommendations are presented. Unfortunately the market research was unsuccessful resulting from practical part which is discussed more specifically later in this thesis. However, the marketing plan was successfully completed with the support of theoretical framework. Forthcoming step to HappyWise is to concentrate on essential marketing activities and consider having position in personnel focusing only on this.
