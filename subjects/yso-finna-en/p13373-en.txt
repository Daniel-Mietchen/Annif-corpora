The national memory is often signified by means of monuments erected in the landscape, while commemorative historical sites always carry a story from the past, and it is not a matter of indifference how this story is told. Karelia, and particularly the areas of the Karelian Isthmus, the shores of Lake Ladoga and the Karelian Borderlands that were ceded to the Soviet Union as a consequence of the Second World War, are places where the commemorative sites have been objects of dispute for the last 60 years. Memories of Finnish Karelia have been erased, transformed and brought to life again: erased and transformed by the post-war masters of the area, for whom it was ideologically most appropriate to replace the Finnish narrative with one telling of victory in the Great Patriotic War and alluding to new sites commemorating the region's Russian history. The more recent revival of Finnish memories has been brought about not only by the Finns but also by Russians who have wished to tell the presentday inhabitants of Karelia about the forgotten and suppressed details of its more recent history.

Border Karelia is the former heartland of the Finnish-Karelian Orthodox culture. It has also been regarded, along with Viena Karelia, as a mythical place, the last reserve of the 'original Finnish' Kalevala culture. After the Continuation War ended in 1945, Finland was forced to cede Border Karelia to the Soviet Union. It was then populated with citizens from other parts of the Union, and became for 45 years inaccessible for Finns. In post-war Finland the ceded Karelia gained a new nostalgic aura, while the Soviet (Russian) attitude towards the territories was largely determined by political constructions and 'Soviet nationalism'. The present Border Karelia is a rather poor Russian territory, characterized by a multifaceted identity and heritage. Remnants of prewar cultural landscapes, villages and buildings are still evident. They arouse concern and emotions amongst Finns and pre-war inhabitants touring the area, but there's currently also an increasing interest among the Russians in the history and pre-war reality of the territory. The article discusses the concept of built heritage in relation to these different identities, and the uses of the Karelian past. The main objective of the research is to find a means to unite presentday Finnish and Russian interests regarding the maintenance and use of the heritage.
