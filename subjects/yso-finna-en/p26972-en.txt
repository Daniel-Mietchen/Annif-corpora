"Retro is hip, and vintage is cult. The esthetics of past eras are back in style in the world of fashion, as well as interior and product design. Brands successfully reissue old originals, while creative professionals around the world design innovative products with a retro look. Their scope of inspiration extends from Bauhaus to hip-hop. This volume presents comebacks and new interpretations, products and styles that are more fashionable today than ever before. Between the opposing poles of nostalgia and high-tech, the designers prove their niftiness and sense of humor. Whether kidney-shaped tables, aviator glasses, or printable radios, the past is returning full of charm and with a twinkle in the eye. Retro & vintage design serves as a reference book of design history and a source of inspiration for trend-setters at the same time."--Back cover.

"This volume brings together the concepts that underpin a One Health approach and a range of examples of this approach in action around a variety of emerging infectious diseases. The first section starts with a human clinical perception, brings in the veterinary and human-animal interface perspective and then links this with environment issues, with a special chapter dealing with wildlife. It concludes by looking at the economics of a One Health approach, both in terms of the costs of delivering a One Health approach as well as the value added. The second section looks at a number of key emerging infectious diseases and in each case details how a One Health approach has added value, particularly in terms of disease control and cost outcomes. The examples cover virus, bacterial, protozoal and parasitic infections and provide case studies at the national, regional and global level. The studies themselves vary in depth and detail but provide an engaging set of examples of the value of a One Health approach. In all cases, the authors have local and personal experience of the disease in question, providing real life examples of what can be achieved. The final chapter entitled 'Men, primates and germs: an ongoing affair' provides a fascinating insight into pathogen host switching between closely related species which serves to illustrate a core value of a One Health approach." -- (Back Cover)
