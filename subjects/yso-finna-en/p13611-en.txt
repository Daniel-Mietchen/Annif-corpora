For highly applied undergraduate and graduate marketing management or strategy courses. An all-purpose approach to strategic marketing management. Because strategic marketing is the essential marketing activity, Mooradian provides students with a highly applied decision-making framework and exploration of the tools that can be used to solve marketing problems. Guiding students through the material: Decision-Making Framework. The framework in this text involves four essential decision-making stages: (1) Situation Assessment; (2) Strategy Formation; (3) Implementation (Positioning and the Marketing Mix); and (4) Documentation, Assessment, and Adjustment. Each stage includes several additional steps and necessitates the application of any number of specific tools or analyses, depending on the situation. Providing the tools necessary for solving marketing problems: Tool Set. This text contains a comprehensive, organized collection of brief notes, each describing a specific tool of strategic marketing analysis and planning. Overall, these materials make up the essential knowledge of strategic marketing.
