This directory contains document corpora intended for training Annif models.
The corpora (in Finnish, Swedish and English) are based on metadata that has
been extracted from the Finna.fi service via its open API. The CC0 license
applies to all such metadata and thus also to these corpora.

The corpora are stored in the [short text document corpus
format](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Corpus-formats#short-text-document-corpus-tsv-file)
supported by Annif.
