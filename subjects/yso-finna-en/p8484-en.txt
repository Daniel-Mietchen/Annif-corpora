In this book, Anthony DiMaggio uses the war in Iraq and the United States confrontations with Iran as his touchstones to probe the sometimes fine line between news and propaganda. Using Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony and drawing upon the seminal works of Noam Chomsky, Edward Herman, and Robert McChesney, DiMaggio combines a rigorousempirical analysis and clear, lucid prose to enlighten readers about issues essential to the struggle for a critical media and a functioning democracy. If, as DiMaggio shows, our newspapers and television news programs play a decisive role in determining what we think, and if, as he demonstrates convincingly, what the media give us is largely propaganda that supports an oppressive and undemocratic status quo, then it is incumbent upon us to make sure that they are responsive to the majority and not just the powerful and privileged few.

It is probably true to say that television, as a mass medium, prides itself on its accuracy, balance and objectivity in providing news. Indeed, by law, broadcasters in Britain are required to ensure that factual coverage of political parties and topics, matters of industrial conflict and social policy is duly impartial and accurate. However accusations of bias are not infrequent, and are generally characterised by aggrieved parties claiming to have been treated unfairly, misrepresented or under-represented. Some of the most severe critics of television have been politicians. Measuring Bias on Television explores the important issue of impartiality in news reporting, with special reference to news broadcasting on television. Barrie Gunter examines the position of impartiality or bias conceptually within the context of news objectivity, which itself represents a central aspect of performance and quality in television and other forms of news provision. Measuring Bias on Television will be of particular interest to journalism and media undergraduates, media policy makers and practitioners.

The underlying assumptions of Finnish neutrality
During the first twelve months of World War I President Woodrow Wilson had a sincere desire to maintain American neutrality. The president, however, soon found this position unsustainable. As Wilson sought to mediate an end to the European conflict he realized that the war presented an irresistible opportunity to strengthen the US economy though expanded trade with the Allies. As this carefully argued study shows, the contradiction between Wilson's idealistic and pragmatic aims ultimately drove him to abandon neutrality in late 1915 - helping to pave the way for America's entrance into the war. -- Publisher website.
