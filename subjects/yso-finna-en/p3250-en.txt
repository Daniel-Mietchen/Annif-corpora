Tooth eruption in Skolt Lapp children
New imaging technologies are needed for the early detection of dental caries, especially in high risk regions such as the interproximal and occlusal surfaces. The objective of this thesis work was to investigate the potential of near infrared (NIR) imaging methods for the detection and assessment of early enamel caries. If detected in the early stages, enamel caries can often be treated by nonsurgical methods that promote the tissue remineralization and repair without the need for restorative intervention. This work demonstrated that NIR wavelengths, especially 1310 nm, are well suited for imaging enamel dental caries. NIR transillumination and Polarization Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT) are two promising optical imaging systems that were studied in this work and addressed the needed improvements to measure depth resolved changes in enamel demineralization and remineralization.

A NIR transillumination system was employed to acquire high contrast images of simulated interproximal lesions showing significant advantages over visible light and x-ray imaging for caries detection. The potential of Polarization Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT), an imaging system that has found broad applications in medicine and biology, was examined for occlusal caries detection. PS-OCT was useful for enhancing the image contrast of caries, minimizing the interference of surface reflections, and quantifying the severity of caries lesions through a straightforward integration method. This work found that the method to quantify the lesion severity had a strong correlation to the overall lesion mineral volume loss. PS-OCT had the ability to monitor the progression of artificial enamel caries lesions on occlusal surfaces and image lesions underneath composite sealants. PS-OCT was used to image the remineralization of several different artificial lesion models. One such model demonstrated that PS-OCT can image the repair and restoration of the surface zone enamel after remineralization. NIR transillumination and PS-OCT have promising potential for in vivo applications to non-destructively detect and monitor early enamel caries with greater success than conventional methods.

The future role of NIR transillumination is likely to be a detection system, capable of screening the dentition for early decay, with PS-OCT providing more valuable diagnostic information on lesion assessment, especially with occlusal lesions.
