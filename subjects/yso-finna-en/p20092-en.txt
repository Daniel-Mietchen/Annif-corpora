institutions of higher education in visual arts
The book Almost a centimeter is the result of Make Your Own Press, a collective effort of 5 professors and 16 students from 3 distinct academies in the Baltic and Nordic region, and 5 visiting lecturers and critics, invited because of their outstanding efforts in the field of artist book making and publishing. The book emerged from a course that recognizes the explosion in artist book making all around the world, especially in lieu of the less than terminal death of print predicted now for many years. This resurgence of print was something the group wanted to aid, particularly in their region, by giving a younger generation a course that presented all the steps necessary in taking a book from its concept, through its relation to historical antecedents, design, paper and color selection, the printing process, and finally distribution and acting as a temporary publishing house. Six teams made a 16-page section each reflecting on various aspects of what it takes to realize a publication: The Author, The Editor, The Designer, The Printer, The Distributer, and The Reader.
