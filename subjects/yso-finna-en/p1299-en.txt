The author, a successful Buddhist teacher, software designer, musician and author, contracted viral encephalitis, a rare brain disease, and went into a coma for 10 days. While recovering, he experienced an acute neuropsychiatric complication from a therapeutic drug that posed a second life-threatening challenge. This account of his slow and spotty recovery is both a Buddhist teaching story and an account of the deeply rooted fears and anxieties that became Richmond's companions on the healing journey.

Altered conditions : disease, medicine and storytelling
Altered conditions provides a bold new intervention into existing theories of the human body and its meanings in a variety of cultural contexts. By exploring the history of medical narratives, especially medical case histories, as well as the exciting work that has been done in feminist and lesbian and gay studies, Julia Epstein poses a number of provocative questions about the relations between bodies, selves, and identities. Epstein focuses on a number of diagnoses that shed light on what is at stake when cultures regulate human bodies, including hermaphroditism, birth malformations, and AIDS. She pays special attention to the regulation of sexual minorities and women and looks carefully at the ways in which cultures attempt to define and control behaviors seen as threatening or subversive.
