With the Lapps in the High Mountains is an entrancing true account, a classic of travel literature, and a work that deserves wider recognition as an early contribution to ethnographic writing. Published in 1913 and available here in its first English translation, it is the narrative of Emilie Demant Hatt's nine-month stay in the tent of a Sami family in northern Sweden in 1907-8 and her participation in a dramatic reindeer migration over snow-packed mountains to Norway with another Sami community in 1908. A single woman in her thirties, Demant Hatt immersed herself in the Sami language and culture. She writes vividly of daily life, women's work, children's play, and the care of reindeer herds in Lapland a century ago. While still an art student in Copenhagen in 1904, Demant Hatt had taken a vacation trip to northern Sweden, where she chanced to meet Sami wolf hunter Johan Turi. His dream of writing a book about his people sparked her interest in the culture, and she began to study the Sami language at the University of Copenhagen. Though not formally trained as an ethnographer, she had an eye for detail. The journals, photographs, sketches, and paintings she made during her travels with the Sami enriched her eventual book, and in With the Lapps in the High Mountains she memorably portrays people, dogs, reindeer, and the beauty of the landscape above the Arctic Circle. This English-language edition also includes photographs by Demant Hatt, an introduction by translator Barbara Sjoholm, and a foreword by Hugh Beach, author of A Year in Lapland: Guest of the Reindeer Herders.

"Popular Legacies: The Politics of Custom in Eighteenth-Century British Fiction breaks new ground in the history of the eighteenth-century British novel by revealing the persistent influence of popular culture and of an older, patrician model of social relations--what Bowen terms "customary culture"--on novelistic representation as well as on the British imagination as a whole. Resisting a teleological literary history that views the novel's rise as one of increasing refinement and politeness, Bowen draws from a variety of popular sources, such as the criminal broadside, ballad, graphic prints and pantomimes to foreground the eighteenth-century novel's cultural and social hybridity. Popular Legacies further argues that representations of popular and laboring culture serve in the eighteenth-century novel as repositories of traditional social values, reflecting an older, two-part patrician-plebeian social order that authors such as Defoe, Richardson, Smollett and Godwin strategically mobilize in order both to impede and make palatable Britain's transition to a modern, capitalist and imperial state"--Provided by publisher.

Cannibalism. It's the last, greatest taboo: the stuff of urban legends and ancient myths, airline crashes and Captain Cook. Today cannibalism belongs to history - or, at the very least, the realm of the weird, the rare and the very far away. Bill Schutt digs his teeth into the subject to find an answer that is as surprising as it is unsettling.
