"The study of language has changed enormously over the last two decades. Many of the ideas which have become current in the twenty-first century challenge our notions about who we are and to what extent we are unique in nature. Word of Mouth introduces these ideas to the reader in a fresh, engaging and jargon-free way. It assumes no prior knowledge of language study, just an interest in the power of words and the way they shape and influence our lives. Geoffrey Finch begins with a discussion of the evolution of language, suggesting that the acquisition of language was a cognitive leap forward with significant repercussions for what we understand by the term 'human nature'. Subsequent chapters explore the social and communicative functions of language, its structure and psychology, as well as the impact of electronic media on contemporary usage. Ideal for the general reader and students of language and communication, Word of Mouth is a stimulating introductory guide to a fascinating subject."--BOOK JACKET.

Contemporary public speaking
In this wide-ranging collection, leading scholars, researchers, and emergent researchers from around the world come together and present examples of multimodal discourse analysis in practice. The book illustrates new theoretical, methodological and empirical research into new technologies such as the internet, software, CD-ROM, video, and older technologies such as film, newspapers, brands or billboards. Each chapter demonstrates how aspects of multimodal theory and method can be used to conduct research into these and other multimodal texts. Taken together, the book advances the field of multimodal discourse analysis and offers a range of current studies that address some of the most important questions facing researchers and students when investigating new or old technologies multimodally in linguistics, education, communication studies, sociology, anthropology and other fields.

Walter J. Ong's classic work provides a fascinating insight into the social effects of oral, written, printed and electronic technologies, and their impact on philosophical, theological, scientific and literary thought. This thirtieth anniversary edition - coinciding with Ong's centenary year - reproduces his best-known and most influential book in full and brings it up to date with two new exploratory essays by cultural writer and critic John Hartley. Hartley provides: A scene-setting chapter that situates Ong's work within the historical and disciplinary context of post-war Americanism and the rise of communication and media studies; A closing chapter that follows up Ong's work on orality and literacy in relation to evolving media forms, with a discussion of recent criticisms of Ong's approach, and an assessment of his concept of the 'evolution of consciousness'; Extensive references to recent scholarship on orality, literacy and the study of knowledge technologies, tracing changes in how we know what we know. These illuminating essays contextualize Ong within recent intellectual history, and display his work's continuing force in the ongoing study of the relationship between literature and the media, as well as that of psychology, education and sociological thought.
