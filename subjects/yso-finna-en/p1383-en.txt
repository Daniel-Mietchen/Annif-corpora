The objective of this paper was to explore the subject of forestry partners programs, a type of wood supply resource to the pulp mills in Brazil, and its impact on the cost of eucalyptus wood, i.e. which changes did it cause in the cost of eucalyptus wood to the pulp mill, whether the wood coming from the programs are of a lower cost or more expensive to the mill and the influence of land charges in the cost of the wood. The second objective was to identify the reasons for the migration of the pulp producing companies to the Southern Hemisphere. The third objective was to verify the trend in use of forestry partners programs by the pulp mills in Brazil. The theoretical background for this research consist of Michael Porter's Five Competitive Forces Model, for addressing the competitive environment of the pulp and paper industry, and Porter's Three Generic Strategies of Competitive Advantage to provide the foundation for the analysis of the cost components of paper and pulp manufacturing in different regions in the world, the eucalyptus wood cost components and its competitiveness as a fiber resource for pulp production, and the cost competitiveness of forestry partners programs in the supply of eucalyptus wood for pulp manufacturing. Primary data was collected through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with three experts in the pulp and paper industry, from Pöyry Forest Industry Consulting, and through open, self-administered questionnaires, sent to three experts of the Brazilian forest sector: one professor of forestry at the University of São Paulo, one responsible for the forestry partners programs at the world's leading exporter of market pulp, Aracruz Celulose, and one responsible for the forestry partners programs at Brazil's largest paper and paperboard producer, Klabin. The results of this study show an increasingly important role of fast-growing plantations for the supply of wood to the pulp and paper industry due to its cost competitiveness, which justifies the growing presence of pulp producing companies in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Latin America. The study indicates that the wood derived from forestry partners programs come at a cheaper cost to the mill, than the wood grown in the mill's own plantations. The biggest advantage of forestry partners programs to the pulp mill is, however, the non-mobilization of capital in land. The trend in the use of forestry partners programs is moving upwards, as pulp and paper companies in Brazil seek to enlarge the percentage of wood deriving from the programs to an average of about 20% by the next few years.

Enzymes are studied in different fields of biotechnology to reduce energy consumption, environmental effects and costs for the industry. Enzymes allow more effective production and better product quality than the use of chemical compounds. Enzymes are produced and studied in batch, continuous or fed-batch fermentations. This study concentrates on fed-batch fermentation. The focus is on the production of enzymes for the pulp and paper industry and optimization of the yield and productivity of fed-batch fermentation. The enzymes examined in this study were produced intracellularly by bacterial cells. The optimization of the yield and productivity were examined with the use of different feed profiles to see the growth trends of bacterial cells and how they produce the desired enzymes in the presence of different concentrations of glucose. Optical density, enzyme activity, glucose and lactate were measured from the fermentations to get the results for yield and productivity. The optimal yield and productivity is achieved by finding a glucose feed rate which gives the best possible balance for cell growth and product formation. Based on the yield and productivity results, the fed-batch fermentation can be improved and stabilized. This study deals with enzymes in the pulp and paper industry, the differences between the fermentation types mentioned above, the fermentation procedure and sampling, as well as experiments with the feed profiles and the analyses, errors and results.
