Introduction to physics in modern medicine
Development and application of ultrasounc backscatter methods for the diagnostics of trabecular bone
"This updated text explains the physical principles governing medical imaging. It places different techniques in context with each other to provide historical perspective and insight on future developments. It also illustrates techniques through examples of clinical imaging applications. The book covers the use of x-rays in diagnostic radiology and computed tomography in radiotherapy planning. It also discusses the tools and techniques of radioisotope, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, infrared, and optical imaging, along with the mathematics involved in image formation and processing, image interpretation, and computational requirements of imaging systems"--Provided by publisher.
Solid state characterization of pharmaceuticals
"This books aims to demystify fundamental biophysics for students in the health and biosciences required to study physics and to understand the mechanistic behaviour of biosystems. The text is well supplemented by worked conceptual examples that will constitute the main source for the students, whilst combining conceptual examples and practice problems with more quantitative examples and recent technological advances"--

Physics for Biology and Medicine, 4e, covers topics in physics as they apply to the life sciences, specifically medicine, physiology, nursing and other applied health fields. This concise introductory paperback surveys and relates basic physics to living systems. It discusses biological systems that can be analyzed quantitatively and how advances in the life sciences have been aided by the knowledge of physical or engineering analysis techniques. Applicable courses are biophysics and applied physics. Provides practical techniques for applying knowledge of physics to the study of living systemsPresents material in a straight forward manner requiring very little background in physics or biologyIncludes many figures, examples and illustrative problems and appendices which provide convenient access to the most important concepts of mechanics, electricity, and optics.
