The dangerous rise of therapeutic education

Psychologisation in times of globalisation
"If you want to know something about man, don't study the human, don't study psychology, study psychologization...Jan De Vos starts where other critiques on psychology end, putting forward a breathtaking simple but most revealing argument: psychology is psychologization.This fresh and pioneering approach asks what it means to become the psychologist of one's own life. If something is not working in our education, in our marriage, in our work and in society in general we turn to the psy-sciences. But is the latter's paradigm precisely not relying on feeding psychological theories into the field of research and action?Jan De Vos traces psychologization back to the Enlightenment and then proceeds to late-modernity.
