This eagerly awaited study provides a complete record of Pugins extraordinary achievements in stained glass design and manufacture. Beautifully illustrated with photography by Alastair Carew-Cox, it shows how Pugin rose to the challenges of creating stained glass in the early Victorian period according to medieval principles; how he worked with leading makers of the day; how he forged a partnership with John Hardman of Birmingham; how this relationship worked; who his clients were; and, what he sought to express in the windows. These were made for churches and houses throughout Britain and Ireland and some also found their way to North America, Europe and the Antipodes. A detailed gazetteer gives all the known information about each window. This book is the culmination of many years research by the author and is based on his Ph.D thesis about Pugins stained glass. 420p, 150 col illus (Spire Books 2009). 'An important excellently researched book, about the leading designer of the 19th-century stained glass revival' - Alexandra Wedgwood.
