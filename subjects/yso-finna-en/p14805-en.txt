Quantified eco-efficiency : an introduction with applications
With the globally increasing environmental burdens and the recognition of the problem, industrial organisations have been encouraged to start defining, measuring and monitoring the environmental effects of their operations. The objective of this thesis was to design an environmental measurement system for Tikka Spikes Oy to measure the efficiency and performance of their environmental management system. The purpose was also to collect information on the company's environmental performance over the past three years (2010–2012), so that the current and future results may be compared with the past. This study was carried out as a three month project between November 2012 and January 2013. The theoretical section at the beginning of the thesis presents relevant information related to the environmental performance of an organisation. Data about the production quantities, energy consumption, waste generation and water utilisation of Tikka Spikes Oy were collected. The gathered data were utilised in measuring and estimating the environmental performance of the company. The data is presented in absolute, relative and trend formats. The thesis contains confidential material which is not included in the published version. The designed environmental measurement system gives a general overview of the key environmental characteristics and performance of Tikka Spikes Oy. The past results from the years 2010–2012 may be utilised to predict future trends. For example, estimating future environmental expenses may be done with the help of the designed environmental measurement system and the past results. In the future, the same key characteristics may be monitored in order to obtain continuous information on the development of the company's environmental performance. Further research would be required to obtain more detailed results on the environmental performance and the influence of the individual processes on it.
