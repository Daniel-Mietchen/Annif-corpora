Positive growth for Baltic Shortsea Shipping
The text of the Periplous or 'circumnavigation' that survives under the name of Skylax of Karyanda is in fact by an unknown author of the 4th century BC. It describes the coasts of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, naming hundreds of towns with geographical features such as rivers, harbours and mountains. But, argues Graham Shipley, it is not the record of a voyage or a navigational handbook for sailors. It is, rather, the first work of Greek theoretical geography, written in Athens at a time of intellectual ferment and intense speculation about the nature and dimensions of the inhabited world. While other scientists were gathering data about natural science and political systems or making rapid advances in philosophy, rhetorical theory, and cosmology, the unknown author collected data about the structure of the lands bordering the seas known to the Greeks, and compiled sailing distances and times along well-frequented routes. His aim was probably nothing less ambitious than to demonstrate the size of the inhabited world of the Greeks.

"The dhow and the steamship symbolised the struggle for control of Zanzibar's economy. The dhows were the craft which carried the triangular trade on seasonal winds between Arabia, East Africa and India. The colonial government saw dhows as a threat to their wish to modernise Zanzibar's economy." "Erik Gilbert compares the resilience of the dhow economy, with its ingenious evasions of government control and taxation, to the informal or second economy of the post-colonial era."--BOOK JACKET.
