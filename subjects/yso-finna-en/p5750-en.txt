Nutrition essentials for nursing practice
Micronutrient deficiency affects more than two billion people in the world today, contributing to the vicious cycle of malnutrition and underdevelopment. Micronutrient deficiencies have long-ranging effects on health, learning ability and productivity. Food-based approaches, which include food production, dietary diversification and food fortification, are sustainable strategies for improving the micronutrient status of populations. This book focuses on practical, sustainable actions for overcoming micronutrient deficiencies through increased access to, and consumption of, adequate quantities.

Twentieth century Europe went through a dramatic transition from low income populations experiencing hunger and nutritionally inadequate diets, to the recent era of over-consumption and growing numbers of overweight and obese people. By examining the trends in food history from case studies across Europe, this book offers a historical context to explain how and why this transition has occurred and what we can learn in order to try and address the vitally important issues arising from obesity in contemporary Europe.
