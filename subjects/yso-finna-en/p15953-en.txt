In 2013, the Nordic Ministers for the Environment decided to strenghten the measurement of green estimates of welfare and socio-economic developments. The report Making the Environment Count is describing how statistics on the environment and the economy thorugh the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts can be used to enable cross-sectorial analysis. The report proposes indicators that can be compiled annually in a Nordic context through existing statistics linking economic statistics to environmental statistics

The aim of this thesis was to study the energy consumption at the plant of Genencor International Inc. in Hanko. The intention was to develop a monitoring system for energy consumption anf energy efficiency covering steam and electricity. based on the survay, the purpose was to find potential energy savings and to improve the efficient use of energy by monitoring and narrowing the grey area of energy consumption. The distribution of energy was identifies and the most significant energy consumers were selected for more detailed analysis. The data collection version was developed on Excel whereas the visual version of the consumption system was created by using the OSI-PI software. In the consumption monitoring system are considered the most significant energy consumers and the biggest products. The energy consumption was calculated in theory and compared to the total use of energy. The error between the theoretical and the actual consumption was taken into account in the error consideration. The extent of the grey area proved to be greater than estimated, especially the grey area of steam consumption. The next phase will be to plan the identification of the grey area more accurately and perhaps to estimate the need for acquisitiion of new fixed meters for monitoring the energy consumption more reliably than at the present.
