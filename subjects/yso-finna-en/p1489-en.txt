The purpose of the research was to study the impacts of the 2009 financial crisis on the market for luxury clothing in Russia, especially in St. Petersburg. This included studying the changes in the economic situation in general, consumer demand, operations of the luxury companies during the crisis and the challenges for a new company planning to enter the market. The research was based on reports, articles and other written information sources by experts from the financial and fashion sectors as well as five intervies with professionals from the fashion industry in St. Petersburg. The research was conducted together with Jasmin Santanen Paris company. The research was conducted through thematic interviews with five interviewees: International relationship manager from a company organizing a fashion trade fair, the president of the unofficial fashion week of St. Petersburg, a manager of a luxury multi-brand store, a buyer from a department store and a sole entrepreneur. Common themes and opinions were then summarized and compared to the secondary information. It was discovered that the financial crisis of 2009 has had an impact on the luxury fashion market in St. Petersburg. The consumer demand has decreased; many companies have cut or delayed their operations and expansion plans. In addition to the direct effects of the financial crisis, many other challenges that a new luxury company faces in the Russian market, was discovered. These include the lack of experience and  qualified professionals, corruption, complicated tax and customs procedures and changing consumer preferences.

The objective of the study is to suggest a Japanese premium towel brand, Imabari Towel how to market its products in Germany. One intention of the study is to see the brand's appropriate positioning in the target market. Another intention is to demonstrate the general picture of the potential German customers and illustrate the important differences between them and the Japanese consumers. The last intention is to propose necessary adaptation of the marketing tools specifically for the targets. The challenge is approached by developing a marketing plan, which provides necessary information on the target market and guides the brand to entering Germany. The theoretical framework was based on different theories concerning the marketing planning processes and international marketing mainly by Wood, Stone and MacCall, Albaum and Duerr, and Czinkota and Ronkainen. The theoretical study provided the original framework of the marketing plan to be created in the following empirical part of study. The empirical part of the study was carried out in form of individual face-to-face interview with seven German potential consumers who would be interested in using the products of Imabari Towel. The purpose of the interviews was to gain deep understanding of the Germans' typical attitudes, behaviours and mindsets regarding buying and using of towels. Moreover, ten product samples of the brand were presented in the interviews, and the respondents' perception of the brand and its actual products were observed. The analytical approach was qualitative. The results revealed that the Germans tend to share some beliefs which influence on their behaviour in purchasing and using towels. The interviewees' impression of the brand turned out positive, but specific improvements were mentioned by them. At the same time, the findings suggested requirement for several critical adaptations on the brand's product to suit the needs of Germans, and also indicated how to make use of price, place and promotion in order to establish the desired brand in the Germany. In conclusion, the approach of developing a marketing plan to demonstrate how to market the brand in the target country worked very well. The interview results were applied to contents of the marketing plan, and the created marketing plan demonstrated all the recommendations for the brand: to position itself as a luxurious towel brand in Germany; to make necessary adaptations in each marketing tool according to the spotted behaviours and mindsets of the Germans regarding use and purchase of towels.
