Changes in the distribution of population in Finland over the period 1970-1998 are examined in terms of a co-ordinate system of 1 x 1 km grid cells. The results indicate that this system provides suitable areal units for a variety of statistical and GIS methods aimed at describing and explaining the spatial distribution of population. The system is capable of yielding more detailed information than heretofore on topics such as the concentration of population in the urban centres of Finland - a process that has been going on since the beginning of the last century, but has slowed down noticeably in the recent years.

"Preface Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are becoming extremely important in various decision making processes. They provide an opportunity to make educated and profitable decisions. The trend is growing considerably, and GIS data is being used in complex decision-making. As such, it is essential to not only explore spatial data, but to also generate the best solution. The integration of GIS and optimization system is desirable for tackling such problems. This integration can be applied to numerous fields, such as hydrology and water resources, environment and ecology, waste management and urban planning, and routing problems. This book deals with the basic concepts of GIS and optimization. It provides an overview of various integration protocols that are termed as GIS-O integration strategies applied to practical applications. An integration approach for the vehicle routing problem with resource and distance requirements is developed and approved by numerical results. This book will be useful for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners who try to implement upgraded systems that derive benefits of both the GIS and the optimization"--

"Preface What is big data? Due to increased interest in this phenomenon, many recent papers and reports have focused on defining and discussing this subject. A review of these publications would point to a consensus about how big data is perceived and explained. It is widely agreed that big data has three specific characteristics: volume, in terms of large-scale data storage and processing; variety, or the availability of data in different types and formats; and velocity, which refers to the fast rate of new data acquisition. These characteristics are widely referred to as the three Vs of big data, and while projects involving datasets that only feature one of these Vs are considered to be big, most datasets from such fields as science, engineering, and social media feature all three Vs. To better understand the recent spurt of interest in big data, I provide here a new and different perspective on it. I argue that the answer to the question of "What is big data?" depends on when the question is asked, what application is involved, and what computing resources are available. In other words, understanding what big data is requires an analysis of time, applications, and resources. In light of this, I categorize the time element into three groups: past (since the introduction of computing several decades ago), near-past (within the last few years), and present (now). One way of looking at the time element is that, in general, big data in the past meant dealing with gigabyte-sized datasets, in the near-past, terabyte-sized datasets, and in the present, petabyte-sized datasets. I also categorize the application element into three groups: scientific (data used for complex modeling, analysis, and simulation), business (data used for business analysis and modeling), and general"--
