Applies lean manufacturing principles across the cloud service delivery chain to enable application and infrastructure service providers to sustainably achieve the shortest lead time, best quality, and value. This book focuses on lean in the context of cloud computing capacity management of applications and the physical and virtual cloud resources that support them. Lean Computing for the Cloud considers business, architectural and operational aspects of efficiently delivering valuable services to end users via cloud-based applications hosted on shared cloud infrastructure. The work also focuses on overall optimization of the service delivery chain to enable both application service and infrastructure service providers to adopt leaner, demand driven operations to serve end users more efficiently.The book's early chapters analyze how capacity management morphs with cloud computing into interlocked physical infrastructure capacity management, virtual resource capacity management, and application capacity management problems. The middle chapters frame cloud capacity management as a lean thinking problem, lay out strategies for applying lean thinking best practices across the cloud service delivery chain, and apply key lean insights from other industries. Later chapters discuss lean reserve capacity, lean demand management, optimal power management, and quantitative performance metrics of lean capacity management, which can be used to methodically drive continuous improvement of lean cloud computing deployments. The final chapter summarizes the book's insights on lean strategies to minimize waste across the cloud computing service delivery chain.

Abstract: Reasons to think about cloud computing. This thesis presents the essential characteristics of cloud computing such as on-demand self-service, broadband access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and the measured service. The study also discusses service delivery models and deployment models, which define how services are delivered to the customer. Cloud computing has security issues just like every computing technology. Because these security problems lie in data transfer and software interfaces, as well as data which has been stored and user access control, they are analyzed in this study. This thesis presents technologies which enable cloud computing such as virtualization and hypervisors that are used to virtualize the servers and which can be used to deploy the services. This thesis was made for a large international IT-company as a part of a customer project. The study presents company products that were used in the project to deliver cost-efficient customer solutions. Cloud computing is a relatively new trend in modern information technology, especially in the constantly evolving Finnish market. This study compares global benefits acquired with cloud computing as well as the effects of this technology to the quality of service and costs. Technologies compared in this study are hypervisors used in server virtualization such as ESXi, KVM, Hyper-V, Xen and PowerVM. Although ESXi hypervisor is the dominant one, it is also more expensive. Open-source- based KVM hypervisor can manage almost the same features but at a significantly lower cost.

Cloud computing is not a particular information technology but a concept/channel of communications, sometimes compared to network services such as providing gas or electricity. Cloud computing, giving an opportunity to use IT infrastructure and tools as a service, not a product, has become one of the most influential tendency in a development of modern IT, being a popular method of outsourcing of IT services for companies and individuals. A paper identifies key regulatory problems presently faced by cloud computing. Then a paper delivers a general overview of existing EU legal provisions that can be applied to cloud computing. The application of current regulations to solving problems resulting from cloud computing is rather limited what was confirmed by an opinion on data protection in cloud computing announced in July 2012 by so called Article 29 Working Party. The further part of a paper brings the analysis of the Commission's initiatives concerning cloud computing. Commission's strategy on cloud computing seeks solutions of many issues related to cloud computing in future (currently under preparation) EU regulations such as so-called General Data Protection Regulation and others. The paper concludes that the EU's regulatory policy on cloud computing should be based on 'soft framework' (unbinding soft law and policy measures) rather than binding regulation..

"Clouds affect our daily weather and play key roles in the global climate. Through their ability to precipitate, clouds provide virtually all of the fresh water on Earth and are a crucial link in the hydrologic cycle. With ever-increasing importance being placed on quantifiable predictions - from forecasting the local weather to anticipating climate change - we must understand how clouds operate in the real atmosphere, where interactions with natural and anthropogenic pollutants are common. This textbook provides students - whether seasoned or new to the atmospheric sciences - with a quantitative yet approachable path to learning the inner workings of clouds. Developed over many years of the authors' teaching at Pennsylvania State University, Physics and Chemistry of Clouds is an invaluable textbook for advanced students in atmospheric science, meteorology, environmental sciences/engineering and atmospheric chemistry. It is also a very useful reference text for researchers and professionals"--

Abstract: Collaborative document management systems. The volume of the electronic documents that the company nowadays has to manage is high. Therefore the systematic document management has a significant role in company's working process. The Internet has enabled that the software can be acquired as a service that operates in a cloud environment. In that case the company has the use of the software and pays only for the use. This study gathered the requirements for the cloud based documentation management system. The purpose of the study was to document both functional and business requirements for the document management system and present some existing cloud based document management systems and their features. The technical documentation of the customer company's current document management system was studied and project participants were interviewed. The initial assumption for the project was to find out, if the cloud based document management system could replace the existing system. As a result of the study the features of the customer company's current documentation management system were listed. These features among other things are storing the documents into the database, configuring the metadata and its structure, handling the documents' versions, versatile search functions, documents encryption, previewing of the documents, commenting, and the mass transfer of the documents. The business requirements for the system are that it is scalable and it supports work sharing between project participants. Also the setup and the usage of the system must be efficient. The costs for the document management system can be estimated with the information of user volumes, disk quota, and the data traffic. When comparing the features of the existing cloud based systems, it was found out that none of the systems did meet all of the requirements. The study works as a basis for the migration to the new cloud based document management system.

Anite Finland Ltd. is a Finnish based company providing a full range of software and hardware solutions for the mobile network testing. The Nemo product portfolio consists of several products from handheld measurement tools all the way to the powerful data analysing server solutions. The main customers are mobile operators all around the world. Anti-piracy and copy protecting is a serious business, as there are skilful people trying to break the copy protections for illegal income or to gain reputation among the hacker scene. This is where the well-functioning licensing tool comes to question. In this document, licensing is a synonym for copy protection. Regarding the mobile device products, it was decided that the previous licensing method was outdated and was not flexible enough for use of today. There was a serious need for a faster and more efficient way of creating multiple licenses. When having classified data, it is mandatory to have it encrypted. There are several ways of encrypting the data but some algorithms have gained reputation over others. There are two main categories in data encryption; symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In the symmetric encryption, the same key is used for data encryption and for decryption. The most common symmetric encryption algorithm today is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which utilizes Rijndael-algorithm. In the asymmetric encryption, there are two different keys called the private key and the public key. One key is used for encryption and the other key is used for decryption. One of the most well performing asymmetric encryption algorithms is the RSA. Cloud services and cloud computing are making their way to the everyday use in the software development business. All major service providers, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon are providing their own solutions for each cloud computing service layers. The “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) -layer is an effective combination of outsourced computing power with a rather flexible software development environment. The Google App Engine is Google’s version of PaaS, and it is available for free and it offers development tools for Python, Java, PHP and Go.
"Clouds contribute to the environment in many ways. Clouds, through a variety of physical processes acting over many spatial scales, provide both liquid and solid forms of precipitation and nature's only significant source of fresh water. Under extreme circumstances, however, clouds and precipitation may not form at all, leading to prolonged droughts in some regions. At other times and places, too much rain or snow falls, giving rise to devastating floods or blizzards. Liquid rain drops bring usable water directly to the surface, while simultaneously carrying many trace chemicals out of the atmosphere and into the ecosystems of the Earth. Chemical wet deposition thereby supplies nutrients (and sometimes toxic compounds) to both terrestrial and aquatic lifeforms, as well as the weak acids responsible for the weathering of the Earth's crust. The solid forms of precipitation contribute in additional ways to the world as we know it. Snow, for instance, forms the winter snowpacks that dramatically affect the radiation balance and climate of high latitudes on a seasonal basis"--
