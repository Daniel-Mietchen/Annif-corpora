Counter The human footprint on the global environment now touches every corner of the world. This book explores the myriad ways that environmental archives can be used to study the distribution and long-term trajectories of chemical contaminants. The volume first focuses on reviews that examine the integrity of the historic record, including factors related to hydrology, post-depositional diffusion, and mixing processes. This is followed by a series of chapters dealing with the diverse archives and methodologies available for long-term studies of environmental pollution, such as the use of sediments, ice cores, sclerochronology, and museum specimens.

Quantitative ecotoxicology
"Gonorrhea. Bed bugs. Weeds. Salamanders. People. All are evolving, some surprisingly rapidly, in response to our chemical age. In Unnatural Selection, Emily Monosson shows how our drugs, pesticides, and pollution are exerting intense selection pressure on all manner of species. And we humans might not like the result. Monosson reveals that the very code of life is more fluid than once imagined. When our powerful chemicals put the pressure on to evolve or die, beneficial traits can sweep rapidly through a population. Species with explosive population growth - the bugs, bacteria, and weeds - tend to thrive, while bigger, slower-to-reproduce creatures, like ourselves, are more likely to succumb. Monosson explores contemporary evolution in all its guises. She examines the species that we are actively trying to beat back, from agricultural pests to life-threatening bacteria, and those that are collateral damage - creatures struggling to adapt to a polluted world. Monosson also presents cutting-edge science on gene expression, showing how environmental stressors are leaving their mark on plants, animals, and possibly humans for generations to come. Unnatural Selection is eye-opening and more than a little disquieting. But it also suggests how we might lessen our impact: manage pests without creating super bugs; protect individuals from disease without inviting epidemics; and benefit from technology without threatening the health of our children."--

"Many books have now been published in the broad field of environmental toxicology. However, to date, none of have presented the often fascinating stories of the wildlife science, and the steps along the way from discovery of problems caused by environmental pollutants to the regulatory and non-regulatory efforts to address the problems. This book provides case by case examinations of how toxic chemical effects on wildlife have brought about policy and regulatory decisions, and positive changes in environmental conditions. Wild animal stories, whether they are about the disappearance of charismatic top predators, or of grossly deformed embryos or frogs, provide powerful symbols that can and have captured the public's imagination and have resulted in increased awareness by decision makers. It is the intent of this book to present factual and balanced overviews and summaries of the science and the subsequent regulatory processes that followed to effect change (or not). A variety of chemicals and topics are covered, from the impact of legacy pollutants such as dioxins and PCBs in birds to controversial issues of herbicides and amphibians, and the recent case of the veterinarian pharmaceutical that has brought three species of Asian vultures to the brink of extinction. Researchers, regulators, educators, NGOs and the general public will find valuable insights into the processes and mechanisms involved both in environmental scientific investigation and in efforts to effect positive change"--Back cover.

"During the latter part of the 20th century chemical industry grew rapidly, and with this growth new industrial chemicals found their way into the natural environment. Pesticides came to be used on a larger scale, and questions were asked about residues of them that were found in environmental samples (biota, soil, water, and air). Residues were also found of a range of industrial chemicals in effluents entering rivers and polluted air. Some of these events received extensive media coverage, which was something of a mixed blessing. While important discoveries were made known to a wide audience, inaccuracies and half-truths crept into this reportage, sometimes leaving a rather confusing impression to interested laypeople. In time, government laboratories, industrial laboratories, and universities became involved in the investigation of pollution problems, and the discipline of ecotoxicology began to take shape. Today ecotoxicology courses are offered by universities and colleges of further education. While a number of textbooks are now available to students who follow ecotoxicology courses at universities and other institutions of higher education, there appears to be a shortage of texts aimed at interested laypeople. This seems unfortunate, because the science underlying environmental pollution has intriguing aspects to it. There is much evidence for the phenomenon of chemical warfare in nature, which, over a long period, has been a driving force in the evolution of plant toxins and the production by animals of systems that detoxify them. The selective pressure of pesticides has led to the evolution of resistant strains of pests. The biomagnification of recalcitrant organic pollutants in food chains has raised problems for predators of higher"--
