Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is one of the important fruit crops in arid land. The conservation of date palm genetic diversity is thus an important task to maintain the genetic resources. In order to identify salinity tolerant date palms, evaluation of four varieties was conducted based on analysis of morphological and physiological parameters, e.g. growth and pigment analysis, respectively. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was employed to characterize the varieties. The varieties were irrigated with increasing concentrations of saline water from 7.8, 11.7, 15.6, 19.5, 23.4 and 27.3 dS/m at regular intervals of three months duration. The growth parameters were plant height, collar girth and number of leaves. The physiological parameters were the types and quantities of the photosynthetic pigments. The varieties responded differentially to the increasing salt concentration with Bugal White acquiring maximum plant height, collar girth and production of leaves. The sensitivity to high salinity recorded reduced growth, leaf production and collar girth in varieties Mesalli and Razez. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of the treated varieties were highest in the varieties Bugal White and Khashkar and significantly superior to Mesalli and Razez. The date palm varieties were fingerprinted using fourteen random primers to detect the DNA polymorphism. Primer OPC-02 revealed a 1400 bp fragment amplified in 'Bugal White' (salinity tolerant) and 'Khlas' which is known to be drought tolerant. Primer OPD-02 distinguished 'Bugal White', which proved to be salinity tolerant, with a DNA fragment of about 1200 bp. Primer OPD-02 amplified a 1600 bp fragment in 'Khashkar', 'Bugal White', 'Shaham' and 'Khlas'.

The poorly understood mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication has traditionally been studied in mammals and the former theories have been argued and questioned quite recently. Dr. Priit Joers, from the University of Tampere, at the Institute of Medical Technology started a research project to study the mtDNA replication of Drosophila melanogaster because no published data on the matter exists at the moment. The object of the development project was to participate in the research project of Dr. Joers. The development project concentrated on the methodology of two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (2D-AGE) which is used in studying the mtDNA replication.     In this development project two similar experiments were performed. The thesis focused on the second one which was performed independently by the student. Samples of mtDNA extracted from Drosophila melanogaster were digested with restriction enzymes Nde I, Bsp 1407 I, Xho and EcoRV. Duplicates of each sample were treated with single-strand-specific nuclease (S1 nuclease) to remove single-stranded regions. With these modifications different replication intermediates were produced to study the replication. The replication intermediates were separated by using a ready optimized 2D-AGE. Visualization of the 2D-gels was done by Southern hybridization using radiolabels. The full analysis of the pictures was done by Dr. Joers.    The technical quality of the results was good and valid data for the research project of Dr. Joers was produced. Single-strand-specific nuclease sensitive regions were found in the replicating mtDNA. New data of the mtDNA replication was discovered, but these facts need to be studied further.

Massive data acquisition technologies, such as genome sequencing, high-throughput drug screening, and DNA arrays are in the process of revolutionizing biology and medicine. Using the mRNA of a given cell, at a given time, under a given set of conditions, DNA microarrays can provide a snapshot of the level of expression of all the genes in the cell. Such snapshots can be used to study fundamental biological phenomena such as development or evolution, to determine the function of new genes, to infer the role individual genes or groups of genes may play in diseases, and to monitor the effect of drugs and other compounds on gene expression. Originally published in 2002, this inter-disciplinary introduction to DNA arrays will be of value to anyone with an a interest in this powerful technology.
Apoptosis, cellular division or mitotic catastrophe? : effects of kinase inhibition and DNa damage in lung cancer cells
"In The Disappearing Spoon, bestselling author Sam Kean unlocked the mysteries of the periodic table. In THE VIOLINIST'S THUMB, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA. There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK's bronze skin (it wasn't a tan) to Einstein's genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists. Kean's vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species' future"--

Recent developments in sequencing methods have enabled whole genome sequencing of several species and the available sequence information has allowed the development of high throughput genotyping chips. However, these genotyping methods require high quality DNA. The possibility to genotype samples based on DNA from non-invasive sources would permit retrospective genotyping of previously collected samples and also facilitate the analysis of large populations e.g. for genomic selection. In this study we have developed and evaluated different DNA preparation methods from porcine hair root follicles for high throughput genotyping with the PorcineSNP60 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We describe a method for DNA extraction from porcine hair root samples, which produces results from high throughput genotyping with the same high degree of accuracy as previously reported for DNA extracted from sperm, blood or tissue samples. This method was used for the genotyping of 273 hair follicle samples. When the DNA concentration was > 30 ng/Âµl all samples had the same high call rate ( > 99%) as sperm samples confirming the robustness of this DNA extraction method for high throughput genotyping. Our data also establishes the suitability of the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip for genotyping the Finnish Landrace population.

As the Human Genome Project completed its mapping of the entire human genome, hopes ran high that we would rapidly be able to use our knowledge of human genes to tackle many inherited diseases, and understand what makes us unique among animals. But things didn't turn out that way ... but the emerging picture is if anything far more exciting. Parrington gives an outline of the deeper genome, involving layers of regulatory elements controlling and coordinating the switching on and off of genes; the impact of its 3D geometry; the discovery of a variety of new RNAs playing critical roles; the epigenetic changes influenced by the environment and life experiences that can make identical twins different and be passed on to the next generation; and the clues coming out of comparisons with the genomes of Neanderthals as well as that of chimps about the development of our species.

Microarray technology has made strong progress over the past decade, and there have also been significant changes in application areas, from nucleic acids to proteomics and from research to clinical applications. This book provides a comprehensive overview of microarrays in diagnostics and biomarker development, covering DNA, peptide, protein and tissue arrays. The focus is on entities that are in actual clinical use, or quite close, and on recent developments, such as peptide and aptamer arrays. A further topic is the miniaturisation towards ânanoarraysâ, which is expected to have great potential in clinical applications. Relevant issues of bioinformatics and statistical analysis of array data are discussed in detail, as well as the barriers to the commercialisation of array-based tests and the vexing IP issues involved. Thus, the book should be very useful tor active array users as well as to newcomers seeking to make the best choice between different technologies.

Human Chromosome Variation: Heteromorphism and Polymorphism was formerly printed under the title âAtlas of Human Chromosome Heteromorphismâ. The Atlas has become a standard reference book in most cytogenetic laboratories and is cited as a significant reference in ISCN 2009. This revised version has updated and retained the most useful pictorial sections of the first edition, including the comprehensive review of normal and ânot-so-normalâ variations of the human karyotype with summaries and extensive reference lists organized by chromosome number. This updated edition features concise background information on chromosome methods and applications, essential information on heteromorphism frequencies in normal and clinical populations as well as new listing and discussions of euchromatic, subtelomeric and FISH variants. The addition of two new sections make this an even more valuable reference than before. A section on common and rare fragile sites includes a short historical discussion, definitions and an extensive table of officially recognized sites that includes the HUGO name, chromosomal location, methods of induction, genes and references to the most recent molecular characterization. A new section on array CGH discusses the clinical challenge of interpreting copy number variations (CNVs) revealed by this newest technology, gives examples of various levels of interpretation and lists the several most common websites used in this interpretation.
The amount and extractability of DNA in different parts of MON810 GM hybrid was studied during different developmental stages. To quantify GM contents, an evaluation was performed of the effect of plant development stage on DNA density. To this end, the evolution of weights, absolute DNA yields, DNA densities and ratios of endosperm and embryo relative to total maize kernel were studied. Sampling at four stages during the growth shows an influence on relative GM quantification based on haploid genome equivalents, due to the specific maize seed composition and differences in DNA extractability from different seed tissues. During plant growth, plant parts with potential GM genes (embryo in kernel and cob on total plant) increase in importance on weight and DNA concentration level, while the endosperm drops in relative importance. Expected % GM maize values are calculated for a whole field harvest of grain maize.
