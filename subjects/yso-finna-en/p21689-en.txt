This is an introductory text on mental health and deafness for care workers and mental health workers, both those familiar with deaf people but not with mental health and those familiar with mental health but not with deaf people. It covers a wide range of mental health issues as they relate to deafness and is divided into two sections. The first, Assessment, includes topics ranging from child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry, children who are deaf and have multiple disabilities, addictive behaviour and deafness, to maltreatment of deaf children. The second section, Management and Intervention, discusses interpreters in mental health settings, educational interventions, family therapy and drug treatments. The contributors to this book, some of who are deaf themselves, come from a range of professional disciplines and are international experts in their fields.

This book provides a model for adapting best practices in cognitive-behavioral therapy to consumers whose language and cognitive deficits make it difficult for them to benefit from traditional talk oriented psychotherapy. The book focuses primarily upon the mental health care of those deaf clients, sometimes referred to as "low functioning" or "traditionally underserved," who are particularly difficult to engage in meaningful treatment. Drawing most heavily upon the work of Donald Meichenbaum, Marsha Linehan and Ross Greene, this book presents adaptations and simplifications of psychotherapy which make it accessible and meaningful for persons often viewed as "poor candidates." The heart of the book is a greatly simplified approach to psychosocial skill training, especially in the domains of coping, conflict resolution and relapse prevention skills, as well as an extensive discussion of "pre-treatment" strategies for engaging clients in mental health care. Also included is research demonstrating how deaf mental health clients are different than hearing clients, guidelines for doing mental status examinations with deaf clients whose language dysfluency gives them the false appearance of having thought disorders, and a chapter on developing staff and creating culturally and clinically appropriate treatment programs. Included with the book is a CD-ROM containing over 1500 beautifully drawn illustrations of a wide range of mental health and substance abuse related concepts. These pictures or "skill cards" are used in psychoeducation and therapy with persons who can not read English.

This book can help in exploring the role of physical activity in mental health and well-being. With contributions from internationally renowned experts, Physical Activity and Mental Health presents defining research on how the use of physical activity can enhance well-being and reduce the impact of potentially debilitating mental health conditions. Physical Activity and Mental Health details the factors that influence the relationship between mental health and physical activity as well as the benefits of physical activity in dealing with mental illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia and addictive behaviours. Exercise readiness checklists, mental health checklists and population-specific sample activity plans assist in creating and implementing exercise programmes to meet the needs of patients or clients.

Mental health social work : evidence-based practice
The Welfare of Children with Mentally Ill Parents examines the interventions made by professional workers from a range of different disciplines in families with dependent children and a mentally ill parent. The authors compare responses of professionals in ten European countries and one state in Australia. The analysis of the differences sheds new light on both the inherent and system-determined difficulties in helping families to manage their situation effectively. Features the only comparative study of mental health social services and the law governing compulsory hospital admission Covers a current "hot-button" topic that is growing in importance as the impact of social policy developments on children over time becomes more apparent Offers a unique perspective due to the focus on the impact of children of mentally ill parents and the international systems that deal with child protection.
