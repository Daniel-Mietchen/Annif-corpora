UPM-Kymmene Oyj is one of the world's leading paper industry companies. The purpose of this thesis was to create container optimizing tool for UPM customer service. Background of the thesis was to develop way of working in the order creation phase and accomplish cost-efficiency by optimizing container payloads. Cost-efficiency means finding correct order amounts and maximizing sea containers capacity.  Thesis focuses how orders are created in customer service and its needs to optimizing order amounts. In addition ground rules and initial data concerning optimization process were defined during this the thesis work. Source data were found from UPMs internal systems and from ISO-standards. Many development points were found in the middle of the tool creation and in test phase.  Thesis includes history of the containers and it shows how container markets have been increased to ease understanding how important fully usage of container capacities. Thesis describes all the way of container order process from order creation to customer delivery.
