Interprofessional and International Learning Experiences in Social and Health Care Higher Education in Lahti University of Applied Sciences
Art school is at a point of unprecedented popularity both as an enterprise and as an object of critical inquiry. This book examines the complex and often unruly state of art education by focusing on its signature pedagogical form, the assignment. Practical and quixotic in equal parts, the art assignment can resemble a riddle as much as a recipe, and often sounds more like a haiku, or even a joke, than a clear directive. From introductory exercises in perspective drawing to graduate-level experiments in societal transformation, the assignment coalesces ideas about what art is, how it should be taught, and what larger purpose it might, or might not, serve. The book is a written record of an evolving oral tradition. Bringing together hundreds of assignments, anti-assignments, and artworks from both teachers and students from a broad range of institutions, we hope it simultaneously serves as an archive and an instigation, a teaching tool and a question mark, a critique and a tribute.

Children's achievement behaviors in relation to their skill development and temperament
Practitioners in informal science settings--museums, after-school programs, science and technology centers, media enterprises, aquariums, zoos, and botanical gardens--are interested in finding out what learning looks like, how to measure it, and what they can do to ensure that people of all ages, from different backgrounds and cultures, have a positive learning experience. Surrounded by Science: Learning Science in Informal Environments, is designed to make that task easier. Based on the National Research Council study, Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits, this book is a tool that provides case studies, illustrative examples, and probing questions for practitioners. In short, this book makes valuable research accessible to those working in informal science: educators, museum professionals, university faculty, youth leaders, media specialists, publishers, broadcast journalists, and many others.

Effects of intervention on psychosocial functioning of hearing and hard of hearing children in selected primary schools of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
This study investigates young children's views of successful learning situations in their classroom activities and factors that contribute to their achievement in those situations. It is investigated how self-regulated learning is supported in these situations and how children appraise support as part of their success.The study consists of three different data sets that are reported in three empirical articles. The first empirical study investigated resilience displayed by young children in dyadic task performance. The second empirical study investigated views and appraisals that primary school children give to their success in classroom learning activities and how self-regulated learning is supported in the classrooms. The third empirical study investigated how primary school children appraise the reasons for their peers' successes in learning situations. The data collection methods include video observations, stimulated recall interviews and photo elicitation interviews.The results of this dissertation indicated that success in learning activities results from individual and external factors. Among the individual assets that children bring to learning situations, the support that children receive from their teachers and peers were crucial for successful achievement. This study showed that, in general, the children's self-regulated learning was supported in the classroom, especially through the support from a teacher and non-threatening evaluation. Children described their success through concrete actions that they took in the situations, such as the ability to accomplish the particular tasks or doing academic activities in order to achieve the task. The methodological findings indicate that it is possible to develop child-centred participatory methods in learning research. Results of this study contribute to the discussion of how successful learning experiences andself-regulated learning can be supported in the first years of primary school.

Effects of authentic learning and e-learning in an introductory chemistry laboratory course
In Finland, online learning has become more common in recent years. In this study, we examined why adult students chose to study online for upper secondary school. The research also focused on the support needed for learning from a special education perspective. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected using an electronic questionnaire. In total, 58 students responded. Data were analyzed qualitatively using the content analysis technique. The findings indicate that the main reasons for online studies are similar in Finland to those found internationally: flexibility of timetables, the student's health condition, and family situations. The findings also indicate that a student's school history leads them to choose online studies. This history included a lack of support, health issues, bullying, and too large class size. Suggested future research and practical implications also are discussed.

Associations between age and cognitive foundation skills in the Nordic countries : a closer look at the data
"Many contemporary concerns in higher education focus on the student experience of learning, battling with the dual concerns of a larger and much more diverse intake than ever before and the limitation of funding; questions are being asked afresh around the purposes of higher education. As much as the central questions in higher education focus on student enrolment in programmes, student retention, progression and success, graduate fitness for work, the actual student tends to be absent in so much of this rhetoric and even scholarly literature. The central questions are then of grading, selection, conversion and efficiency but these analyses have not really yielded much apart from providing some indication that the system is hugely inefficient. This book turns this conversation on its head, by inserting a full consideration of student participation into the context of higher education. Working sociologically, it explores the influence of the social context on what the individual student achieves. It utilises a social realist approach to researching student learning, illustrating its potential value by a detailed exploration of student learning within one particular discipline: engineering education "--

Education students' experiences of learning and their conceptions about learning disabilities : towards a comprehensive theory of learning
Learning games and children's user experience : the effects of context
"This book examines Japanese cultural beliefs about disability and related socialization practices as they impact the experiences of elementary school-aged children. Physical and mental conditions which impair children's functioning are universal issues impacting child welfare and educational systems around the world. While the American approach is well understood and represented in the literature, cultures differ in which physical and mental conditions are considered 'disabling'. Currently, the Japanese educational system is in transition as public schools implement formal special education services for children with developmental disabilities. 'Developmental disabilities' is a new term used by Japanese educators to categorize a variety of relatively minor social and cognitive conditions caused by neurologically based deficits: learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and Asperger's Syndrome. Children who were once considered 'difficult' or 'slow learners' are now considered to be 'disabled' and in need of special services. This transition created an excellent opportunity to explore Japanese beliefs about disability that might otherwise have remained unexamined by participants, and how these evolving beliefs and new socialization and educational practices impact children's experiences"--
