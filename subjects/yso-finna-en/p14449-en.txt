This is a product-oriented thesis and its goal was to create a user guide that can be used by the employees of the German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce when they work with the applicant management system jobXchange. The German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce is part of the worldwide network of German Chambers of CommerceAbroad and is based in Helsinki, Finland. The user guide is designed to help both older  and newer employees to get familiar with the system and to give guidelines in case questions arise. This user guide is meant to be a concise explanation of everything that needs to be known about jobXchange. The theoretical part of this thesis examines recruitment and the employment cycle. In addition, different sources of recruitment, recruitment policies and the major differences between recruitment in Germany and Finland are explained. Background information about the jobXchange applicant management system is also provided. The user guide consists of several parts. First the Chamber of Commerce is introduced, as well as some background information about jobXchange and what it actually is. Afterwards, the various services of jobXchange are explained in detail and instructions on how they are carried out are provided, both in text and graphical form. In the end recommendations on the promotion of jobXchange are given, as are ways to enhance its presence on the Chamber of Commerce's website. This could be done, for example, by introducing the system to the chamber's member companies and using their social media accounts to reach more potential applicants and companies that might be interested in using jobXchange. In addition, the information regarding jobXchange on the chamber's website should be revised to make it more clear and concise. An employee who is solely responsible for jobXchange should also be hired in order to help improve efficiency.
