Introduction to stochastic process
This self-contained monograph focuses on recent important developments in the study of random fields, stochastic processes defined over high dimensional parameter spaces. While it replaces Adler's 1981 classic, "The Geometry of Random Fields", this is not an update, but a completely new work with a completely new way of handling both the geometry and the probability that are its central themes.There are three quite distinct parts to the monograph. Part I provides a comprehensive background to the general theory of Gaussian random fields, treating classical topics such as continuity and boundedness, entropy and majorising measures, Borell and Slepian inequalities. The treatment is didactic and user-friendly. Part II is about Geometry, both integral and Riemannian, and the material included here is what is needed for the over-riding probabilistic theme of the book. It contains a quick review of both these geometric settings, followed by carefully presented introductions to topics such as Crofton formulae, curvature measures for stratified manifolds, critical point theory and tube formulae. This is the only place in which all these topics, necessary for the study of random fields can be found in a concise, self-contained, treatment. The most important part of the book is in Part III, which is about the geometry of excursion sets of random fields and the related - Euler characteristic approach - to extremal probabilities. This part contains path-breaking material of both theoretical and practical importance and is unique in the way in which it intertwines probabilistic and geometric problems. Applications of this theory, which are significant and cover areas as widespread as brain imaging, physical oceanography and astrophysics, will be treated in a separate volume with Keith Worsley. This monograph will be of interest to probabilists and statisticians, both applied and theoretical, along with mathematicians interested in learning about new relationships between geometry and probability. It is also a basic reference text for those who will eventually be interested mainly in the companion volume of applications. Given the clear and pedagogical style of the book and the current importance of research in random fields, this comprehensive and definitive work will serve as an indispensable reference work, while at the same time being an excellent text for self study and graduate courses in probability, statistics, analysis and geometry.

The goal of the thesis is to study and develop business processes in a financial services company. The commissioner of the work is the Monetra Oy in Oulu. In the first phase the current state of processes is examined based on interviews of the key people in the company. At the starting point, the main key processes are identified based on services each team in the company provides to customers. In the second phase the analysis is conducted and the improvement areas are identified, in both processes and management methods for process development. The theoretical foundation presents concepts and methodologies relevant to reasoning of the documentation work, process description techniques, consideration of particular characteristics of people centric processes and finally process improvement practices. In the results section the execution of the work is explained and the findings of the analysis are introduced. The result is a documentation of business processes assigned for the study, and an analysis report with a collection of recommendations for future development actions.

The use of digital services today has become more and more common. There is a huge amount of information available about products, services and companies for consumers and thus they have become more critical towards information they are offered. Understanding customer need has become more essential when companies have begun to invest in online services. When companies start to put effort on improving online services, their functionality, navigation and information output, customers can have more complete service experience. Me2we Finland Ltd. focuses on project management through crowdsourcing and is the case company in this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was to illustrate Me2we Finland Ltd.’s customer service path and bring out critical points from student-customer perspective by using service design methods. The service path in this context means the steps the customer makes during the service experience, covering the entire process. The use of digital services has become a big part of service industry and it is used in this thesis as a way of utilizing the web site. The platform is used as the only option for customer service in the service process. Customer journey and customer perspective was visualized by utilizing service design methods, such as customer journey and service blueprint and value proposition. Alongside of these methods, business model canvas was used to finding out case company’s current status. The methods used created a description of steps the customer takes while using the service. These steps were arranged through touchpoints, which include the interaction between the customer, platform and company. A workshop was organized for going through the customer journey with potential customers and for clarifying their viewpoint. This thesis followed a five-stage service design process and involved customer viewpoint in order to improve platform’s usage. It can be concluded that describing the digital service path and adding company’s processes enable presenting the path visually and its critical steps in an easy format. Customer participation in the development process was involved through a workshop, then analyzed by observing. The service phases can be presented internally in the company to evaluate and improve the phases to incorporate them as a visible part of company operations. Service design basically enables customer to have more information available and thus might reduce the need for customization and personal guidance of service. The researcher realized that every touchpoint of the service path has risks. Customer journey and service blueprint revealed few critical points that effect on the success of the whole service process.

The harmonization of the Tolerance analysis calculation tool was carried out for a global company that operates in telecommunication base station industry, to be used in Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. The author works for the client companys Electromechanics maintenance organization and in close cooperation with the research and development organization. The target of the thesis work was to develop and implement a tool for the analysis of the mechanical tolerance stack-ups, to be used in the client companys global organizations. The work was completed together with the project team and following the client companys review and approval processes. The back-ground knowledge is based on the employees professional experience in analyzing the tolerance stack-ups, existing tolerance analysis tools features and technical reference books. As a result of the thesis work, a mechanical tolerance stack-up analysis tool was developed and taken in use globally in the client companys Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. User trainings covered 70 % of the mechanical designers in the implementation phase of the tool. Further development of the analysis tool would be beneficial by comparing its features with the existing similar commercial and non-commercial calculation tools. Additionally, a practical measurement trial should be executed that would result to a practical correlation between the statistical analysis and practical dimensions variation.
