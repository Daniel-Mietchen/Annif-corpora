The essays compiled in this volume, written by distinguished experts, present a broad panorama of the most important methodological challenges faced by conceptual history today, as well as some more specific contributions regarding the temporal dimension of certain modern concepts. At a moment when time and concepts - and political concepts in particular - are no longer obvious and taken for granted but have themselves become historical matter, this book does not limit itself to an updating of the state of the art; it also offers very useful lessons for the development of future research into this field.
