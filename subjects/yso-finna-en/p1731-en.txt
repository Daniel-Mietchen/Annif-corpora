Chronicles : on our troubled times
"What is Europe? What are the contents of the concept of Europe? And what defines European identity? Instead of only asking these classical questions, this volume also explores who asks these questions, and who is addressed with such questions. Who answers the questions, from which standpoints and for what reasons? Which philosophical, historical, religious or political traditions influence the answers? This book addresses its task in three parts. The first concentrates on the controversies around the meaning of Europe. The second focuses on the role of the European Union. The third discusses Europe and its relations to different types of otherness, or rather, non-European-ness. The volume produces a complex and plural picture of the concepts, ideas, debates and (ex)changes associated with the concept of Europe, and has a clear significance for today's debates on European identity, Europeanization, and the EU".

Abstract: The objective of this Bachelorʼs Thesis was to develop a guide for the immigrant back-ground students of Myllypuro Upper Secondary School. This guide, “Myllypurosta Ponnistaa Maailmalle”, presents the school areas and rules in a visual form, as well as displays the areas and rules in the Finnish language. The purpose of this guide is to enhance the integration process of immigrant background youth who are new to the Finnish schooling system. This thesis presents the process of making the guide, as well as the theoretical background used in the “Myllypurosta Ponnistaa Maailmalle”- guide. The main theoretical framework used in this guide is integration and empowerment. This guide was compiled in assistance with the students and teachers of the Myllypuro Upper Secondary School. The student guidance counselor as well as the teachers of the preparatory class has assisted in the process. In addition, the students have also voiced their opinions about what aspects should be taken into consideration in the guide. The outcome, the “Myllypurosta Ponnistaa Maailmalle”- guide, was made for distribution in the Myllypuro Upper Secondary School. Due to the fact that integration and empowerment are long processes, it has not been possible to accurately measure the results in such a short time, and therefore we have not been able to test how the objective has been met. The initial reactions from the Myllypuro Upper Secondary School have been positive, and the possibility of using this guide in other Finnish Schools has been discussed

This book looks both backward and forward with regard to the European Union's political strategies towards its neighbouring countries. By bringing together the perspectives of critical geopolitics, policy studies and border studies, it presents a comprehensive review of the European Neighbourhood Policy and how it impacts the ongoing construction of the EU's external frontiers. Is the EU committed to promoting integration in a 'wider' European space, or is a "fortress Europe" emerging where the strengthening of internal cohesion is coupled with the militarisation of its external borders? The book aims to problematize this question by showing how the EU's external policies are based on a mixture of openness and closure, inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and securitisation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a controversial strategy where regionalization and bordering, homogenisations and differentiations, centrifugal and centripetal forces proceed side-by-side, in an explicit attempt to construct a selective, mobile and fragmented border. A specific focus is devoted to the diversity of geo-strategies the EU is pursuing in its neighbouring countries and regions, macro-regional strategies and cross-border cooperation initiatives as new scales of cooperation, and the role of other global players.

This paper examines an economic union where oligopolistic firms produce by skilled and unskilled labor and do R&D by skilled labor. The planner of the union accepts new members to the union, deregulates the product market through anti-trust policy and regulates the labor market through a minimum wage for unskilled labor. Firms and workers lobby the planner for prospective policy. It is shown that in the political equilibrium small unions apply product market deregulation, but large unions labor market deregulation. When an economic union grows, it will replace regulation by deregulation in the labor market.

Eurasian integration : challenges of transcontinental regionalism
In recent years, the relationships of the three Baltic states with the European Union have intensified through a variety of agreements aimed at further developing economic and political relations, and ultimately, integration with the European Union.The most important agreements to date have been the Agreements on Trade and Commercial and Economic Cooperation, the Free Trade Agreement, and more recently, Association Agreements (also known as Europe Agreements). Through these, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have asserted their intentions to become fully integrated with Europe. Compared to current EU members, however, the economic, political and social structures of the Baltics are still in transition.To help them as well as other "Central and Eastern European Countries" or "CEECs" in their preparation for membership, the EU has issued a White Paper on approximation of laws, established the Phare expertise-assistance programme, and given at least some preliminary indications as to the conditions for entry. The Baltics are presently focused on the outcome of the EU's Intergovernmental Conference.By 1998, the IGC must decide on the scope of eastern enlargement and, in particular, designate when and under what terms the Baltics are to be admitted to the EU. The European Union's unwillingness to specify conditions and dates for possible membership has become a matter of contention as the Baltic states have continuously insisted on exact dates for their admission.Further, the EU still prefers to deal with the Baltics as a single entity, while the Baltics themselves wish to be treated individually on their own merits.Quite evidently the matter will continue to hang in the air until the EU has reviewed the consequences of eastern enlargement and taken decisions on special admission criteria. Keywords: Baltic countries, enlargement, EU, integration .

Impacts of capacity remunerative mechanisms on cross-border trade
The end of state socialism in central and eastern Europe has opened up the opportunity to integrate western European countries with the former centrally planned economies.Besides the historical peculiarity of enlarging the European Union to the east, a comparison with the earlier southern enlargement comprising Greece, Portugal and Spain gives important insights into mechanisms and problems of geographically extending the Union.Aim of this paper is to explore the past experience of enlarging the EU referring to the economic situation of the applicants in comparison to the member countries and to the challenges to enlargement.In the knowledge of differences, lessons can be drawn from the southern enlargement for the upcoming enlargement towards the east. Keywords: EU enlargements, transition countries .

The new Germany and the new Europe
Up to the end of 1991, more than 90 % of Baltic trade was conducted with other parts of the Soviet Union, where trade was organized not on the basis of voluntary exchange but strictly guided by Moscow.The subsequent collapse of central planning caused widespread disruption in trade and financial links. Nevertheless, the Baltic countries, to a certain extent, retained their strong dependence on trade with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, and as a result saw their terms of trade decrease by 10-15 % of GDP.Further, they experienced high inflation, dramatic output declines, shortages of goods and raw materials, and dysfunctional payment and monetary arrangements.To correct this situation and avoid prolonged economic difficulties, Baltic trade links with the West were restored, as well as economic relations among the Baltic nations themselves. From the trade policy point of view, Estonia followed the most liberal course by eliminating trade restrictions altogether. Latvia and Lithuania have favoured more protectionist policies. Estonia and Latvia have consistently strived to boost their trade with the West, while Lithuania still maintains stronger trade relations with Russia. Despite the fact that the Baltic countries have a free trade agreement and numerous actions have been taken to promote intra-Baltic trade links, current problems at macro- and microeconomic level as well as trade policy differences constitute major obstacles to trade creation and greater cooperation among the Baltic states.Further, the smallness of the Baltic market and the general sameness of tradeable products tend to limit the possibilities for intraregional trade.As a consequence, growth in intraregional trade has remained quite modest. Keywords: foreign trade, integration, Baltic countries .

Abstract: EU single market : the evolution of the European single market. The purpose of this study paper was to define what is the EU Single Market in theory, how it began and to compare it with the current reality. Problems achieving political objectives in the 1990s. Also, what it has turned into today i.e. the EU's enlargements 2004 and 2007 to 27. Demographics and what kind of economic convergence takes place in new member states. The methodology used in this study was qualitative. They consisted of both source books and newspaper articles, and the internet news agencies e.g. Financial Times, Telegraph, and web sources of the European Commission. The results revealed that the Union has many issues and failures. It is also clear that stability is difficult to maintain as many factors influence the situation of the Union e.g. different economies of the member states in the South and North, convergence issues. GDP is not a perfect measurement to see what is going on because even if the GDP is high it may not mean that a state is wealthy. The conclusion of the study was that the EU is a political union. Its enlargement is hard to understand as the criteria used to assess eligibility of a state are very subjective. The contemporary issues with such member states as Latvia, Greece, Ireland, Spain and Estonia joining Euro currency as an example of success while other states struggle make the EU look very political union rather than economic one.
The next mediterranean enlargement of the European Community : Turkey, Cyprus and Malta?
This paper examines possible effects of EU membership and the shift to the euro on the monetary and exchange rate policies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.The Baltics, which have extensive economic integration with euro-area states, all apply monetary policies based on fixed exchange rates.Estonias kroon is pegged directly to the euro.The external value of the Latvian lats is determined by a currency basket with a heavy euro weighting.Lithuania is currently shifting its peg of the litas from the US-dollar to a euro-dominated basket.The switch to the euro as the Baltics anchor currency has compelling practical reasons.Euro-area countries now provide a significant share of foreign direct investment into the Baltics and they collectively comprise the Baltics largest trading partner.The Baltic financial sectors are also extensively integrated with the euro area.Finally, the Baltic economies are natural candidates for fixed exchange rates, due to their small size and openness.Nevertheless, fixed exchange rate regimes always involve risks.Two of the biggest challenges facing the Baltic states are finding ways to keep productivity growth in line with real wage growth and increasing the flexibility of labor markets. .

European culture and the media : changing media, changing Europe
This study looks at the interplay between European Monetary Union (EMU) and a future EU enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe. The country focus is on the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.The analysis concludes that EMU is improving the framework conditions for a future Eastern enlargement. Moreover, EMU in itself is becoming ever more relevant to the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe: The introduction of the euro and these countries' subsequent accession to the EU will alter their monetary and exchange rate policy frameworks.The EMU convergence criteria will not play a major role in the EU accession process.However, in the preaccession period, they should be viewed as medium- and longer-term points of reference for stability-oriented economic policymaking. .

Since regaining independence, Estonian has carried out its economic and political reforms with dispatch and determination.Estonia has now succesfully completed primary tasks faced by most transition countries, ie. trade liberalization, macroeconomic stabilization, privatization, monetary reform, strengthening of financial sector etc.One of the main challanges presently facing Estonia is the EU membership.If Estonia intends to become a member of the EU in the years ahead, EMU will comprise the framework of development also for the Estonian economy.What then are the implications of EMU memberhip for Estonia ?Benefits include elimination of currency transaction costs, reduction of costs of hedging against exchange rate risk, increased competition due to price transparency, increased foreign trade, elimination of problems related to fluctuating exchange rates, low inflation, and benefits related to increased international role of the common European currency euro. Costs related the EMU and a common currency depend on the structure of Estonia's economy vis a vis other European economies.In general, if EMU member states have similar economic structures and economic problems, then the costs will be low, because a common EMU economic policy suit every country's individual needs.If this is not the case, then the costs of a common currency will be high.  Estonia's participation in euro area requires a fulfilment of the Maastricht convergnece criteria on interest rate, exchange rate, price stability as well as public debt.In respect of the government deficit and debt, succesfull economic reform and accompanying economic growth have created a situation wherein Estonia's debt burden is relatively small and the Estonian government can easily borrow money from international markets. Regarding to price stability, inflation rate in Estonia is still considerably above the level of Western European countries.Also, long-term interest rates still exceed the reference value of the EMU criterion.Finally, the criterion of exchange rate stability can be considered to be essentially fulfilled in Estonia because the kroon has already for five years been pegged to the Deutschemark, one of the most stable currencies in Europe.  If Estonia remains outside the official euro area after accession, the EMU will still have an enormous impact on its economic and monetary policies.For Estonia, as well as for all new member states, the pursuit of strict macroeconomic and fiscal policies is of essential importance.  Keywords:Estonia, EMU, EU, integration, enlargement, monetary policy .
The paper estimates the Monetary Condition Indices (MCIs) for three EU accession countries: the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia and assesses the relative importance of interest rates and of the exchange rate in the transmission of monetary policy.The calculated MCI ratios indicate that the exchange rate has surprisingly little influence on the Slovakian economy.The MCI ratio for the Czech Republic is very much comparable to that of small EU countries.Poland seems to be extremely sensitive to changes in the exchange rate.However, estimations appear to be quite sensitive to different specifications, and therefore should be treated with caution. Key words: Monetary policy, Monetary Condition Index, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia .

Since the Copenhagen and Essen Summits in June 1993 and December 1994, there has been a consensus on eastern enlargement.Central and Eastern European countries have been shown the green light in terms of accession.However, questions of when and how remain open for discussion.The main elements of the accession strategy appear in the Europe Agreements on economic cooperation, the White Paper on approximation of laws, the Phare programme of economic aid to the associated countries and structured dialogue.  At the moment, the aspirant members are not ready to take on the complex set of rules ranging from minimum social and environmental standards in the single market to the application of competition law.  In respect to transition development, markets already finction reasonably well in most CEECs.However, in several areas of economic activity, effective and transparent corporate governance and appropriate standards for conducting business still have a long way to go.This applies, in particular, to enterprise restructuring, strengthening of financial institutions, commercialisation of infrastructure and environmental protection. Furthermore, many changes in legal structures are still required. Regrading to macroeconomic stabilisation, progress towards stability continues, growth remains relatively strong and inflation has declined.Nevertheless, increasing trade deficits, real exchange rate appreciation and signs of a deterioration in international competitiveness may lower growth.In addition, expectations concerning wage increases, further liberalisation of administered prices, money supply growth caused by high interest rates, and growth of credits to enterprises are to fuell inflation in the future.  From the EU's point of view, the official framework for admission to the EU involves, among others, the Commission preparing an opinion (avis) on the applicant's ability to acceppt the body of EU law (aquis communautaire).Furthermore, the Commission must prepare a report on the EU's financial framework covering the early years of the next century and likely effects of enlargement.Finally, before enlargement can take place, the Intergovernmental Conference must succeed in streamlining EU decision-making and institutions, extending EU responsibility for joint foreign and defence policies and improving cooperation in home affairs matters.  The EU has grown to fifteen members through four enlargements. Monetary integration is currently scheduled for 1999 and given the amount of effort made, there seems no way turning back.Monetary union is considered a logical extension of the single market and therefore, enlargement cannot be pursued at the expense of monetary union.Only after monetary union has started functioning, concrete actions can be taken in terms of enlargement.  Keywords: Integration, Central and Eastern Europe, the Europe Agreements, The European Union, the European Monetary Union, eastern enlargement. .

The subject of this article is East-West integration.Part two examines the issue of integration between East and West by introducing the club theory as applied to international relations.The general assumption of the club theory is that the costs and benefits are a function of the size of the club and that the club size will be expanded till the marginal costs equal the marginal benefits.Part three examines the concrete benefits and costs of EU enlargement.There are economic and political gains, budgetary costs, voting and migration effects involved in the integration between East and West.Finally, part four discusses visions and realism of further integration and suggestions for interim policies while achieving an integrated Europe. .

Patterns of Europeanisation in Central and Eastern Europe
Voting rules and budget allocation in an enlarged EU
The theoretical literature suggests four criteria for judging whether regions should form a currency area: mobility of labour and capital, flexibility of prices and wages, openness to trade and diversity of production.Regions that have relatively closed economies, narrow product ranges, strong price and wage rigidities, and low external mobility of labour and capital should not join monetary union, but should instead retain exchange-rate flexibility.  According to Maastricht Treaty, countries wishing to join EMU must fulfil the convergence criteria on interest rate levels, exchange rates, price stability and public debt.Several studies indicate that neither current EU-members nor the Central and Eastern European countries fully satisfy Mundell's criteria for optimal currency area (OCA) or EMU convergence criteria.Therefore, a European monetary union might run more smoothly if limited to a subset of EU members.  European Union is less of an optimal currency area than, for example, the US, due to lower factor mobility, more variable real exchange rates and slower response to aggregate shocks.Regarding to convergence criteria, it seems that the majoriy of the EU-countries satisfy the criteria to price stability whereas more efforts are needed where public debt is concerned.In respect of Central and Eastern European countries, the successful conclusion of systematic transformation and market oriented structural reforms is essential before participation in EMU.At present, countries should concentrate on maintaining their commitment to stabilization and on development further modern monetary and fiscal policies. Furthermore, they must complete financial sector reform, and liberalize capital movements.In addition, their central banks have to become fully independent and have price stability as primary objective.Actions should be taken to tackle factors that hinder the efficiency of monetary policy e.g. the volatility of money demand, the poor degree of privatization and competition in the banking sector, the non-existence of a enforcable bankruptcy law, the lack of development of money and securities markets and the problem "bad loans" in the banking sector.  Endogineity of OCA criteria argues that suitability of European countries, both Western and Eastern, for EMU cannot be judged on the basis of historical data since the structure of these economies is likely to change in EMU.The more countries integrate with each other, the more highly correlated will be their business cycles. Therefore, if a country, failing the OCA criteria now, goes ahead and joins EMU anyway, its trade linkages and income correlation with other EMU members are likely to rise as a consequence of entry into EMU.  Keywords: EMU, OCA, integration, transition, Central and Eastern Europe, enlargement .

Accession to the EU is one of the biggest challenges for the CEECs in the coming years.Sound and sustainable public finances are crucial for the transformation towards a market economy to be continued (completed), as well as for the country's ability to comply with the membership requirements.As the long-term macroeconomic stability depends heavily on sound and sustainable fiscal balances, the structural reforms that will strengthen public finances should be a task of a highest priority for applicant countries.  The measurement of the budgetary position in transition economies presents important difficulties, as the quality and comparability of statistics is still poor, and as those less visible forms of fiscal deficit (i.e. the quasi-fiscal deficit and the contingent deferred fiscal deficit) are clearly linked with the postponements in structural reforms.  Furthermore, there is unquestioned interdependence between fiscal policy (budgetary aggregates) and the transition process (changes in macro- and microeconomic performance of the country).Indeed, one can hardly expect a successful balanced-budget policy during the entire journey from plan to market.To the extent that fiscal imbalances reflect the costs of necessary adjustments, they may be temporarily justified (as 'transitional' deficits).Thus, the most difficult issue in designing and implementing fiscal policy during transition is choosing a proper balance between the need to achieve macroeconomic stability (which require fiscal discipline) and the need to pursue structural, market-oriented (and fiscally costly) reforms.In practice, in the short run, this can lead to conflicts between quality and quantity of fiscal adjustment.  When the quality of fiscal adjustment is poor, the current 'good' quantities are not the evidence of sound public finances.Slow progress in structural reforms, which is not fully reflected in current budgetary aggregates, poses a risk of future fiscal imbalances and constitutes a threat to macroeconomic stabilization and sustainable growth.Therefore, further progress in restructuring the economy and reducing the role that the state plays in production and resource allocation remain the main challenges for sustainable fiscal position in transition economies.   The current levels of government spending in the relatively poor transition countries are much too excessive.The need to finance high government spending (strongly dominated by current transfers) makes impossible the reduction of the overall heavy fiscal burden on the economy.Such a burden creates a strong barrier to fast growth and leads to the development of the underground economy.  With this unfavourable current situation any pressure on the expenditure side will deteriorate fiscal position.Such pressures will derive from the continuous progress in structural reform as well as from the process of the preparation to accession.  As discussed in this paper, the budget deficit, as usually measured, has important shortcomings as an indicator of sound and sustainable public finances in transition economies.But this does not mean that fiscal imbalances are the matter of irrelevance. Instead, the medium term reform programs should address the need to reduce the fiscal deficit, but this goal can be achieved only by reshaping government expenditure with priorities given to productive activities (such as investment in infrastructure and in human capital), together with reducing the size of public spending.   Keywords: budget, deficit, European Union, fiscal policy .

Abstract: This functional final thesis was done as part of the OSMOS project of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and the Eastern Family Centre of Helsinki City Social Services Department. The product of the final thesis – Integration Cards – was designed for instructors working with immigrant women to support the integration of immigrants into Finnish society. The product consists of discussion cards with two themes – ̋Finnish culture ̋ and  ̋Services ̋ – and helping questions and advice related to the cards for the instructor. For easy availability the product was created in a PDF format.     The theoretical framework of this final thesis is social pedagogy and its related means of interaction and dialogue. The cards are designed to be used in various groups for immigrant women where the participants can share information and experiences and learn from each other. The aim of the cards is to promote the adaptation of immigrant women into the new culture through the use of dialogue and interaction with each other. The cards also promote the learning of the Finnish language.     Both of the themes, Finnish culture and Services, include ten topics for discussion. On each card there is a picture and a Finnish word referring to the topic. The picture is designed to be understandable even if a participant is not familiar with the Finnish word. The role of the instructor is to lead the discussion, evoke further questions and provide information about Finnish culture and services.     The product was tested in groups of immigrant women and the results show that the use of the cards promotes interaction and dialogue and helps the instructors to deal with topics related to integration together with the participants. However, the outcomes are closely related to the structure of the group and the language skills of the participants. Future possibilities would be to develop the cards further by creating more themes according to the needs of participants.

Multiagency collaboration is seen as an essential way of working to promote the two-way integration of newcomers and a receiving society. The term multiagency collaboration underlines the diversity of actors in cooperation. Cross-sectorial networks are mentioned in higher strategies as well as in the local programmes or plans for action. But how is multiagency work structured at the local level? This article looks at the examples of multiagency collaboration in the written documents of local integration programmes in the Finnish context. The examples are chosen from different areas. It seems that collaboration is widely emphasized as a goal or a working method. Whereas expertise in integration work is relatively novel in Finland, more analytical awareness of multiagency collaboration could support learning in networks and developing hybrid practices in this emerging field of knowledge.

Is the EU enlargement the success EU institutions proclaim? Based on fifteen years of fieldwork research across Central and Eastern Europe and on migrants in the UK and Germany, this book provides a less glittering answer. The EU has betrayed hopes of social cohesion: social regulations have been forgotten, multinationals use threats of relocations, and workers, left without institutional channels to voice their concerns, have reacted by leaving their countries en masse. Yet migration, for many, increases social vulnerability. Drawing on Hirschman's concepts of 'Exit' and 'Voice', the book traces the origins of such failures in the management of EU enlargement as a pure economic and market-creating exercise, neglecting the inherently political nature of labour relations. The reinforcement of market mechanisms without political counterbalances has resulted in an increase in opportunistic 'exit' behaviour by both employers and employees, and thereby in a worsening quality of democracy, at workplace, national and European levels. As a result of this process, the EU has become more similar to the North American Free Trade Agreement between USA, Canada and Mexico, where social rights are marginalized and economic integration does not translate into better development.

While the European Union and Russia are actively working to strengthen their relations, the challenge of effective cooperation can only be called problematic given the pressures faced by an expanding EU and the dynamics of present-day Russia.Nevertheless, the arguments for improving relations for both parties are overwhelming as closer ties ultimately promote the economic prosperity and political stability of the entire region. EU-Russian cooperation is presently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).The EU and Russia have also agreed to start discussions on creation of a free trade area. While the framework of cooperation is already in place, implementation of the PCA will demand greater resources than current capacity allows.Russia will bear the heaviest burden as it will have to develop functions longestablished in the EU.To ease this transition, the EU provides technical assistance to Russia through its Tacis programme and similar programmes.These constitute a good-faith commitment on the part of the EU to a functioning market economy, political democracy as well as a working system of education and social welfare in Russia. Both parties acknowledge the other's importance as a trading partner currently, trade mainly consits of oil, natural gas and refined metals exported by Russia and machinery and vechiles exported by the EU.The asymmetry of this relationship complicates competition and trade policy.Russia's competitive weaknesses in certain sectors make it very tempting to revert to protectionist pressures which will hinder liberalization of trade and potentially jeopardize the implementation of the PCA. Although critics have called attention to the excessive optimism and impracticalities of the PCA and Tacis, they nevertheless concede that their spirit embodies a willingness by both parties to promote better relations.And despite obvious areas of contention between the EU and Russia (especially in trade policies), there has been a consistent willingness to discuss positions and seek mutually acceptable solutions.Given the general complexity of EU-Russia relations, this willingness to sort things out will be fundamental to all future progress. Keywords: Russia, EU, integration, foreign trade, partnership and cooperation agreement .
The aim of this study was to investigate how immigrants have integrated into Finnish life from the standpoints of employment. The empirical research material consisted of 30 interviews with immigrants and four interviews with of? cials and others dealing with immigrant affairs. Factors promoting employment of immigrants were the voluntary nature of the immigration, educational quali? cations as demonstrated by the relevant certi? cates and knowledge of the Finnish language. One in three reported that they had ? rst received information about vacancies from the Employment Of? ce, and one in ? ve by approaching the employer directly asking for work. One in seven had found out about jobs through friends. .

The world is facing inhumane and barbaric acts of terrorism which is destroying the world peace. Angry, reactionary voices distort the peaceful message of Islam and present it as a violent ideology that calls for indiscriminate killings and suicidal terrorism. Such voices are denying the possibility of a harmonious coexistence between Muslims and non-Muslims. Under such circumstances there is an urgent need for the authentic voices of Islamic scholarship to reassert the normative, mainstream teachings of Islam. Voices backed by 1400 years of scholarship that represent the creed of the overwhelming majority of the Muslim World. The Islamic Curriculum on Peace and Counter-Terrorism aims to provide resources from the Holy Qur'an, Hadith and authoritative books to provide a comprehensive ideological and theological counter narrative. This timely collection consists of three lectures delivered by the world renowned authority, Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Tahir ul-Qadri who has published over 450 books and delivered over 5500 lectures to date.
