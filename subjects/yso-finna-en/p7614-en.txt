By regarding children as actors and conducting empirical research on children's agency, Childhood Studies have gained significant influence on a wide range of different academic disciplines. This has made agency one of the key concepts of Childhood Studies, with articles on the subject featured in handbooks and encyclopaedias. Reconceptualising Agency and Childhood is the first collection devoted to the central concept of agency in Childhood Studies. With contributions from experts in the field, the chapters cover theoretical, practical, historical, transnational and institutional dimensions of agency, rekindling discussion and introducing fundamental and contemporary sociological perspectives to the field of research. Particular attention is paid to connecting agency in the social sciences with Childhood Studies, considering both the theoretical foundations and the practice of research into agency. Empirical case studies are also explored, which focus upon child protection, schools and childcare at a variety of institutions worldwide. This book is an essential reference for students and scholars of Childhood Studies, and is also relevant to Sociology, Social Work, Education, Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) and Geography.

This article assesses co-operative features of forestry advising encounters with an emphasis on their pedagogical positioning. The study argues that only an in-depth analysis can reveal the multifaceted nature of the advisory interaction and provide systematic justifications for extension service enhancement. Authentic video recordings of advisory encounters between a forestry extension advisor (FEA) and family forest owners (FFOs) are scrutinized using the qualitative approach of conversation analysis and the initiation–response–evaluation pedagogical sequence model. Although the actual interplay of the participants was founded on a distinct role differentiation (i.e. teacher–student), situational and contingent variations between formal and informal positioning emerged. The FFOs proved active in making initiatives (e.g. posing questions) and thus influencing the agenda of the meetings, whereas the FEA's speech turns were mostly used to restore the conventional hierarchical positioning. However, the results show that expert-directed service and customer-orientated services are not mutually exclusive. Effective forestry advisory practice is a rather socially motivated action embodied with talk and other means of communication. Thus the current emphasis on Internet-based services provides only halfway solutions, because virtual guidance lacks many of the interactive elements provided in face-to-face advisory encounters.
The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate and show how productization can enhance joint service creation for Research Laboratories based on UNELMA-project. The goal is to create a joint service that is simple, manageable and understandable by all stakeholders. How productization enhances joint service creation for research laboratories have been discussed comprehensively. The literature review shows that the actual benefits of a service offering can accrue to service providers as well as service consumers if a service is well productized. The research approach is a combination of qualitative and case study methods. Data is collected through workshops, project articles, documents and observation aided by service creation tools. The service creation tools used are; Idea tree, Service blue print, Business model canvas, Value proposition canvas and Productization canvas. Joint service network stakeholder’s expectation has been examined from the data gathered. Both service providers and customers have their own expectations. However, they have a common ground of collaboration and cooperation into the future through a productized joint service network branded Applied Imaging Network abbreviated as AIN. Ultimately, productization enhances service creation and assists in sales marketing by making the service simple, manageable and understandable. Thus, it makes easier for the customer to make buying decision.
