"In its efforts to assist post-conflict societies in africa the international aid community has acitvely promoted projects of psycho-social healing among people traumatized during wars and violent conflict. To a large degree these projects have been established in the tradtion of Western psychology. More recently, however, it has been realized in order to help survivors of war effectivley it is necessary to adapt projects and enhance "local" psycho-social healing. This policy report locates the structures - with local legitimacy - that are available to young people who experienced sexual abuse during the Sierra Leone civil war (1991-2002). To this end, this booklet discusses a healing complex that comprises a number of overlapping actors, including herbalists, Zoe Mammies (heads of the female secret societies), Mori-men (Muslim healers); Karamokos (Muslim teachers) and Christian pastors." --Publisher's description.

With a collection of updated texts on religion, healing practices, and beliefs, this book takes us from the time of the Sámi noaidi («shaman”) up to the present day. The book begins with a chapter on the pre-Christian noaidevuohta («shamanism”), followed by an account of the violent persecution of the Sámi pre-Christian way of life in the 1600s and 1700s. Then we are introduced to Laestadianism, the pietistic, Lutheran movement founded by Lars Levi Laestadius that took hold in the North and Lule Sámi areas in the middle of the 1850s. Finally, we learn about Sámi folk medicine traditions, which continue to exist alongside modern forms of medicine, thus representing cultural continuity and belief in traditional values from the time of the noaidi.

"Belianis an exceptionally lively tradition of shamanistic curing rituals performed by the Luangans, a politically marginalized population of Indonesian Borneo. This volume explores the significance of these rituals in practice and asks what belian rituals do - socially, politically, and existentially - for particular people in particular circumstances. Departing from the conception that rituals exist as ethereal, liminal or insulated traditional domains, this volume demonstrates the importance of understanding rituals as emergent within their specific historical and social settings. It offers an analysis of a number of concrete ritual performances, exemplifying a diversity of ritual genres, stylistic modalities and sensual ambiences, from low-key, habitual affairs to drawn-out, crowd-seizing community rituals and innovative, montage-like cultural experiments"--
