This bachelor thesis describes multi platform mobile application testing process. Marmalade Software Development Kit was used as a primer environment for development and testing process. The thesis is divided into three major parts. The first describes development environment and target platforms. The second part introduces testing basics. The third part describes actual process of testing of the application. Arcade type game Glow Hockey 3D was a part of research part. This application was tested from the beginning of the development process and is still monitored. The application was successfully released on Google Play market and received mostly positive reviews from the critics. Post release problems appeared, however, their number was not great. As a result, multiplatform testing and development saved a lot of time and money since there was no need to double the application on another platform with different environment.

It is fair to say that Agile development is today's major trend. It is used more or less in every company if the company is involved in mobile software industry. Agile development is also widely used in other embedded software development. It is recognized to be a very effective and efficient way of development. However, there are many issues which are needed to be considered and taken into account when transferring to this process model. Especially the transferring period can be very difficult and have a long lasting effect to a company. The aim of this Master's thesis was to study more deeply this subject and find a different way to conquer the challenges what comes to this subject. There are so many positive experiences from this, but normally some of the negative sides have been left out. I have experienced a transfer in my own career and I saw really close what kind of things are usually left out and not told. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate how well Agile methods suit in embedded software development. Agile works well what comes just to software projects, but when talking about embedded development, the process is not always so easy. Embedded devices vary for example from small music players to big and complex medical devices. This thesis will concentrate only on small portable devices, since my experience comes from that field. I used mainly my own experiences and situations I have met to find a suitable process. In theory parts I used different publications from the Internet and books to back up my knowledge. I managed to present basic practices and processes from different methodologies that I discovered as good in embedded development. Next steps would be to test these different processes in practice. Since there are many different kinds of embedded systems out there, every modified process has to be first tested in a real life before it can be decided whether can it be taken in to use or not.
Infrastructure and mobile radio devices hardware can be roughly divided in three different sections: RF (Radio Frequency), DFE (Digital Front End) and BB (Baseband). RF and DFE sections can vary between different products, but usually the BB section is very similar. Because of this the testing of the Baseband section is also similar between different products and versions. The time between different product versions is rational to minimize to keep the product schedule of a product announcement on time. This fact brings a schedule pressure to a Research and Development testing. Products should be tested faster and the test coverage should be sufficient. This Master’s thesis was commissioned by Elektrobit Wireless Communications Oy. Infrastructure and mobile radio device planning belongs to their portfolio. The aim of this Thesis was to speed up and to ease the work of test designers and test operators. It was done by creating a ready test library for the research and development phase testing. The library contains basic information and examples about different tests done to a device under test. The same library will also help in measurement instruments acquisition and resource planning. SpiraTest test management software was used in test library generation. The purpose of the Automation is to investigate how Research and Development phase Baseband testing can be speed up. LabVIEW programming language was chosen to be used as automation tool. The main reason for its selection was the available device drivers. Clock signal quality measurement test was chosen to be automated. The oscilloscope setup for different signals and results saving was automated.

The aim of this thesis was to improve the quality of the website, to increase the efficiency, productivity, user friendliness as well as minimize the number of errors encountered by the users while navigating the site. Making the website easier to use benefits the company to know which parts customers would select the most. The owner of the company would be able to redesign their website, add new features to target certain customers, edit an unclear or confusing feature and get information on a lacking content or features from the users. The test was done according to the Thinking Aloud test method and to collect and analyze the results, five different individuals having some technical knowledge were participated in the usability test. The participants were tested in a different time schedule in a well managed testing room. All the tasks done by the participants were recorded by the Morae Software during the test and this software was totally invisible to the test participants. It helped to find out the most lacking areas and whether the test users have the same type of usability problems on the website or not. After the usability test was completed, the results were analysed and compiled into a report, which contains actionable recommendations for fixing the observed issues from the test users with the website. Although the website was easy to use, user friendly and had some problems, the prototype visual version of the redesigned website was made and handed to the client.

As the constantly changing workload has been a problem in the TCC Nokia OTA, EMC and SAR type approval laboratory, there is a need to evolve the training process of a new employee and to re-think the division of tasks within the laboratory This thesis explains the meaning of and the reason for OTA, EMC and SAR measurements. Also the purpose and advantages of the international standard ISO/IEC 17025 are discussed briefly. The research section goes through the testing procedure i.e. actions before the testing, the testing itself and finally the actions after testing. The goal is to clarify how to organize the training process in a rational way and how the tasks in the laboratory should be divided among the employees. The research was carried out by observing the laboratory personnel in their work and by interviewing them. In addition to that, also studying the international standard ISO/IEC 17025 and the working instructions produced by the employees of each testing area had a major role in the research. As outcome, there is a rough plan how the tasks in the laboratory could be divided to get the efficiency and quality optimized and a plan to organize an efficient training for a new employee. The point in the task division is to make the test operators do the simplest and repetitive tasks and thereby relieve time for the test engineers and test system managers to concentrate on their own tasks. The test operators training should start with a short introduction to the organization and the testing areas, and finally to the testing equipment. The training for running the measurements should be made one test at a time, from the beginning to the end. Naturally, the most efficient way would be to start the training from the easiest test, but it would be difficult to organize, so the training follows the ongoing testing. Other actions related to testing, making reports, daily checks and calibrations, can be trained when ever they are considered to be needed.

Language in Social Life is a major series which highlights the importance of language to an understanding of issues of social and professional concern. It will be of practical relevance to all those wanting to understand how the ways we communicate both influence and are influenced by the structures and forces of contemporary social institutions. In all modern societies individuals are subject to tests, whether to enter educational programs, to pass from one level to the next or to grant certificates to practice. Yet, tests are powerful tools which are often introduced in undemocratic and unethical ways as disciplinary tools for carrying out various policy agendas. Tests can be detrimental to people's lives as they are capable of affecting and defining the knowledge and behaviour of those who are being tested. The Power of Tests applies a critical perspective of language tests by examining their uses and consequences in education and society and by viewing tests not as isolated events but rather as embedded in social, educational and political contexts. The book is divided into four parts: the first part establishes the power of tests through echoing the voices of test takers, describing the features of the power of tests, and the temptations that tests offer to bureaucrats who use them for power and control. The second part reports on studies that provide empirical evidence about intentions and effects of a number of large scale language tests. The third part interprets the results by examining their consequences on education and society, arriving at a model of tests' use. The final section of the book offers strategies for controlling and minimising the misuses of tests by introducing the notion of Critical Language Testing which calls for the examination of the consequences and misuses of tests, monitoring of power and pointing to their unethical uses. It also provides a comprehensive discussion of the responsibilities of language testers, including a new Code of Ethics, as well as strategies for guarding and protecting the rights of test takers.

Testing of VoIP security problems is essential to enterprises providing real-time data and services. The critical infrastructure can be compromised and data to be regularly exposed. This information may be used by malicious hackers for illegal purposes. At the same time consumers are connecting their smartphones and other personal devices to the network. The business with private and secured data is becoming more and more important in our everyday life. The major security threat for enterprises today is discovering existing unknown vulnerabilities from used software. Unknown vulnerabilities may cause a lot of serious problems, attacks utilizing security holes may continue undetected (while customer safety is compromised) and the repair process tends to be slow once an attack is detected. Additionally, during maintenance there is downtime when customer services are not accessible. Naturally, all downtime is damaging company reputation and eventually affecting to company profits. Security related bugs are likely to exist in platforms when facing with new technologies which are complex to implement and when software versions are often a released detriment of testing. Also, an increasing number of vulnerabilities have not been published but instead those may end to be used and shared within underground hacker communities. Companies and enterprises need to find preventive actions to protect their products and services because it takes too much time to wait fixed software releases from vendors. In this thesis work the protocol model from a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is implemented using the Codenomicon Test Tool platform. The product can send valid and anomalous data transmissions to the test application over the Internet. This is technique (or testing method) called fuzzing or fuzz testing. Software robustness can be verified and unknown or zero-day vulnerabilities may be found with fuzzing. RTP data is typically audio, video or other streaming content. RTP data (or media stream) is usually transferred and embedded within another protocol. The SRTP Test Suite can utilize other Codenomicon test tools to do media signaling negotiation with the test targets in a way which is secure when it comes to cryptography. Thus, the result of the connection parameters may be used to get connected with a wider variety of test targets and send an SRTP fuzzing data stream to these applications.

This Bachelor’s thesis was commissioned by OY LM Ericsson AB. The work was done at Ericsson’s premises in Oulu. Oulu premises concentrate on re-search and development of base station solutions for WCDMA and LTE-networks. The purpose of this thesis was to automate base station test cases in a real RNC-environment in a WCDMA-network, mainly traffic cases that measure average throughput in different conditions and settings. The main aim of this automation was to automate some of the testing so that human resources that were consumed by this basic testing could be assigned to something more useful. And of course automation could bring much needed stability and better regression to testing. Other aims were to document the used equipment and choose test cases to automate. The aims were achieved so that the chosen transfer multi-RAB and soft hando-ver test cases were automated. All of the test cases are not possible to auto-mate but few more should be possible. Unfortunately that was not possible in time reserved for this thesis. The used equipment was also documented. Auto-mation is in use for daily software release testing now. This automation could be taken further for example by attaching a signal ana-lyzer with an Ethernet connection. This would enable antenna power measurements. Robustness testing cases are possible to add to this system. Adding a third base station to the attenuator would add many different variations for handovers.

It is important for a company, whose income is based on the number of the active customers to have a way to track how well they can keep their customers and to know what their customers think about their services. The aim of this Bachelor’s thesis was to develop a new feature that allows the manager of a company to track the rate in which company loses active customers and a way that allows managers to create surveys or ask questions that can help them to improve their services, this information can then help them reduce the rate in which they lose customers. The feature was developed using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and MySQL. PHPUnit testing framework was utilized for testing backend PHP code and Twig template engine was utilized for frontend PHP. As a result of this thesis, a new feature was implemented into an existing system. This feature has 2 views. The first one allows the manager of a company to view the customer attrition rate displayed as a line chart or in a table. Another one allows the manager to create questions for the customers and the created questions will then be displayed to customers when they log into the service. In future the feature can be expanded to track the rate of how long customers stay active after joining or adding new types of tracked customers by age, family relations or group exercise.

This Master’s thesis concentrates on a particular tool, called Äly Excel, which is used in health care centres in Finland. The Äly Excel is a Microsoft Excel based tool that helps to plan a health care personnel rota. The main goal of this work was to enhance usability of the Äly Excel. The development work was part of the Hyvä Potku project that is managed by Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District. To find out the most important usability problems of the Äly Excel, usability tests were carried out in an early phase of the project work. Also, a questionnaire was sent out to gather user experience and possible suggestions for improvements. Once the feedback and user test observations were analysed and agreed with the Hyvä Potku project members, the development of the Äly Excel began. Since the Äly Excel is a Microsoft Excel based worksheet, it was natural to choose Visual Basic as a programming language as Visual Basic Application is part of the Microsoft Office package. New UI features are designed so that they follow well-known usability studies. In this thesis a usability theory is observed and discussed. The thesis details the software and UI design and why certain decisions were made. The problems faced during the development work are explained. At the end there is a discussion about the future development of the Äly Excel.

Assessment of skin physiology is moving rapidly away from a purely descriptive approach as we gain a deeper understanding of biophysical and biochemical processes in the stratum corneum, such as those relating to its barrier function and hydration. As a result of research utilizing bioengineering methods, reliable and reproducible approaches are now available for product testing in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as well as in basic research. This book examines in detail all aspects of cosmetic testing -- legal, general, and practical. After discussion of regulatory and ethical issues and guidelines, essential guidance is provided on the planning, performance, and evaluation of scientific studies in skin physiology. The topics addressed range from laboratory and staffing requirements through to testing devices and methods, factors influencing measurements, and study design. In addition, detailed information is provided on test settings for a range of cosmetic products. All of the authors are recognized experts in their field. This book will be invaluable to researchers, students, and medical staff in explaining how best to assess skin functions in controlled studies using non-invasive biophysical instruments.
