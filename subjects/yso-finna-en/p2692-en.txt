Revenue is the "top" line on the income statement and is the fundamental driver of business success. It is essential that managers and executives understand the complexities involved in recognizing revenue under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the US Revenue Recognition principles are , are primarily concerned with two things: (a) the timing aspect (the when issue) and (b) the amount to be recorded (the how much issue). This book will provide extensive guidance in assisting managers with the appropriate answers to the two questions above for their companies. This book is principally designed for managers and executives who have organizational responsibility for delivering results in the form of "profits" for their organizations. The book will be a comprehensive yet readable examination of the existing rules of revenue recognition for corporate entities. After reading the book, the manager or executive will have a thorough understanding of how accountants measure and record revenue. This "skill-set" will prove invaluable in understanding the impact that their business decisions will have on the financial statements with an emphasis on the income statement and the statement of cash flows. The book will also have an executive-level overview of the proposed "IASB and FASB Standard: Revenue from Contracts with Customers."

The objective of the study was to analyze how farmers' managerial thinking and management process effectiveness contribute to profitability of farming. A structural equation model of these two elements of management capacity and financial performance was applied on survey data and bookkeeping results from 117 dairy farms. The model explained one-fourth of the varying profitability of sample farms. The results show that farmers' managerial thinking is connected to farm profitability, but management process effectiveness is not. It was concluded that it is essential for good performance that the farmer has a clear vision of developing farming with business and investment plans. Successful farmers also have a firm confidence in their managerial skills, a strong emphasis on instrumental and intrinsic values, and a high appreciation of farming as occupation. They also see the farm as an entrepreneurial business unit and intend to follow the corresponding principles of management.

Accounting : an introduction / Eddie McLaney and Peter Atrill
This paper surveys the literature on ownership structure and corporate governance in Russia.The market structure is compared to traditional German and Anglo-Saxon market models.We argue that the Russian market constitutes a dynamic hybrid of the two models, i.e. its direction of development has yet to be resolved.As several current cases indicate, the risk of unfair treatment of minority shareholders in Russian companies is considerable.While we acknowledge that both the legal framework and the incentives of the management are equally important in protecting minority shareholder rights, the scope of the paper is deliberately limited to discussion of the legal framework.The information disclosure requirements of Russian companies are compared with the US requirements.Also the regulatory bodies in the two countries are discussed.Some differences between International Accounting Standards and Russian accounting practice are also reviewed.The final part of the paper is dedicated to the recent reforms proposed by the Russian government regarding disclosure and protection of minority shareholder rights. Keywords: ownership structure, shareholders, information disclosure, FCSM, Russia .

Careers in accountancy
Accounting is frequently portrayed as a value-free mechanism for allocating resources and ensuring they are employed in the most efficient manner. Contrary to this popular opinion, the research presented in Accounting at War demonstrates that accounting for military forces is primarily a political practice. Throughout history, military force has been so pervasive that no community of any degree of complexity has succeeded in surviving without an army. Through to the present day, for all nation states, accounting for the military and its operations has primarily served broader political purposes. From the Crimean War to the War on Terror, accounting has been used to assert civilian control over the military, instill rational business practices on war, and create the visibilities and invisibilities necessary to legitimize the use of force. Accounting at War emphasizes the significant power that financial and accounting controls gave to political elites and the impact of these controls on military performance. Accounting at War examines the effects of these controls in wars such as the Crimean, South African and Vietnam Wars. Accounting at War also emphasizes how accounting has provided the means to rationalize and normalize violence, which has often contributed to the acceleration and expansion of war. Aimed at researchers and academics in the fields of accounting, accounting history, political management and sociology, Accounting at War represents a unique and critical perspective to this cutting-edge research field.
