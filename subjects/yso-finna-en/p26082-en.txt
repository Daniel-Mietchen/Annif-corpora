deans
A deanship is now seen as more of a phase in an overall academic career than as a permanent shift from teaching to administration. In fact, the nature of the job itself has changed, as has the range of likely options at the end of a dean's tenure. This book serves as a guide for the aspiring or new dean, offering practical advice on how to approach the interview process and the new job, as well as providing a thoughtful assessment of the deanship in its wider context. The authors – both experienced academic deans at a variety of institutions – encourage the new or experienced dean to reflect on the larger issues, and address the realities of deaning from several perspectives in efforts to illuminate both the challenges and rewards of the job.
