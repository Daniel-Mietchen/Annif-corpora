Political-military relations and the stability of Arab regimes
"This book compares two countries and with common institutional structures and other similarities and a fruitful platform for the study of the similarities and differences in economic and societal development of Japan and Finland. Despite their geographic distance from one another and the differences in their cultures, economic structures, and relative sizes, both countries experienced a rather similar economic and societal development pattern after the Second World War. The book provides comprehensive coverage on issues such as welfare society, educational system, a transition from agricultural sector to high tech sector, and bubble and its collapse, thus, typical to these countries, from a longitudinal perspective. The book aims to answer a fundamental question in social science --- "why there seem to be common trends and developmental paths among countries differing in size, culture, and economic structure?" This book will provide insight for those seeking to decipher how the developments in their own countries came about and where they may be headed to. "--
