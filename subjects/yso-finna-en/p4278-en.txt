Using clear, readable prose, conceptual artist and poet Kenneth Goldsmith's manifesto shows how our time on the Internet is not really wasted but is quite productive and creative as he puts the experience in its proper theoretical and philosophical context. Kenneth Goldsmith thinks the Internet demands active engagement - and it's actually making us more social, more creative, even more productive. When we're "wasting time," we're actually creating a culture of collaboration. Wide-ranging, counterintuitive, engrossing, unpredictable - like the Internet itself - this is the manifesto you didn't know you needed.
