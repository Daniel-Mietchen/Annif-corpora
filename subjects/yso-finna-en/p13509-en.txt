The concept of possession is central to human experience. Thus the variety of ways in which we can "have" diverse items such as a family, an idea, or a headache is matched by a rich array of linguistic structures. An understanding of the full range of possible structural variation requires the study of languages in both natural modalities, signed and spoken, making this volume a very timely addition to research in the target domain. This volume summarises results from a large-scale typological investigation on possession and existence in 28 sign languages around the world. It includes detailed investigations of sign language data from Venezuela, Belgium, Jordan, Uganda, Japan, Austria, Catalonia, and the US, as well as two sign languages from "deaf villages", in Bali and in Ghana. Detailed data from village communities with a high incidence of hereditary deafness offer particularly fascinating insights and have never before featured in a comparative typological study. The volume also includes the full set of elicitation materials used for data collection in this cross-linguistic study, as well as a CD/DVD with video clips illustrating examples from the sign language data.

"This volume of new work explores the nature of verb serialisation in a range of languages from the Pacific region - both Austronesian and non-Austronesian. Serial verbs can be described linguistically as a sequence of verbs which behave as a single complex predicate. A particular focus of this book is the detailed examination given by most authors to the relationship of such uniclausal linguistic structures with the real world notion of eventhood. The book also makes a valuable addition to the description and analysis of serial verb constructions from the Pacific, a region which has generally been under-represented in cross-linguistic discussions of verb serialisation. The book will appeal to syntacticians and typologists as well as to Austronesianists and Papuanists."--Provided by publisher.
