This thesis is commissioned by HAMK University of Applied Sciences. The number of degree programmes conducted in English in HAMK UAS has grown significantly during recent years and as the amount of foreign degree students has increased, HAMK UAS has faced new challenges. The objectives of the thesis were to obtain an extensive picture of the previous researches on this topic area and the actions taken in order to improve the situation, to analyse the current state of HAMK's foreign degree students' work placements, to recognise the challenges that foreign degree students face when searching for work placement positions, and to give recommendations for HAMK in how it could enhance foreign degree students' chances in getting work placement positions from Finland. In order to reach the objectives, several prior researches were used to find out what is currently known about foreign degree students' integration to Finland and their access to jobs here and what has been done in order to improve the situation. A survey was conducted for foreign degree students of HAMK to discover the students' thoughts and experiences concerning work placements and integration to Finland. Interviews with the staff members were used to hear their thoughts and experiences about foreign degree students' work placements and to benchmark the work placement processes in degree programmes conducted in English. As a result of the research HAMK was given recommendations to re-check the resources allocated to work placement, to add the number of Finnish language courses and a course that focuses on the Finnish work culture, to enhance foreign degree students' contacts to employers and to the Finnish fellow students.
