Our place, my future and their project : reflecting children's lifeworld in education for sustainable development
The organisations of higher education are constantly changing. Universities,  colleges, private schools and online universities refine their pedagogical  methods and learning models in a competitive market. This article is a study  on whether one such model helps students to gain new knowledge. A study  of the LAB studio model (LSM), which is a pedagogical model developing  connections between working-life based problems and the recognition and  development of business-related prototypes and start-up companies, is presented.  The LSM, theoretically grounded in a constructivist view of learning  with a project-based education at its core, has the key goal of educating  entrepreneurial competences in higher education. Based on the case study,  comprising a literature review of knowledge creation and a survey, the qualitative  results analysis suggests that LSM offers a promising support for knowledge  creation. The results lead to the conclusion that LSM provides support  especially for the various modes of the SECI model, such as socialisation  and internalisation, and seems to support organisational knowledge creation  aspects as well.

New social technologies have emerged in response to the changing work environment and working methods. The objective of this thesis was to study if there are any benefits or advantages in using a digital workspace service, AAPO Social Workspace, in a project-based work environment in the Commissioner organisation, Avalon Oy. This thesis aims to answer those questions in order for to gain researched data, and to further develop the service. The theoretical framework concerns the fundamentals of Web 2.0, digital workspaces and project management in general. This information provides the reader with an understanding of what the main functionalities in Web 2.0 are, and an understanding of project management and some of the aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Research data was collected through a survey that was conducted in the Commissioner organisation. The results suggest that using the service is of value and holds various benefits and advantages for the employees, including centralized communications, improved communality and ease of use. Moreover, key findings illustrate that the service is of value to project managers as well in managing project teams and clients. In conclusion, this study presents the reader with an introduction to project management, an overview of Web 2.0 and its applications, and the service and its features. The results are presented in a concise way, illustrating the use of the service in the Commissioner organisation. In-depth analysis and conclusions based on the results are provided for the reader.

Visualizing project management : a model for business and technical success
Ongoing research shows that whilst 90 per cent of large companies are conducting global projects to take advantage of distributed skills, around-the-clock operations and virtual team environments, less than one third of them have effective, established practices to help project managers and team members working over a distance. As a consequence, most organizations struggle to reach the required levels of quality and effectiveness from these projects because their methods and practices are not adapted to a global multi-cultural environment, where most communication is in writing and asynchronous. "Global Project Management" describes how to adapt your organization and your projects to thrive in this environment.The book goes beyond the recommendations on collaborative tools, to suggest the development of best practices on cross-cultural team management and global communication, recommend organizational changes and project structures, and propose alternatives for the implementation of the new practices and methods.The text is filled with real-life examples and techniques and illustrates how to apply the recommendations as part of the successful management of any global project.

This Thesis is based on the medieval event held in Turku from June 25 to June 28, 2009. The idea for this thesis came during a work period at Wäinö Aaltonen museum in October 2008. The Thesis presents the reader with an example of producing a large scale event from the perception of the project team responsible for the organization of the happening. The point of the work is to show how the theory of project planning, organization and marketing (product, price, place promotion) fits into a practical example of a happening. The structure of the thesis follows the standard formula of event creation found in many practical guides. It tries to maintain a chronological order but compromises have been made at different points when needed to keep clearness for the reader. Most of the data in the thesis are personal notes and details collected during the project's creation. Theoretical material used for the thesis lean towards books, personal knowledge on the subject and Turku University of Applied Sciences course materials. The frame of reference material was limited to event organization to avoid overextending the theory basis. None the less Event organization in itself loans a lot of from other theories like business management, marketing, finances making the “sources” quite wide. Because of this theoretical literature is quite varied at times. The Thesis was started with assembling all the notes and data about the event and then by creating a coherent structure to it. It was written step by step supported by the existing theory available. Some of the work for the thesis was done already during the planning process for the event, for example the market research, customer surveys and their analyses. The most important finding in the thesis is that the event did actually not follow such a rigid set of rules defined by the theory associated to the subject. In many cases the standard procedures of event organization were not followed. Further quantitative research should be conducted to make any definite conclusions on this finding. As a note to the reader this thesis is not a practical guide how to stage an event, but should be considered as additional reading material for someone interested on the subject. By giving example on how the theory is implemented into practise it hopes to enlighten the subject.

Oulu UAS educates professionals for the needs of Northern Finland, whose competence corresponds to the needs and development of working life in the region. We react quickly to the changes occurring in working life and the requirements of new competence.    At the degree programme of Information Technology we aim to develop our teaching to include more real-life project work: our curricula include increasingly more company-related projects. This way we are able to provide our students with a more realistic view of the everyday work at companies, and also improve their employment opportunities.    The purpose of this publication is to spread the word about the projects and results achieved by the students and staff of the Information Technology department. In addition to student projects, our department is also involved in many domestic and international projects well worth mentioning. Yearly, our students complete hundreds of thesis and project work. This publication also presents good examples of our successful projects.
