The dead will tell
Highly acclaimed in previous editions - with more than 85,000 copies in print - this classic work by John Hostetler has been expanded and updated to reflect current research on Amish history and culture, as well as the new concerns of Amish communities throughout North America. In this fourth edition of Amish Society, Hostetler takes the reader inside Amish culture and explains the nature of Amish religious beliefs and ceremonies, community and family life, tensions with worldly values, and interactions with outsiders. He offers updated information on a variety of topics, including Amish population trends, land use and farming practices, and relations with the state. Amish communities - found primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana - continue to attract millions of tourists each year. Yet most visitors, misled by stereotypes and commercial attractions, do not have the opportunity to understand the Amish as they really are. Indeed, the simple dress and traditional habits of the Amish tend to mask the complexity of their way of life. John Hostetler's portrait of the Amish people effectively captures the depth and diversity of their enduring culture. John A. Hostetler is the author of "Amish Roots: A Treasury of History, Wisdom, and Lore" and "Hutterite Society", both available from Johns Hopkins.

The authors argue that the intensely private and insular Amish have devised creative ways to negotiate with modernity that have enabled them to thrive in America. The transformation of the Amish in the American imagination from "backward bumpkins" to media icons poses provocative questions. What does the Amish story reveal about the American character, popular culture, and mainstream values? Richly illustrated, The Amish is the definitive portrayal of the Amish in America in the twenty-first century.
