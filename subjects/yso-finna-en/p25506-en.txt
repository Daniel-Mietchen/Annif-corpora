Effects of the severe winter of 1965/66 upon winter bird fauna in Finland
The aim of this study was to provide novel information on the change of cognitive performance and its predictors in early midlife between ages of 34 and 43 years. The change in verbal episodic memory between non-psychotic and schizophrenia samples was compared in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. In the non-psychotic sample, associations between primary school performance, sociodemographic factors and body mass index (BMI), and in the schizophrenia sample, between premorbid school performance and severity of illness with the change in cognitive performance were evaluated. There was no evidence of greater decline in verbal episodic memory in the schizophrenia sample, compared to the non-psychotic sample, though the schizophrenia sample had an overall lower cognitive performance at the baseline. In the non-psychotic sample, male gender, poorer school performance, increases in BMI and having no children predicted a decline in verbal episodic memory; poorer school performance and low vocational education and occupational class predicted a decline in visual episodic memory; and having children predicted a decline in executive function. In the schizophrenia sample, poorer premorbid school performance, but not the later course of illness, was related to a decline in cognitive performance. This study is one of the few studies to investigate the predictors of change in cognitive performance in the early middle-aged general population, and the first to investigate the predictors of cognitive change in early midlife schizophrenia. To summarize; poor cognitive performance in adolescence may be considered as a vulnerability marker for a later impairment in cognitive functioning. In schizophrenia, cognitive ability possibly declines mostly in a normative fashion with aging at the same rate as in the general population rather than as a result of neurodegenerative processes. These results might improve our understanding of midlife change in cognitive functioning and may also help to develop effective interventions of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
