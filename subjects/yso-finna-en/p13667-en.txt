This thesis aims at answering the question regarding the reasonability of real options valuation in the hotel industry by conducting a case study with the support of secondary and primary research.  By incorporating the value of individual capital investment opportunities into a project's gross  present value, real options valuation can be characterised as an extension of traditional valua-tion approaches such as the discounted cash flow methods, thereby reducing their uncertainty,  inflexibility, and incomprehensiveness.    Taking advantage of the analogy between financial and real options, institutionalised valuation methods such as the Black-Scholes formula (1973) or the binomial options pricing model by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) have been applied to evaluate different options of a real hotel investment project.     Although controversially discussed and so far practically unproven in the hotel industry due to a certain complexity, it is shown that it can be very valuable to incorporate real options into the valuation process.      Based on several simplifications and by recognising the need to investigate each individual option more in detail, this thesis reveals that the evaluation of real options can serve as an important decision base for hotel investors under the condition of a fairly certain future outlook and relatively stable environmental conditions.
