Effect of mist, irrigation and plant density levels on rutin content of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.)
Deterioration in the quality of ground water in some municipal water supply plants
To determine the effects of some environmental factors on rutin content of common buckwheat, an experiment was conducted in split-split-plot, based on RCBD design with three replications. The relative humidity (mist and non-mist treatments), irrigation (20 and 40 mm/m² treatments) and plant density (33.3 and 100 plants/m² series) were performed. Results showed that the rutin content was significantly affected by single and interaction effects of the factors studied at the 0.01 level of probability, so that, in the case of rutin content, mist and irrigation of 20 mm/m² and 100 plant/m² treatments showed high concentration. The greatest content of rutin was obtained from treatments comprising non-mist, 20 mm/m² water irrigation and 100 plants/m².
