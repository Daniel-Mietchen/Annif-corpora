"Robert Smithson (1938-1973) produced his best-known work during the 1960s and early 1970s, a period in which the boundaries of the art world and the objectives of art-making were questioned perhaps more consistently and thoroughly than any time before or since. In Robert Smithson: Learning from New Jersey and Elsewhere, Ann Reynolds elucidates the complexity of Smithson's work and thought by placing them in their historical context, a context greatly enhanced by the vast archival materials that Smithson's widow, Nancy Holt, donated to the Archives of American Art in 1987. The archive provides Reynolds with the remnants of Smithson's working life - magazines, postcards from other artists, notebooks, and perhaps most important, his library - from which she reconstructs the physical and conceptual world that Smithson inhabited. Reynolds explores the relation of Smithson's art-making, thinking about art-making, writing, and interaction with other artists to the articulated ideology and discreet assumptions that determined the parameters of artistic practice of the time."--BOOK JACKET.
A collaboration with nature
Christo & Jeanne-Claude : verhülter Reichstag, Berlin, 1971-1995 : das Buch zum Projekt = wrapped Reichstag, Berlin, 1971-1995 = the project book
This book explores the influence of Mexican culture and tradition, La Casa Azul and other places Frida Kahlo called home, on her life and work. La Casa Azul, now one of the most visited museums in Mexico City, was the artist's birthplace and the home where she grew up, lived with her husband Diego Rivera for a number of years, and also where she died. She spent long periods of time in the house convalescing, first in 1918 when she contracted polio and again, at the age of 18, after the trolley accident which left her badly injured. Confined to her bed and in constant pain and discomfort, she began to paint as a way to occupy her time. After marrying Rivera, Frida moved out of the Blue House, living in Mexico and abroad, moving for a brief time to the United States, until eventually returning to her childhood home. Fully illustrated, the book features Frida's paintings together with archive images and family photographs, objects and artefacts she collected and photographs of the surrounding landscape to provide an insight into how these places shaped this much-loved artist and how the homes and landscapes of her life relate to her work.
Genius at crossroads : the new role of the 21st century artist
"This book is a follow-up to our steady seller Natural Architecture. Presenting all new work by twenty artists not featured in the first volume as well as new projects by a selection of artists discussed in the first edition, Natural Architecture Now will showcase extraordinary spaces and exceptional structures created using natural materials and manual labor. The works make direct reference to the world of nature in terms of their location, the materials used, and a minimum application of non-artisan techniques. These are beautiful structures that use the resources of place, the specific characteristics of the site, growth processes, and spontaneous and accidental phenomena to investigate our feelings about nature, while addressing ecology, landscape, and environment as belonging to art"--
