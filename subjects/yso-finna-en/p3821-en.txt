The purpose of this thesis was to study the effect of structural coating pigments on ink jet papers. The object was to examine the properties of the pigments and evaluate the given printing result. Pigment is the most important factor affecting the coating properties and different pigments give different properties. Ten structural coating pigments were used in this thesis. The target was to find one special coating pigment that could be utilized in paper manufacturing. Another target was to find an optimal coating mix and the correct amount of the pigment. The thesis contains confidential background material.
