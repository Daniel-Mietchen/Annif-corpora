The World Federation of the Deaf: A History is a large, colorful and beautifully designed book chronicling the world Deaf community and the national organizations of the Deaf around the globe. This far-reaching history highlights the achievements of Deaf people worldwide and also focuses on the advocacy efforts of member non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve human rights and the quality of life of Deaf citizens in their respective countries. This publication is an excellent educational and informational tool for use by national government officials, schools and individuals, that includes national organization background and current advocacy activities of the 127 affiliate member organizations of the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and more than 158 biographies of world leaders since the organization was established in Rome, Italy in 1951. The World Federation of the Deaf: A History includes summaries of 13 World Congresses of the World Federation of the Deaf.There are two special sections in the book, a four-color section depicting deaf national postal stamps from various countries around the world and a deaf international section that will briefly describe other international organizations of the deaf and their activities. Numerous photographs and other visuals are displayed throughout the book that enhance descriptions of the historical accomplishments and efforts of Deaf people who have worked together to improve the life of all Deaf people worldwide in nations throughout the world. "The Gannon's service and commitment to global Deaf community is immeasurable and priceless. This is a tremendous achievement. We couldn't thank them enough for their yeoman's work. We look forward to having this book change the world's perception of our community as an enlightened group of people who ask that our civil, human, and linguistic rights are respected," said NAD President Bobbie Beth Scoggins."We would like to thank everyone who was instrumental to bringing about the publication of this book, the WFD, Ordinary Members from all over the world, Gallaudet University, Gerald "Bummy" Burstein, the Laurent Clerc Cultural Fund (LCCF), and countless volunteers who pushed along this milestone." Writing this book has been a labor of love for author Jack R. Gannon. The idea was conceived in 1992 and became one of the most challenging and difficult projects ever undertaken by this experienced and well-known figure in the Deaf community. Gannon, a retired teacher and Gallaudet University administrator, is the author of two other books, Deaf Heritage, A Narrative History of Deaf America (also published by the NAD) and The Week the World Heard Gallaudet.^He is the curator of History Through Deaf Eyes, a national exhibition about the American Deaf community, which was developed at Gallaudet University and toured the United States and co-author of Through Deaf Eyes: A Photographic History of an American Community. My hope is that this book will become an important resource for Deaf people everywhere to better understand the remarkable efforts of our leaders who founded and sustained the WFD and our national organizations of the Deaf. At the same time this book can serve to enlighten those who are not deaf and share our struggle for human rights and the celebration of human difference, said Jack Gannon. The NAD and WFD believe that the Deaf community, their families and the professionals who work with them will learn more about the history of national Deaf associations worldwide and the importance of collaborative efforts among national and world organizations.This publication will also be an invaluable reference for students and other academics studying or researching the global Deaf community, and international policy and human rights issues.
