Environmental epidemiologist Morris chronicles the at times frightening story of our drinking water. He recounts the epidemics that have shaken cities and nations, the scientists who reached into the invisible and emerged with controversial truths that would save millions of lives, and the economic and political forces that opposed these researchers in a ferocious war of ideas. In the gritty world of nineteenth-century England, a physician proved that cholera could be hidden in a drop of water. In the twentieth century, burgeoning cities subdued cholera and typhoid by building massive filtration plants, and bubbling poisonous chlorine gas through their drinking water. However, in the new millennium, waterborne disease is threatening to reemerge, and research has linked chlorine treatment with cancer and stillbirths. Morris dispels notions of fail-safe water systems, revealing some shocking truths: miles of leaking water mains, constantly evolving microorganisms, and the looming threat of bioterrorism.--From publisher description.

"This book effectively combines the chemical, physical, biological and engineering principles of water disinfection in one text. Discussing both conventional and novel techniques used for disinfection and the economics involved, the book gives a comprehensive review of various physical, chemical, and hybrid techniques used for disinfection to create potable water, including mode of action, scale of operation, efficacy, merits, and drawbacks. The authors highlight their novel work on cavitation for water disinfection, an economical, energy efficient, and simple alternative to the conventional methods of disinfection"--

Water related diseases are one of the most common reasons for illnesses and even deaths. The most vulnerable groups are small children, as well as adults. The problem is not present only in developing countries but also in developed countries. The United Nations have set goals to halve the amount of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by the year 2015. This goal is to be reached and even exceeded at some parts of the world.  In this project, Improvement of Sustainable Water Safety Management and Participatory Planning in Azerbaijan Schools, the aim is to improve the water supply and quality of the drinking water together with the participation of the local people. Azerbaijan is a relatively young country and is still struggling with the history of Soviet Union and trying to build a sustainable infrastructure. During the past few years the environmental issues have become more important and the awareness has increased.  Water safety plan is a tool that can be used for identifying possible risk points in the water supply system and thus improve the safety and reliability. It can be used either for large scale water supply systems as well as in single wells in a small village. In this project the main focus is on children and the school education as the informative channel. Before the actual implementation of the water safety plan, it is important to find out the start point in the project, in this case with baseline survey that was conducted in two of the target villages in rural Azerbaijan. The baseline study showed that the two villages were very different from each other. The problems related to the sanitation were similar but the situation with the drinking water differed in the villages. The local people were aware of the poor quality of the drinking water and sanitation and they were willing to participate in possible improvements according to their ability.

Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.
