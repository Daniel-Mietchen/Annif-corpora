These conditions put pressure for the business managers as they should set goals for improving customer experience. Measuring without any goal is just a waste of resources. Theoretical background was gathered during the autumn 2015, as customer experience is widely researched topic, the problem was to choose the most beneficial data. The empirical part of this study was conducted by using different qualitative methods, such as theme interviews conducted for the customers and for the employees of the case company. In addition, NPS survey conducted by a third party was included in the research process. The collected data was analyzed and compared with the findings from the theory. Different research methods gave an opportunity for finding relevant data and also a chance to see the reasons behind different factors and results. Due to confidential data, results from the NPS questionnaire are marked as confidential.

Today, competitive advantage cannot be gained through improving the products or lowering the prices. Advantage over the competitors must be searched from new sources, for example by focusing on customer experience. In addition the value created in the past, can be important when the customer is making the purchasing decision in the future. The changes in the consumer's wants and needs are driving companies to make changes in their business strategy. Concept of customer experience refers to finding out the needs of the customer; in order to gain competitive advantage. In addition, focusing on negative impressions is important, as people tend to share their experiences to their friends and family  this makes customer experience a marketing tool. Focusing on different aspects of customer experience is important, as customers should be the core of the business  without the customers there is no need for the company. Companies should focus on developing customer experience in order to make the customer do transactions in the future as well. The topic for this bachelor's thesis was given by the case company; Limingan Osuuspankki. During my internship, the case company wanted to conduct a research focusing on customer experience as the case company wanted to focus on develop in creating experiences for the customers. As the case company had no previous experience on the topic, the goal of this research was to find out what kind of customer experience does the customers of the case company have and to find suggestions for developing it. This study focused on different aspects of customer experience, for example - how it is created and how it can be measured. All in all, developing customer experience is dependent on many different factors. Different tools for measuring customer experience, give only one viewpoint into phenomena. ^

Marketing in todays society has gone to a level in which the act of selling is causing resentment among the public. We are at a stage where traditional printed advertising has lost its strength and digital marketing has taken over; raising the stakes. In between all this, most companies have failed to analyze their existing clientele, thus improving their up-to-date knowledge on the target group and aiming the marketing to the proper customer segments. The case company, Liikuntakeskus Voitto Ltd., is a recently founded health and fitness center located in Limingantulli, Oulu. The topic for this thesis originated from the owners of the company; wishing to examine its clientele in order to gain detailed knowledge on the current target group and to readjust the marketing if necessary. The objective was to determine what type of customer groups Liikuntakeskus Voitto is formed of and how they can be reached in terms of marketing communication. This thesis also aimed to uncover the questions on how the customers had initiated first contact with the case company and what were the main reasons to join. Quantitative research method was used in gathering the data for the empirical part of the thesis. The research itself was conducted as a questionnaire; as a traditional paper form and an online survey. Closed questions were used for the most part to gain coherent and comparable answers. However, the questionnaire included also a few open-ended questions allowing the customers to give direct feedback on the services to the client company. The theoretical part of the thesis was based on printed and online material. The results were presented to the management of the client company and the necessary action was taken in accordance with the results. The main customer segments and their characteristics were identified, revealing the potential development area in marketing. ^

The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: Who is the audience when a company is sharing information in social media? Is it only the friends of owners and workers, old clients, or is there a chance to obtain new clients and business contacts through these media? Another problem to be addressed is the question of what types of information or content a media agency should produce and share that would attract potential clients. This thesis is a case study and the case company is a small Out Of Home Media planning and buying agency called MacDonald Media, located in the United States. The theoretical part of this thesis concentrates on the different forms of Social Media, how the Internet has changed from a marketing point of view, and what kinds of previous research have been conducted on this subject. Other important elements include discussing what makes Business-to-Business more challenging for Social Media marketing and why personal sales are extremely important for B-to-B. The research portion of this thesis consists of qualitative research based on e-mail interviews with MacDonald Media's West Coast GM Rick Robinson and a phone interview with Johanna Janhonen, a Finnish Social Media specialist. My own observations during an internship with MacDonald Media have also influenced the research section. When analyzing the data, I tried to find connections between these two interviews to answer the research problem and to discover how companies were already using Social Media. I also tried to find connections between these interviews and my theoretical conclusions, e.g. that Social Media marketing is not as simple for B-to-B as it is for B-to-C companies. The results show that it is difficult for B-to-B companies to directly find new client contacts through Social Media. Though there are advantages, including an improved ease to connect people, share knowledge and information, and build and protect a company brand. LinkedIn and Twitter appear to be the best forums for a Business-to-Business company like MacDonald Media to be visible in the online world.
The objective of this thesis is to assess and measure the level of satisfaction of the internal business travel customers at Finnair Plc. The internal business travel services are provided by the Travel Management unit within the organisation. Its internal business travel customers are the departments and subsidiaries of the Finnair Group. The study was aimed at the representatives of the internal business travel customers rather than the entire departments as a whole. The internal business travel services at Finnair are mainly self-service by nature. The managers of the Travel Management unit negotiate agreements with business travel service suppliers and the agreements are placed on the company's intranet. Booking services are not part of the internal business travel services. The only exceptions to this are flight reservations and ticketing that are provided by the Staff Travel Office operating within the Travel Management unit. Theoretical framework of the thesis is focused on customer satisfaction and service quality. These two themes are by no means new and plenty of previous research is available on them. This thesis employs the service quality dimensions of SERVQUAL and the Gaps Model of Service Quality as the main theories for the research. The contextual framework deals with Travel Management processes and concepts. The empirical research was conducted by using a quantitative method. The study was carried out by a questionnaire which was given to the representatives of internal business travel customers in person during a meeting. Those not present in the meeting received the questionnaire by internal mail afterwards. The questionnaire had eight sections designed according to the internal business travel services offered by the Travel Management unit of Finnair. Each section also had an open-ended comment possibility. The eighth section was left entirely for additional feedback and comments. The total amount of the sample was 42 and the response rate was 59.52%. The results of the questionnaire indicate that currently the overall level of satisfaction among the departments using the internal business travel services of the Travel Management unit is quite high, yet not excellent. The importance of providing excellent service to internal customers needs to be enforced better within the Travel Management unit, especially to the service personnel that are in contact with the representatives of the internal business travel customers.
