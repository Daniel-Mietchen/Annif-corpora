Zen and the art of the Internet : a beginner's guide
The vast, international web of computer networks that is the Internet offers millions of users the opportunity to exchange electronic mail, photographs and sound clips, to search databases for books, CDs, cars and term papers, to participate in real-time audio- and video-conferencing and to shop for products both virtual and physical. This conglomerate of links, hyperlinks and virtual links is not just a technology for computers - it is a medium for communication. The convergence of computer and communication technologies creates a social convergence as well. People meet in chat rooms and discussion groups to converse on everything from auto mechanics to post-modern art. Networked groups form virtually and on-the-fly, as common interests dictate. Like interpersonal communication, the networks are participatory, their content made up by the audience and like mass-mediated communication, they involve large audiences. But the networks are neither purely interpersonal nor purely mass. This book addresses the mutual influences between information technology and group formation development, to assess the impact of computer-mediated communications on both work and play. Areas discussed include the growth and features of the Internet, network norms and experiences and the essential nature of network communication.
