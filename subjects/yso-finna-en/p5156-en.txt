The objective is to measure direct and indirect competitors’ operating strategies, in order to evaluate their performance and make comparisons. The results are essential information for Coyoacán restaurant that will open on November 2014 on the street of Hallituskatu number 27. The 5 companies chosen represent the median values of all the competitors under a 93.75% certainty. The chosen “Subjects of Study” are: 1) Burgeribaari Kauppuri 5 (Bar & Grill Kauppuri 5 Oy) Fast-Food/Bar 2) Fit Wok (The Wokers Oy) 3) Indian Cuisine (Katiusa Oy) 4) Kiinalainen Ravintola Flavour Palace (Suo Zi Oy) 5) Tuba Food & Lounge (Oulu Tours Gorup Oy) Fast-Food/Bar Two “Subjects of Study” represent the Fast-Food/Bar business model, which is a trend of business model that many restaurants and bars are adopting, and they seem to be as well the most successful restaurants in Oulu city center area. Information is collected throughout two main sources researched, interviews and observation. First and second hand sources such as interviews, printed and online materials. All data gathered is spread into two main categories: The Marketing Mix 4 p’s and Jim Collin’s framework. With a 93.75% of certainty this research found out that the Business Model of the Fast-Food/Bar is the most efficient. The sales of alcohol, customer service features and logistics result in highly performance numbers. Subjects of study that fit with this business model are close to tripling the Net Sales of year 2013 in comparison to the rest of the companies. There is no evidence that necessarily hamburgers and beer is the key for success. However it is interesting to point-out that there is still not a Fast-Food/Bar in Oulu that wisely uses the same business model and presents a different menu with interesting and new ideas.

A major dilemma for businesses has been the struggle to understand how to adopt and implement proactive environmental practices while meeting the core business objectives of growth and competitive advantage. The international contributors - leading scholars in the field of environmental strategy and management - shed light on this difficult balance as they examine the generation and deployment of capabilities, processes, and routines that help a business develop advanced environmental practices while simultaneously lowering costs and creating differentiation benefits.
Success in solution business starts by accepting that solution business is a separate business model, not simply another product category or an extension of the existing product business. This book identifies the business model areas that firms need to focus on when transforming into solution business. It further organizes these areas into three sets of capabilities and practices: commercialization, industrialization, and solution platforms. Commercialization refers to a firm’s ability to understand customers’ value-creating processes and to create solutions that enable improved value creation for customers. It also refers to a firm’s ability to sell the solutions and to receive compensation based on customers’ value-in-use. Industrialization refers to a firm’s ability to standardize the solution in order to create repeatability and scalability.To support repeatability, firms need to develop common processes so that the solutions can be efficiently replicated across regions and time. A solution platform creates the necessary support for an effective solution-business process. The platform consists of subsets of capabilities related to strategic management, management systems, infrastructure support, and human resources. Solution Business: Building a Platform for Organic Growth is the first book to take a comprehensive view of success in solution business, and its relevance therefore extends to all functions of firms wanting to become solution providers. It offers advice for strategy planning, business development, research and development, marketing, sales, supply chain management, operations, finance, planning and control, legal matters, and human resources management. The book is also relevant on many managerial levels. For top management, it provides the agenda for transformation.For functional heads, it illustrates the capabilities that each function needs to develop. For business-unit heads, it shows the areas prone to conflict during the transition towards solution business. And for middle management, it offers a language with which to discuss solution business across functions and regions. The book will also help you self-assess how ready your organization is for success in solution business.

The realisation process of entrepreneurial strategies
In Strategy: A History, Sir Lawrence Freedman captures the vast history of strategic thinking, how strategy came to pervade every aspect of our lives. The range of Freedman's narrative is moving from the advanced strategy practiced in primate groups, to the opposing strategies of Achilles and Odysseus in The Iliad, the strategic advice of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, the great military innovations of Baron Henri de Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz, the grounding of revolutionary strategy in class struggles by Marx, the insights into corporate strategy found in Peter Drucker and Alfred Sloan, and the contributions of the leading social scientists working on strategy today. The core issue at the heart of strategy, the author notes, is whether it is possible to manipulate and shape our environment rather than simply become the victim of forces beyond one's control. Time and again, Freedman demonstrates that the inherent unpredictability of this environment-subject to chance events, the efforts of opponents, the missteps of friends-provides strategy with its challenge and its drama. Armies or corporations or nations rarely move from one predictable state of affairs to another, but instead feel their way through a series of states, each one not quite what was anticipated, requiring a reappraisal of the original strategy, including its ultimate objective. Thus the picture of strategy that emerges in this book is one that is fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point, not the end point.

The objective of this Bachelor  ́s thesis was to produce a feasible business plan for a cake bakery in Helsinki. The end users of project outcome, the business plan, are one of the authors with another HAAGA-HELIA graduate. The plan is also a tool for the end users for assessing the personal readiness for becoming an entrepreneur as well as for assessing the business idea and the operational plan. Second, the plan is needed to prove that the business idea is viable and to obtain financial resources. The aim is to utilize the plan and to start the business by the end of year 2010. The theoretical framework of this thesis is about entrepreneurship, business planning in perspective of starting a new business, and project management. The focus is in business plan and its content. The theory for project management supported the planning and implementation of the project. The project implementation began with the business plan development, which started with the information gained in the Entrepreneurship information session given by EnterpriseHelsinki. Business plan was written according to the EnterpriseHelsinki business and the research was done by using secondary data. The project was successfully completed on March 29th. The business plan suggested that there is a realistic opportunity for a profitable cake bakery business in Töölö, Helsinki. Finally, the business plan was reviewed and analysed by an Enterprise Helsinki business advisor. The advisor evaluated the coherence of the business idea, its profitability and realism. After the evaluation the advisor gave his recommendation on further action. According to the business advisor evaluation, the business plan contains sufficient information for applying for a loan from Finnvera. KultaKakku  ́s vision for the next five years after the start-up is to become a supplier of cakes and bakery goods for local restaurants, coffee houses, grocers and catering. The founders of KultaKakku also see the possibilities to open other cake shops in different areas of Helsinki.
