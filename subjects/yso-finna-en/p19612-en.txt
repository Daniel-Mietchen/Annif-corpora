The aim of this thesis is to study the Finnish alcohol policy and its effects on the development of cafes from 1950s to 2005. The topic was chosen as both the alcohol policy and cafes have experienced rapid development during the past years, and it thus interesting to study how these phenomena have interacted during a longer period of time. The study is divided into 4 themes that approach the research topic from different points of view: firstly, the general development of the state alcohol policy is discussed, after which the discussion goes one step deeper and presents the practical outcomes of the alcohol policy when it comes to the daily operations of a caf.̌ After this, the research takes a slightly different point of view and discusses the general development of cafš themselves. Finally, the fourth theme concentrates on investigating the issue of alcohol in cafes. In the study, it was found out that alcohol played most important role in cafes in the 1970s, after the 1969 liberalisation of the alcohol legislation. Medium beer was taken into selection in most cafes who when that time facing serious economic difficulties. Beer kept many an establishment alive, but also changed the operations so much that the status of a caf ̌was in many cases lost. The situation today is very much different as many cafes have acquired A-licenses as early as 1990s when the state alcohol monopoly liberalised its licensing policy considerably. This has not however changed the image of cafes nor affected their economy as much as the introduction of medium in 1969, and thus even the recent considerable changes in the alcohol taxation have not affected alcohol sales in cafes that much.  During those 55 years that have been studied in this paper alcohol has not played any major role in cafes if not taking into account medium beer in the 1970s. It could even be said that the lack of alcohol in cafes has influenced them more, especially during the early parts of the period under study. However, in the future alcohol might gain a stronger foot step in certain type of cafes.

Prohibition has long been portrayed as a 'noble experiment' that failed, a newsreel story of glamorous gangsters, flappers, and speakeasies. Now at last Lisa McGirr dismantles this cherished myth to reveal a much more significant history. Prohibition was the seedbed for a pivotal expansion of the federal government, the genesis of our contemporary penal state. Her deeply researched, eye-opening account uncovers patterns of enforcement still familiar today: the war on alcohol was waged disproportionately in African American, immigrant, and poor white communities. Alongside Jim Crow and other discriminatory laws, Prohibition brought coercion into everyday life and even into private homes. Its targets coalesced into an electoral base of urban, working-class voters that propelled FDR to the White House. This outstanding history also reveals a new genome for the activist American state, one that shows the DNA of the right as well as the left. It was Herbert Hoover who built the extensive penal apparatus used by the federal government to combat the crime spawned by Prohibition. The subsequent federal wars on crime, on drugs, and on terror all display the inheritances of the war on alcohol. McGirr shows the powerful American state to be a bipartisan creation, a legacy not only of the New Deal and the Great Society but also of Prohibition and its progeny.
