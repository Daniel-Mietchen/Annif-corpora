The aim of this thesis was to prepare polyelectrolyte thin films by spin coating and to determine the surface free energy of the films. The surface free energy was calculated by means of contact angle measurements. The studied polyelectrolytes have applications such as organic solar cells and organic light emitting diodes. Surface free energy is related to the integrity of the thin film laminate structures used in various applications. Thin films were prepared on a glass substrate whose surface was activated by plasma treatment followed by a spin coating procedure. Thin films were prepared of four different polyelectrolytes (PIMa, PIMb, PT1 and PT2), each in two different dissolutions: water and water-dioxane (50:50 v:v). The films were thermally annealed before the contact angle measurements. For contact angle measurement, four different probe liquids were used, namely glycerol, formamide, ethylene glycol, and diiodomethane. Surface free energy and its polar and dispersive components were calculated based on the contact angle measurements. Glass slides without any polymer film, treated with water and water-dioxane, were used as blanks. Thin film height profile was measured by atomic force microscopy after scratching the surface. The obtained results show that methods for surface free energy determination by contact angle measurement are not standardized and there are several details to consider for successful measurement.
