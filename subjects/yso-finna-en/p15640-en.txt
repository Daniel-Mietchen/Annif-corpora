The essays in this book provide an excellent introduction to the means by which scientists convey their ideas. While diverse in their subject matter, the essays are unified in asserting that scientists compose and use particular representations in contextually organized and contextually sensitive ways, and that these representations - particularly visual displays such as graphs, diagrams, photographs, and drawings - depend for their meaning on the complex activities in which they are situated.The topics include sociological orientations to representational practice, representation and the realist-constructivist controversy, the fixation of evidence, time and documents in researcher interaction, selection and mathematization in the visual documentation of objects in the life sciences, the use of illustrations in texts (E.0. Wilson's Sociobiology, a field guide to the birds), representing practice in cognitive science, the iconography of scientific texts, and semiotic analysis of scientific, representation.

User engagement has become a key part of discussions about the nature and purpose of social science research. In this book the authors provide an authoritative overview of recent theoretical and practical developments relating to working with users at different stages in the processes of research. The book draws primarily on issues, examples and frameworks that have arisen specifically within educational research. The implications of different forms of user engagement for the design of educational research are explored in detail. By examining the researcher-user interface and evaluating inputs from academics, practitioners, policy-makers and those involved in the mediation of research evidence the book gives a new synthesis that will provide a coherent way forward for research collaborations in the future. The authors focus on: conceptualising different approaches, purposes and interpretations of user engagement emphasising the relationship between user engagement and research design providing examples of effective user engagement within different research genres identifying the capacity building implications for researchers and research mediators.

"How can educational research have more impact? What processes of knowledge exchange are most effective for increasing the uses of research results? How can research-produced knowledge be better 'mobilized' among users such as practicing educators, policy makers, and the public communities? These sorts of questions are commanding urgent attention in global educational discourses and research policies. This attention has been translated into powerful material that shapes what is now considered to be worthwhile research. It directly affects how research is funded, recognized, and assessed. Yet precisely what activities constitute effective knowledge mobilization, or even what is meant by 'moving knowledge', remains unclear. Knowledge Mobilization explores - what politics are at play in determining knowledge 'impact' across radically different contexts? - who determines what counts as impact, and for what purposes? - how are 'results' of educational research separated from its participants and processes? - how are languages used in the construction of knowledge, the enactment of policy processes and the ways in which research unfold. This volume is unique in bringing together these wide-ranging issues of knowledge mobilization in education. The volume editors critically analyse these complex issues and also describe various efforts of knowledge mobilization and their effects. The contributors in Knowledge Mobilization speak from diverse occupational and theoretical locations. Leading scholars in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia bring disciplinary perspectives from law, digital media studies, museum studies, journalism and policy-making as well as fields of education"--

This paper considers the effect of income on the risk of having the first births in Sweden from 1968 to 2009. Variations by gender are given particular atention. The study follows men and women from the moment they turn 18 until they enter parenthood and it is based on register-based data covering the entire population of Sweden. Complementary log-log models show that there is a positive association between income and the risk of childbearing. The association gets stronger over time and the differences between men and women diminish. Gender differences appear when the income effect is related to the demand for work in the economy. An income above the median does not increase the risk of childbearing for women when the demand for work is relatively high.
