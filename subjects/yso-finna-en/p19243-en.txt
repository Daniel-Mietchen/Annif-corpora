The latest spice simulation and design tools for creating state-of-the-art switching power supplies. Fully updated to incorporate new SPICE features and capabilities, this practical guide explains, step by step, how to simulate, test, and improve switch-mode power supply designs. Detailed formulas with founding equations are included. Based on the author's continued research and in-depth, hands-on work in the field, this revised resource offers a collection of the latest SPICE solutions to the most difficult problem facing power supply designers: creating smaller, more heat-efficient power supplies in shorter design cycles.
