Motivation structure of end-user application developers in organisational learning
Headlines of daily newspapers announce that 90% of all German employees do not feel satisfied  at work. This statement contradicts with the increasing importance of innovative and motivated  people that are needed by modern companies. Technological modernization and automation lead  to global competition and growing challenges for all companies being part of the international  economic system. These developments hide the request for unique and personalized services that  have to be designed for demanding customers by employees being proactive problem-solvers.  Combining the corporate success with employee's satisfaction is seen as the modern challenge for  HR Managers during the 21st century and defines the focus of this thesis report.  The search for an answer firstly lead to the investigation of various theories on basic human  needs and demonstrated the development of corresponding motivational methods towards a  more intangible approach called intrinsic motivation. Nowadays employees demand different  rewards from work than 20 years ago. The growth of the service industry has been the release for  testing the need for a modernized motivational model at hotels belonging to that sector.  Aiming to examine the sustainable impact of intrinsic motivation, the empirical research tested  the current satisfaction level and rewarding preferences from staff members belonging to  different hierarchical levels of a 5-star luxury hotel. Consequently the openness of modern staff  for new motivational models was spotted and starting points for the method's implementation  could be identified. People stressed their tendency towards intangible motivators but never forgot  to mention financial security. Findings from empirical research also revealed the request for a  motivational model stimulating people's ability to realize their full potential and express their  personality by simultaneously benefiting the corporate success. This desire stresses career  supporting opportunities and support for cross-departmental communication.  Finally, the combination of literature review findings and empirical results formed the fundament  for creating innovative implications for future managers who try to benefit the company as well  as their staff members. The establishment of a model that revives people's passion for  performing a job and intends to direct people's attention towards intrinsic motivators  constituting one step towards a long-term motivation. On the basis of ensuring a fair salary the  new strategy tries to deflect people's focus on monetary reward by stressing personal growth  potential.

This volume focuses on the role of motivational processes - such as goals, attributions, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, self-concept, self-esteem, social comparisons, emotions, values, and self-evaluations - in self-regulated learning. It provides theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the role of motivation in self-regulated learning, and discusses detailed applications of the principles of motivation and self-regulation in educational contexts. Each chapter includes a description of the motivational variables, the theoretical rationale for their importance, research evidence to support their role in self-regulation, suggestions for ways to incorporate motivational variables into learning contexts to foster self-regulatory skill development, and achievement outcomes.

"A free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere: this is the goal of the Khan Academy, a passion project that grew from an ex-hedge funder's online tutoring sessions with his niece, who was struggling with algebra, into a worldwide phenomenon. Today, millions have viewed and subscribed to the Khan Academy's YouTube videos, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject. Like all great innovators, Sal Khan established himself as an outsider, with no teaching background to tie him to broken models. And his breakthrough idea has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this new approach to learning. In The One World Schoolhouse, Khan will present his remarkable story, as well as his vision for the future of education. More than just a solution, his book serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how his simple - yet revolutionary - method can help achieve this inspiring goal"--

Haaga Future Leaders Club is an optional addition to student's curriculum in Haaga. Its fundamental purpose is to facilitate the learning of its members. HFLC's main activities are project assignments from the industry, representation in competitions and events as well as supportive functions such as coaching and mentoring. Haaga Future Leaders Club was formed in December 2009 and the first meeting was held on January 15, 2010. First year of operations revealed challenges which were interpreted as deriving from the lack of organizational structures which resulted in poor organizational culture and perceived lowered motivation of the members. Despite the challenges, the pilot was seen successful and interpreted as being in need for further studying. The primary object of the thesis is to organize a workshop to collect material for a Member's guide leaflet. The Member's guide to be used as a facilitator for Haaga Future Leaders Club's operations and to clarify its identity and start building the self-directed organizational structure. The thesis is project-oriented with two interdependent products: 1) Workshop, where the material for the Member's guide is created, and the 2) Member's guide itself. The workshop stands as a starting point for the change process in Haaga Future Leaders Club, which is expected to lead to imcreased self-direction and subsequently to continuity and the development of the group. The theoretic background is based on a combination of learning and leadership. Two main theories are transformative learning and transformational leadership. The thesis was completed during the spring 2011. The goal of the thesis was reached as the workshop provided material for Haaga Future Leaders Club - Member's guide and started the change process. The outcome of the change process is to be evaluated in future. Did the thesis influence the organizational culture and practices of Haaga Future Leaders Club?

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined as the strategic pursuit of academic goals that involves the control over thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. This notion is taken for granted as a form of empowerment and as a form of engagement that good teachers will foster. This book is about exploring different sides to this story. It first proposes a framework for critically examining dominant and taken-for-granted ideas in educational psychology, then applies that framework to the examination of SRL to show how it endorses middle-class conventions, aligns with neoliberal logic, and renders individuals subordinate to oppressive educational structures. The book is a critique that is not necessarily intended to lead to the rejection of SRL, but rather to invite teachers, researchers, and policymakers to reflect on the possible consequences and ethics of taking up the aim to institutionalize SRL.

Developing Self-regulating Learners was written as a resource for any educator interested in learning more about self-regulated learning (SRL) and how to support the development of self-regulating learners. It is also an ideal text for Teacher Education and graduate-level courses in educational psychology, special education, and classroom practice. The book is organized into three parts: Part One presents ‚Äúportraits of SRL‚Äù that help educators define self-regulated learning, consider why fostering SRL is so important, and see relationships between SRL, social-emotional learning, and executive functioning. Part Two describes and illustrates SRL‚Äîpromoting practices. Chapters in this section describe: how educators can establish safe and supportive learning environments that foster rich forms of learning and SRL; key guidelines educators can follow when building SRL-promoting practices; how educators can design activities and tasks that create opportunities for rich forms of learning and self- regulation; how educators can weave explicit supports for SRL into environments and activities; and how educators can structure assessments and feedback to inform and empower learning. Part Three pulls together ideas presented in Parts One and Two, giving rich case examples of how and why supporting SRL can assist educators in: meeting the needs of diverse students; motivating and empowering learners; and, ultimately, empowering 21st-century learning. Overall, this book will assist preservice and inservice educators in connecting research on self-regulation to learning in classrooms, and in effectively linking theoretical content with practical classroom applications and strategies.
