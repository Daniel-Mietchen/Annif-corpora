The topic of this thesis was offered by Mypose Oy, a startup company based in Oulu, Finland. Their primary products are impressive photo machines, which can be utilized by businesses to transform customers into brand ambassadors in social media. As the company has been expanding its business, there was a requirement to improve their analytics system, so that statistical insights of marketing campaigns using Mypose machines would be delivered to customer quickly and punctually. The thesis was divided into two distinct parts, in which the first one focused on the fundamental concepts of social media and social marketing, as well as the methods to identify, collect and aggregate metrics on social networks in order to calculate useful key performance indicators (KPIs). It also included studies about the values of email in modern marketing strategies, and methods to measure email effectiveness. The second part involved designing a new analytics system. It included examining different flows of Mypose photos to identify possible metrics, and determining proper methods to collect and compute KPIs based on accumulated statistical values. Additionally, a brief database modification and user interface designs for the new system were also discussed. The final result was the prototype of a new analytics system that was rich of functionalities, comprehensively visualized and easy to extend. Various parts of the outcome were developed and functioned in production during the course of writing this thesis. It also exposed some concerns about further development of the system.
