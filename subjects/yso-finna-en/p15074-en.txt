"Building with wood is currently enjoying a comeback. The reasons for the return of this ancient construction material are manifold. More than just being a renewable material that stores the carbon dioxide so damaging to the climate, it also has excellent structural properties, creates an ideal interior climate, and is easily combined with all other common building materials. The diverse applications can draw on expertise with wooden structures gained over centuries plus current research into modern timber engineering. Significant new developments in this specialist discipline have been seen in recent decades, especially in the German-speaking countries. The twenty-four international projects in this book outline the diversity now possible in contemporary timber construction and highlight the advantages of wood over conventional forms of building. Texts, photographs, and drawings reveal both the architectural and engineering qualities of these modern timber structures - from design concepts to load-bearing aspects to design"--Back cover
