Abstract (in Finnish).
Port Canaveral to create a new ultra-modern fire training ship
Wooden houses are still being erected in Finland - even high-rises                                                                                                            .
Summary.
The sub-marine world of the Oasis-class
International Maritime Organization has determined an international safety regulation (Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea). All the ships have to fulfill the safety criteria defined in this regulation. IMO has also added an alternative method of calculating the fire load of a ship. These two regulations determine in different ways how the fire load calculation should be performed and which issues should be taken into consideration. The methods differ so that a fire load is calculated based on either released amount of energy (MJ) or weight of materials (kg). Both of these methods are valid and therefore the purpose of this thesis is to research which method is more appropriate on this example vessel. The example vessel in the thesis is an ice breaking archipelago cruise ship built in Finland, which operates in the archipelago of Sweden around the year. The thesis presents the ship̕s fire loads on certain areas (determined by classification authorities or the ship owner) and compares the results and regulation demands. Properties and suitability of different materials on ship building according to fire safety is also viewed. The thesis shows the fire load of each material used and their influence on the total sum of the fire load. Total amounts and fire loads of individual materials are determined in different ways in both regulations, and the thesis demonstrates fire load calculations in detail of one area considering both regulations. Because the calculations methods and issues taken into account are different, also the work loads differ between the two regulations. Work load using SOLAS regulations is approximately half of the work needed when using IMO regulations. The thesis presents also basic fire classification regulations in general because they have an effect on selecting materials. The materials have an effect on fire loads because they have different combustibility features. The objective was met as it was discovered that the example vessel meets the requirements according to SOLAS regulations. This thesis also shows that a fire load calculation is recommended to begin with SOLAS regulations because of the lesser work load. If the results would not meet the required criteria it would be suggested to calculate the fire loads also using IMO regulations.

Fire safety in timber buildings : technical guideline for Europe
Significant loss to business occurs through fires in the workplace. Whether large or small, fire causes personal suffering, damage to plant, equipment and buildings, and loss of business. Fire legislation has changed over the past few years, especially with the introduction of European Directives. New regulations mean that employers have to carry out fire risk assessment and then, as a result of their findings, put in place control measures to prevent loss of life. Fire Hazards in Industry has been designed to cover, in general terms, exactly what is required of employers.It is written in simple language and considers the basics of good fire safety management.^After reading Fire Hazards in Industry, any employer, safety professional or fire safety officer should be able to install a system for carrying out fire risk assessment.^In addition to sections relating to the legal aspects of fire prevention, the book explains the concepts of fire modelling, explosions and combustion reactions. There is also a section relating to common industry fire hazards and hazards associated with electrical equipment. Knowledge of all these topics would be required if a person were to attempt to carry out fire risk assessment. Throughout the book, past case histories are used to illustrate certain aspects of fire and the causes of fire. The cases used have all been published by the Health and Safety Executive as a result of their investigations.These include; Abbeystead, Frodingham steelworks, HMS Glasgow, BP Grangemouth and many more.^This book will be equally relevant to motor manufacturing as it is to the chemical industry.^There are many case studies included that deal with fire hazards that are found in general industry.Fire Hazards in Industry is suitable for those who have relatively limited experience in fire safety and therefore use it as part of their career and educational development, but also can be used as reference material for those experienced professionals who have fire safety included in their day to day responsibility.
