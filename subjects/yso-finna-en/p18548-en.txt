The topic Sales and Distribution Channels for the thesis was suggested by tutor teacher and after having meeting with commissioner of the company ValkeeOy the finalized topic was chosen to be Sales and Distribution Channels/ Trade Fairs for Healthcare Technology in Austria. The main purpose of the research was to find out possible and suitable sales and distribution channels, trade fair for healthcare technology for the company in order to sell the product to Austrian markets. The thesis consists of two major parts, which are Sales & Distribution Channels and Trade Fairs for Healthcare Technology. Secondary research method was selected for the thesis as required by the company. Going to Austria personally could be an impossible task to collect information about all the target companies. Internet sources were easy and relatively accessible to find out most recent information about the required research. The possible suitable sales and distribution channels/ trade fairs for healthcare technology were sorted through different categories for the product line of Valkee Oy. The contact information of suitable companies in Austria has been provided for the company to contact. With the research done it is expected that the case company will be able to find out new channels to sell and market their product in Austria and also get new business partners as well.
