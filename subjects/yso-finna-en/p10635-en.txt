The wedding dress
"From homespun to haute couture, the dresses worn by American brides in the first half of the twentieth century had myriad influences. In Bridal Fashion 1900--1950, living-history expert Kathleen York takes readers on an elegant journey back in time, marking the changes that economics, popular culture, and even politics have made to style over the years. Both brides-to-be looking for inspiration and nostalgia-seekers will enjoy this lavishly illustrated tour of an era that saw the average wedding evolve from a simple affair for a few family members into a dazzling, and often expensive, gala for hundreds of guests"-- From publisher.
