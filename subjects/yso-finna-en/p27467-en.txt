RFID
Optimizing processes with RFID and auto ID : fundamentals, problems and solutions, example applications
Automated data gathering for industrial production tracking
Automotive companies are facing a costly problem due to the lack of visibility on RTIs delivering auto components in the supply chains. In auto-industry, RTIs can be very expensive and there have been researches pointing out that auto-manufacturers spend huge amount of money annually to replace the lost and damaged RTIs. Nowadays, Radio Frequency Identification is a form of wireless identification technology used to uniquely enhance the accuracy of data collection and identification of items. Confidex, as the commissioner of this thesis, has been developing and manufacturing RFID products to improve significantly RTI management in automotive industry. Due to the fact there had not been such a comprehensive market study on the area and RFID applications have been developed at significantly fast pace, in this thesis an analysis of automotive industry returnable transport item management with RFID in the supply chain was conducted. The main goal is to provide commissioning company with better knowledge on the area in order to forecast the market needs and develop its RFID products. Both primary research such as in-depth interviews with companies and secondary research on published articles, company reports, company portfolios, etc. were utilized in this thesis. The collected data was analysed using thematic method. In automotive industry, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers expressed the necessity of better control over RTIs with RFID solution. It is evident there is very low existing usage of RFID in automotive RTI management. Apart from a few early RFID adopters, it is popular within automotive industry that companies have limited or no experience in using RFID in RTI management. However, positively there can be seen a tendency to approach the technology, to calculate the savings RFID would bring in reusable container management, to investigate the challenges, to test and even to expand RFID usage between parties in automotive supply chain. This creates much space and demand for RFID solution providers to offer products and services to improve RTI management process in automotive industry in the near future. Throughout the thesis, thesis writer presented some potential business cases in particular companies by means of RFID challenges and expectations revealed by the experts from those companies. Appendix 1, as confidential material of the thesis, has been excluded from the public report.
