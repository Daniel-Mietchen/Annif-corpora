To communicate effectively within groups and teams, we must understand our relationships with other members and how those relationships influence the tasks and activities that the groups and teams undertake. Communicating in Groups, Third Edition, emphasizes that all groups--decision-making and social--require members to successfully convey both relational and task messages. Author Joann Keyton points to the five key elements that define a group--size, interdependence, identity, goal, and structure--and demonstrates how group processes are facilitated or hindered by them. Using examples from field research on both task and social groups, Keyton depicts group interaction as it emerges through conversation. She provides frameworks for analyzing group interaction, recommendations for effective group practice, and numerous transcripts of authentic group communication that help to underscore the concepts. Thoroughly revised in this third edition, the book features new material on communication structures, group tasks and activities, communication competence, and decision making. Keyton includes updated literature reflecting recent communication and interdisciplinary group theory and research, and she also places more emphasis on gender and cultural diversity, stressing the need for students to consider the multiple ways in which diversity influences group interaction. Highlighting the important connection between task and relational messages in both task and social groups, Communicating in Groups, Third Edition, is ideal for undergraduate courses in group and team communication, as well as for management and business communication courses in group behavior and teamwork.

Scrum is an agile software development process. It is an iterative and incremental process using the empirical process control. The objective of the research is to investigate why Scrum is an ideal process for small teams. The 'idealness' of Scrum is investigated by looking at why Scrum is an effective software development process.    A short history of the agile development process shows us that formal Scrum process was identified in 1996.  The history and the Scrum process are explained in detail. The agile balanced scorecard was used to measure the effectiveness of Scrum in four areas: reliability, quality, value and velocity. Scrum was also shown to be better than traditional software process models, Extreme Programming and Rational Unified Process. The use of Scrum in the real world was also investigated based on interview results and current web results. Finally, we also have a peek into the future of Scrum; web scrumming.    It was concluded that Scrum is indeed an effective software development process and is an ideal process for small teams. The results of this thesis will be very helpful to any company wishing to do Scrum and I would definitely recommend Scrum as an ideal software process for small teams.
