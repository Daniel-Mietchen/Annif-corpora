Thesis comprises the development of Wärtsilä 46 common rail engine fuel injection system, focusing on the period from the first engine deliveries January 2001 to January 2005. The following main parts of the system are discussed: injection pump, injection valve, accumulator, HP and LP pressure pipes, return fuel and control oil systems. The thesis was made to describe changes made in the components and reasons for these modifications during the trajectory of this engine type. The development work has been ongoing during and after engine deliveries. All the time new information is gathered from the field experience on how to improve engines and optimize components characteristics. This test and learning experience is an important part of the development work.

Ford P2000 hydrogen engine design and vehicle development program
Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

"Co-authored by a renowned researcher in energy studies, this book discusses the production, distribution, and applications of alternative fuels with respect to different modes of transportation (land, sea, and aviation). Much of the emphasis is on applications of these fuels in internal combustion engines. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of engine combustion, including injection, spray, combustion, performance, and emissions. The book also highlights greenhouse gases (GHGs), in view of climate change and global warming"--
