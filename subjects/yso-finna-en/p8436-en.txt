Data collection and analysis of evacuation situations
In September 1939 nearly 400,000 children were evacuated from London, followed by many more from other cities in the UK. Many of them were unaccompanied, and for most it was the first time away from home and their parents. Yet this well-known disruption of childhood was a drop in the ocean compared to the effect of conflict on children throughout the world. Children have always been the victims of war, and this fascinating new history examines the effects of conflict on the Russian War Children during the Leningrad Siege, children in Germany during the Holocaust and the children in more recent conflicts in West Africa, among many others. Taking first-hand accounts from survivors, diaries and authentic war documents, this eye-opening history reflects the untold story of hundreds of thousands of children whose lives were affected by the horrors of war. It covers children in UK and overseas including Germany and the influence of the Hitler Youth, the movement of Finnish children to Sweden, children of the Leningrad Siege, Dutch collaborators, Vietnam War and present-day West Africa. It also uses first-hand accounts and diaries.

It's the Second World War and, with London becoming an increasingly dangerous place to live, the Lockwood children are whisked away to Heron Hall, to stay with their Uncle Peregrine in the countryside. But when they discover two strange boys hiding in a nearby derelict castle, the past and present collide. Can those in the present learn from the troubles of the past? Covering two dramatic periods in English history, The children of the King deals sensitively with themes such as loss, grief, family, friendships, war and power.
