learning objectives
This third edition explores the key practical and theoretical issues underpinning cross-curricular teaching and learning across the early years, primary education and lower secondary school. Combining findings from research and educational theory with examples of thought-provoking teaching in schools, this textbook discusses how high quality teaching across different curriculum areas can be planned, taught, assessed and used to encourage creative and deep learning experiences. Revised and updated to reflect current curriculum policy and contemporary research, this third edition includes: · Coverage of the 2014 National Curriculum in England and the implications for cross-curricular practice · More case studies from across the curriculum, from different age groups and exploring different aspects of teaching · Improved coverage of cross-curricular practice in the Early Years Foundation Stage.

Embodying advances in cognitive psychology since the publication of Bloom's taxonomy, this revision of that framework is designed to help teachers understand and implement standards-based curriculums as well as facilitate constructing and analyzing their own. A revision only in the sense that it builds on the original framework, it is a completely new manuscript in both text and organization. Its two-dimensional framework interrelates knowledge with the cognitive processes students use to gain and work with knowledge. Together, these define the goals, curriculum standards, and objectives students are expected to learn. The framework facilitates the exploration of curriculums from four perspectives-what is intended to be taught, how it is to be taught, how learning is to be assessed, and how well the intended aims, instruction and assessments are aligned for effective education. This "revisited" framework allows you to connect learning from all these perspectives.
