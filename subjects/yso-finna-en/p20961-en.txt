Mitochondria DNA variations are used in evolutionary genetics as markers of population history and geographical movement. Despite the popular use of the Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism in research, its mitochondrial DNA sequence variations are not known. Objection of this work is to find out what kind of mitochondrial DNA sequence variations is there to be found in PVM and PYR2 fruit fly lines.    Mitochondria DNAs from two Drosophila melanogaster wild type lines, PYR2 and PVM, were extracted using standard phenol: chloroform extraction and then amplified using Senger automatic DNA sequencing. The obtained sequences were compared with the Drosophila melanogaster Oregon-R sequence and with each other in order to find any sequence variation.    In this development project, while several sequence variations were confirmed in the PVM fly line, the mutations found in PYR2 were inconclusive since they could not be verified. The sequences obtained from this project are going to be integrated into a larger research project.
