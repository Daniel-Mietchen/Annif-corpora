"Every decision you make affects how people experience your library. Aaron Schmidt and Amanda Etches count some 19 touchpoints--website, email, furniture, parking lot, events, newsletters, to name a few. Three elements are to be useful, useable, and desirable. Like three legs of a stool, missing any one will take you down. This book looks at the major checkpoints for user experience in a library, offering guidance on every facet, why it's important and how to assess your library's current status" --
