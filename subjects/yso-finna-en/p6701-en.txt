Intended for use by the exporter involved in international sales, finance, shipping, and administration, or for those studying for academic or professional qualifications in international trade, The Handbook of International Trade and Finance provides a full explanation of the key finance areas of international trade – including risk management, international payments and currency management. At the same time, it provides the essential information necessary to help reduce risks and improve cash flow. This fourth edition also describes the negotiating process from the perspective of both the buyer and the seller and covers trade risks and risk assessment, structured trade finance, methods and terms of payment, currency risk management and bonds, and standby letters of credit. It also has new examples, revised and updated regulations from the International Chamber of Commerce, and updated references and statistics.
