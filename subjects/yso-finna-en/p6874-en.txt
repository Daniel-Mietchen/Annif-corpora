Abstract.
Bullying, victimization, and peer harassment : a handbook of prevention and intervention
"Responding to disruptive or troubled pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) remains a highly topical issue. The challenges these children present relate to wider issues of continuing political concern: the perceived declining discipline in schools; school and social exclusion; the limits to inclusion for children with special needs; increasing mental health difficulties in children; youth crime and parenting skills. This topical and exhaustively-researched Companion examines the difficulties of defining EBD, and the dangers of allocating this imprecise label to children. Bringing together the work of contributors from fifteen countries and across four continents, this book features the research of leading experts in the global field of EBD, who discuss and debate educators' key concerns by: - looking at the overlaps between EBD, ADHD and mental health difficulties; - outlining the types of appropriate schooling for children with EBD; - urging readers to look beyond pupils' challenging behaviour in order to understand and respond to the social, biological and psychological causation; - considering the key areas of assessment, whole-school and targeted approaches that help pupils with EBD in mainstream and in special settings; - outlining helpful work with families, the crucial contribution of effective multi-agency working and the importance of supporting and developing teachers who work with challenging pupils. Containing contrasting views on controversial topics, this Companion's approachable style makes it an essential reference book for academics, policy makers, practitioners, educators and students who are working towards a higher degree in education"--

"Since the first edition was published in 1988, the role of crisis intervention and prevention has become central to mental health professionals working in the schools. Disasters such as hurricane Katrina, terrorist attacks both in this country and around the world, and various school shootings have greatly increased school crisis research and policy development. This book is designed for an introductory graduate course taken by students in school psychology, school counseling, and school social work. Section I provides a crisis response overview, section II deals with crises for children and adolescents and section III covers crises that manifest in adolescence. Discussions of the 16 most prevalent types of crises are covered in sections II and III and include their characteristics, causes, interventions, and preventive programs. All chapters will be updated, six heavily revised or totally rewritten by new authors, and two new chapters (chapters 8 & 19) have been added. "--

This authoritative volume provides state-of-the-art practices for supporting the approximately 20% of today's K/n-/12 students who have emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) that hinder school success. Leading experts present evidence-based approaches to screening, progress monitoring, intervention, and instruction within a multi-tiered framework. Coverage encompasses everything from early intervention and prevention to applications for high-risk adolescents. Exemplary programs are described for broad populations of EBD students as well as those with particular disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and externalizing behavior problems. The book combines theory and research with practical information on how to select interventions and implement them with integrity.
