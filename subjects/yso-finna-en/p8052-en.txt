Long walk to freedom
Gay and lesbian liberation as a sexual freedom movement, as a political movement, and as a movement of ideas - historical roots, legal issues and links with other movements. The author emphasises the role of women.
Woman's Estate is a compilation of several essays written by Juliet Mitchell in the late 1960's and in 1970, combined with new material that both connects the older essays and elaborates upon the implications of Mitchell's arguments. Mitchell describes the women's liberation movement (the term she uses to designate the most progressive wing of the women's movement) as the vanguard of radical political activism in the late 1960's. She likewise sees it as the key element in a new revolutionary political movement.
