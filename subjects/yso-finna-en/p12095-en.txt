Foundations in craniosacral biodynamics. Volume one, The breath of life and fundamental skills
"Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy (BCST) is commonly seen as the spiritual approach to craniosacral therapy (CST); in fact, BCST as taught by Franklyn Sills, the pioneer in the field, is quite different from conventional CST. Biodynamic work is based on the development of perceptual skills where the practitioner learns to become sensitive to subtle respiratory motions called primary respiration and also to the power of spontaneous healing. Through the Breath of Life, which, Sills asserts, echoes the Holy Spirit in the Judeo-Christian tradition, bodhicitta in Buddhism, and the Tai Chi in Taoism, students of BCST learn to enter a state of presence oriented to the client's inherent ability to heal. In Foundations in Craniosacral Biodynamics, Sills offers students and practitioners an in-depth, step-by-step guide to the development of perceptual and clinical skills with specific clinical exercises and explorations to help students and practitioners learn the essentials of a biodynamic approach. Individual chapters cover such topics as holism and biodynamics; mid-tide, Long Tide, Dynamic Stillness and stillpoint process; the motility of tissues and the central nervous system; transference and the shadow; shamanistic resonances; and more"--Provided by publisher.

A somatic approach to well-being, biodynamic craniosacral therapy (BCST) is known for its gentleness and effectiveness in treating a variety of traumas and imbalances. BCST teacher Franklyn Sills emphasizes the suspensory nature of the human system, reviewing and deepening our understanding of the "three bodies", the physical, the fluid, and the tidal. Sills focuses on the earliest phases of life--the embryonic period and the pre and perinatal experience--and includes chapters devoted to birth, birth dynamics, and craniosacral approaches that treat both birth trauma and the tissue patterns it generates. A truly practical manual, Volume two closes with important information on the neurophysiology of stress and trauma and related craniosacral and verbal skills.

"This clinically oriented textbook provides a patient-focused approach to the diagnosis and treatment of somatic dysfunction--functional impairment of the musculoskeletal system and related neural and vascular elements--in the context of family medicine practice. The book explains the clinical rationale for osteopathic manipulative treatment in specific situations and details procedures for treating common problems encountered in family medicine. Coverage begins with the philosophy and principles of osteopathic patient care. Two major sections focus on various patient populations and patients with various clinical conditions. A special section covers practice issues such as office set-up, progress notes, coding, and the standardized medical record."

Manipulation of the spine, thorax, and pelvis : an osteopathic perspective
"In 1929 Germany, physiotherapist Elisabeth Dicke suffered from poor circulation in her right leg, acute back pain, and a host of other ailments. With no medical options offered beyond amputation of the leg, she turned to her own training for help. She began to massage the skin and subcutaneous fascia of the sacral bone and pelvic crest with pulling strokes. After several applications, she experienced less back pain, increased circulation to the leg, and within three months, disappearance of all symptoms. This was the beginning of Dickes systematic, scientifically based treatment method of connective tissue massage (or Bindegewebsmassage), now in wide use throughout the world. In this book, practitioners will get the first detailed, how-to description of connective tissue massage (CTM) {in the English language} including the principles, knowledge, and skills to implement it. Special Features: Begins with the origin and practical benefits of CTM, including its neuroanatomical and neurophysiological basis, Explores the relationship between the sensory, motor, and autonomic nervous systems and the complex reflex mechanisms that are activated by CTM therapy, Describes and illustrates specific stroking techniques that trigger the appropriate neural reflexes in every body segment, Shows how to make a diagnostic assessment based on skin, connective tissue, and muscle zones, Covers the full range of orthopedic, neurological, internal medicine, and gynecologic disorders that can be effectively treated with CTM. Complete with treatment plans, indications and contraindications, and modern medical guidelines, this book is essential for all physical and massage therapists and osteopaths who want to successfully integrate CTM into their practices. It is also a fascinating reference for physicians and other medical professionals who are interested in learning more about this important manual technique.__"--Provided by publisher.
