"Furniture design has always reflected the style of the period. Currently, eclecticism is one the most important characteristics of design. Today, an intelligent combination of pieces, different in style, put together with good taste, creates more original rooms that are utterly charming. The greater the contrast, the more risque the bet and the more impressive the result. Classic furniture is the protagonist of this new trend combining shapes, textures and colors from different eras. Today you can find furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries in vintage or antique stores, or new editions from contemporary manufacturers. Whether original or re-make, the options are immense and can be found in this book offered as a source of inspiration to achieve customized, original and surprising interiors"--Back cover.
