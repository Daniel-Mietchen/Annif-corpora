This thesis examined hydrological processes such as snowmelt and groundwater discharge in drained peatland areas in the boreal zone. The studied processes were measured in situ using environmental tracers. Further, performance of a treatment wetland was studied during snowmelt and high flow. A GIS model was developed to estimate groundwater seepage areas in peatland systems surrounding eskers.It was found that soil frost had a clear impact on water quality during snowmelt. This was evident as lower suspended sediments, water colour and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, among other changes. The treatment wetland was found to reduce the suspended solids load during the snowmelt period and late autumn, while reductions in phosphorus and nitrogen loads occurred during summer. A sampling algorithm was built to test how different sampling frequencies affected the estimation of suspended solid loads from the constructed wetland. The results showed increasing uncertainty for sparser sampling (from weekly to monthly sampling), but the uncertainty remained high even at weekly sampling. The GIS model was tested on two eskers and shown to give a fair estimate of groundwater discharge locations. It can thus be used for improving aquifer protection in boreal eskers related to the drainage networks surrounding them. However, to be applied more widely, further efforts are required.The findings in this thesis could be used to develop better water management policies for peat extraction areas, or other industries operating in similar soils and climate. For example, meltwater could be allowed to temporarily bypass treatment facilities in areas with deep soil frost penetration. The wetland study showed that peatland-based wetlands are a suitable approach for improving water treatment performance even under variable hydraulic loads. The uncertainty in the estimated load from a small peat extraction catchment was high, which might limit the use of such data for some purposes. Load estimation methods using the concentration data collected during previous years might be able to reduce the uncertainty, but if the uncertainty needs to be lowered substantially use of sensor technology might be the only viable approach.

Rosetta branch is one of the two main branches in Nile delta and El-Rahawy drain is one of this main sources, which outlet on the branch. It is subjected to many sources of pollutions from municipalities, agriculture and industry, but only little information is available on the quality of river water. The aim of this study was to analyze the river water quality in Rosetta branch at the outlet of El-Rahawy drain, Nile delta. Water samples were collected seasonally from El-Rahawy and Rosetta branch and the following physicochemical parameters were analyzed: hydrogen ion concentration (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia (NH3), total alkalinity (CO3+HCO3); biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The results were compared with the water quality standards of Egypt (Law 48/1982), FAO and Canadian Water Quality standards (CWQGs). Statistical studies were carried out by calculating correlation coefficients between different parameters. The large transports of NH3, and TDS with low COD, BOD and DO values along El-Rahawy drain were seriously deteriorating the water quality in the downstream of Rosetta branch, especially during the low flow condition in winter.
