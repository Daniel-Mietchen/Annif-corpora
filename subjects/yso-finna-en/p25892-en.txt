Being Agile is your roadmap to successfully transforming your organization to an Agile culture. Veteran agile coach Mario Moreira teaches new adopters how to implement a robust Agile framework to derive from it the maximum business benefit in terms of customer value, revenue, and employee engagement. Agile is a ubiquitous watchword in the corporate world, but only a minority of companies understand and practice what they pay lip service to. Too many content themselves with half-baked approximations such as Fragile (fragile Agile), ScrumBut (Scrum but not the practices), and Scrum Fall (mini-waterfalls in the sprints). Moreira shows maturing early adopters how to bridge the chasm between going through the motions of doing Agile and genuinely being Agile. After a high-level synopsis of Agile's values and principles, methodologies (including Scrum, Kanban, DSDM, Leam, VFQ, and XP), and roles, Moreira plunges into the nitty-gritty of how to apply the ready, implement, coach, and hone (RICH) deployment model to all phases of a project in such a way as to embody and inculcate agile values and principles at the team level and promote agile transformation across your organization's culture
Agile CRM system implementation project
The enterprise and Scrum
It is fair to say that Agile development is today's major trend. It is used more or less in every company if the company is involved in mobile software industry. Agile development is also widely used in other embedded software development. It is recognized to be a very effective and efficient way of development. However, there are many issues which are needed to be considered and taken into account when transferring to this process model. Especially the transferring period can be very difficult and have a long lasting effect to a company. The aim of this Master's thesis was to study more deeply this subject and find a different way to conquer the challenges what comes to this subject. There are so many positive experiences from this, but normally some of the negative sides have been left out. I have experienced a transfer in my own career and I saw really close what kind of things are usually left out and not told. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate how well Agile methods suit in embedded software development. Agile works well what comes just to software projects, but when talking about embedded development, the process is not always so easy. Embedded devices vary for example from small music players to big and complex medical devices. This thesis will concentrate only on small portable devices, since my experience comes from that field. I used mainly my own experiences and situations I have met to find a suitable process. In theory parts I used different publications from the Internet and books to back up my knowledge. I managed to present basic practices and processes from different methodologies that I discovered as good in embedded development. Next steps would be to test these different processes in practice. Since there are many different kinds of embedded systems out there, every modified process has to be first tested in a real life before it can be decided whether can it be taken in to use or not.
This book contains the refereed proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Agile Software Development, XP 2014, held in Rome, Italy, in May 2014. Because of the wide application of agile approaches in industry, the need for collaboration between academics and practitioners has increased in order to develop the body of knowledge available to support managers, system engineers, and software engineers in their managerial/economic and architectural/project/technical decisions. Year after year, the XP conference has facilitated such improvements and provided evidence on the advantages of agile methodologies by examining the latest theories, practical applications, and implications of agile and lean methods. The 15 full papers, seven short papers, and four experience reports accepted for XP 2014 were selected from 59 submissions and are organized in sections on: agile development, agile challenges and contracting, lessons learned and agile maturity, how to evolve software engineering teaching, methods and metrics, and lean development.
Competition in the Internet markets are tremendous, due to the fact that software development is cheaper than ever before due to Cloud environments, DevOps and vast scale of productive frameworks.    Companies are constantly seeking ways to enhance their design and development processes and practices to remain competitive in the market. Alma Mediapartners is no different, thesis will follow the project where today's buzzwords are taken in action to experiment new approaches to enhance company's existing software development processes.    In the ordinary project, the team participating will begin with business analysis; continue designing the solution and that then developing the solution. Web application development in Alma Mediapartners roughly consists of two phases from lifespan vice: software development project and after successful release, the small scale development. For each phase practices from Lean startup and Lean UX are tested to find what benefits these practices might bring to the business analysis and application design.    Thesis will follow how team members experienced with Agile approaches such as Scrum are able to adapt to new ideas relating to the practices and technologies used. Project team will construct from hybrid organization having members from Alma Mediapartners and foreign subcontractor. Past experience of the development team has been from building complete systems, which are well planned replacement investments. Now that the team must form the solution from entirely new setting, how will the team previously fully focused on completeness adapt to building solution iteratively based upon feedback received.    From technology point of view, the project will evaluate different technological choices which would support the Lean UX and startup principles the best. Not to forget environmental aspects how CD and DevOps will effect to the development work. Key words: lean ux, lean startup, continuous delivery, mean, mvp.

Customer discovery and customer validation in lean software startups
In the contract development process, as in any development process, clients, customers, and managers have a vested interest in meeting time, budget, and performance requirements. In Agile Contracts , the authors tackle these concerns head on, presenting an agile contract that they have developed, which reduces the risk for the both supplier and the customer. This highly useful book compares and contrasts the new, agile contract with existing fixed-price or time-and-material contracts and clearly demonstrates how Agile/Scrum can be applied....

Software development has been progressively transforming into distributed development during the last decade. Software outsourcing has been using increasingly more suppliers in low cost countries, such as India and China. Projects implemented in these countries have been criticized for higher business cost eventually due to lower productivity and quality than projects in western countries. The question when to make or buy has led to the need for measuring suppliers. However, measuring subcontractors is not a straightforward issue. Both productivity and quality do not have simple reliable indicators and they both affect each other. The main objective in this thesis was to find a set of metrics that could measure the subcontractor and help them to focus on continuous improvement. Other objectives were to find communication, agile ways of working and tools for improving productivity. The final objective was to study how to increase innovation activities. The metrics were first piloted in two projects and then they were taken into wider use in the company. Case study was chosen as the study strategy. Members of four dfferent projects were interviewed using earlier studies and personal experience as the theroretical framework. The interview material was analysed using content analysis. The main result of the study was a set of metrics consisting of three parts: content, quality and Net Promoter Score. The supplier could not be compared with these metrics but these metrics enhanced communication and continuous improvement in projects. Daily scrums were seen as the best agile principle and the findings about tools for productivity were slim: non-working tools have an extensive negative effect. The last finding involves innovations: as long as outsourcing is expected to be cost-effective with tight schedules, innovative ideas are not to be expected.
Kanban in action
Agile teams have been struggling with the concept of continuous improvement since the first Agile frameworks were developed, and still very little has been written about the practice of continuous improvement in Agile environments. Although team retrospectives have been prescribed and some practices have been introduced in order to implement and facilitate them, the truth is that most Agile teams are conducting dull retrospectives that end with a list of things that have been done wrong, just to repeat the same list two weeks later at the next meeting. Instead of listing hundreds of Japanese-labeled tools, this book gives you practical insights into how to spot improvement opportunities, how to plan for improvement and how to engage everyone in your company in the Kaizen process. In addition, it will also provide you with 27 proven practices and 12 bonus activities to introduce into your retrospectives in order to keep them fresh, creative and exciting, so you can promise a team that, in a year's time, no two retrospectives will be alike. This book helps you as a manager, team leader, change agent or consultant in any type of organization to unleash the real power of Kaizen cultures - no matter what kind of organization, market, product, technology, vision, goal or size. It provides you with the background, tools and practical hints on how to engage your organization in a process of continuous quest for new and better ways of performing.
Customer stimulation in lean software develpment
Technical excellence in agile software projects
according to agile values and principles and not vice versa. There are different maturity models to measure the agile maturity in the organization. These maturity models are meant to help the organization to better adapt the agile methods and thus become more effective in software development. In this work, the author has followed adaptation of agile methods in the target organization. Purpose of this work is to measure the agile maturity in the target organization, to find out are agile values and principles followed and is there Lean waste detected in the organization. Author measured in this work that agile maturity for the target organization is somewhere in the middle point. There are five maturity levels in the model used and organization is somewhere between two and three. The management in target organization is not well aware of agile values and principles. Most of the management believes that it is enough if they only have basic information from the agile software development methods. Also some teams have sometimes customized the Scrum method to better fit the environment they are acting in. The understanding and awareness of the agile values and principles should be clarified in the whole organization.
Challenges in managing large-scale agile software development transformation
Agile data warehouse design : collaborative dimensional modeling, from whiteboard to star schema
Modern software development must adapt to demanding schedules while keeping the software at a high level of quality. Agile software development has been adopted in recent years to meet such a need. Test-driven development (TDD) is one practice that has arisen within the agile software development movement that leverages unit tests to develop software in incremental cycles. TDD supporters claim that the practice increases the productivity of the practitioners who employ it, as well as the internal and external quality of the software they develop. In order to validate or refute such claims, the software engineering research community has studied TDD for the last decade; the results of the empirical studies on the effects of TDD have been mostly inconclusive. This dissertation has studied two factors that may impact the manifestation of the claimed effects of TDD on software's external quality and developers' productivity: the developers' conformance to the process (i.e., their ability to follow TDD) and their skills. The research was performed in four phases. In the first phase, the literature was reviewed to identify a set of factors that have been considered to affect TDD. In the second phase, two experiments were executed within academia. A total of 77 students at the University of Oulu, took part in the studies. These experiments investigated the quality of the software, as well as the subject's productivity with respect to their programming and testing skills. A follow-up study, using data collected during the second experiment, explored the relation between the quality, productivity and the subjects' process conformance. In the third phase, four industrial experiments, involving 30 professional, were performed. Process conformance and skills were investigated in relation to the TDD's effects on external quality and productivity. The fourth phase synthesized the evidence gathered in the two previous phases. The results show that TDD is not associated with improvements in external quality, or developers' productivity. Further, improvements in both external quality and productivity are associated with skills, rather than with the process, at least in the case of professional developers. Hence, process conformance has a negligible impact. The productivity of novice developers, on the other hand, can benefit from the test-first approach promoted by TDD.
