REST continues to gain momentum as the best method for building web services, leaving many web architects to consider whether and how to include this approach in their SOA and SOAP-dominated world. This book offers a down-to-earth explanation of REST, with techniques and examples that show you how to design and implement integration solutions using the REST architectural style. * Explore several web communications approaches, and discover what makes REST different * Walk through the pros and cons of the RESTful approach * Learn how the underlying architecture of the Web can drastically simplify programming built on top of it * View REST in the context of cloud computing and the Semantic Web * Understand how hypermedia serves as a model for computers to process data.

This paper is an overview on the Open Government Data (OGD) environment in the EU. It aims to point out the relevant legal issues together with the economic aspects arising from the disclosure and exploitation of OGD. Therefore, the paper highlights the noteworthy technological aspects related with the opening of OGD datasets. This survey is based on an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinarity in the digital environment means that OGD should be considered as an integrated, interoperable and collaborative ecosystem. The main legislative source taken into account for the survey is the Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information as recently amended by the Directive 37/2013/EU..

In this book common sense computing techniques are further developed and applied to bridge the semantic gap between word-level natural language data and the concept-level opinions conveyed by these. In particular, the ensemble application of graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction techniques is exploited on two common sense knowledge bases to develop a novel intelligent engine for open-domain opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The proposed approach, termed sentic computing, performs a clause-level semantic analysis of text, which allows the inference of both the conceptual and emot.
rules. In order to evaluate the overhead that the proposed access control scheme introduces to the system, the response time for four different types of requests to perform actions (supported by SSAP protocol) is measured. The requests include the request for reading, inserting, updating, and deleting a triple, for different sizes of the SIB (ranging from 1 to 100000 triples). We used the Python language in the experiment, which is one of the supported languages by KP Interface (KPI). Through the obtained results, we concluded that the proposed idea is considered as an efficient way of controlling the access in the Smart-M3 framework at triple level.

Self-management in distributed systems : smart adaptive framework for pervasive computing environments
Entity Information Life Cycle for Big Data walks you through the ins and outs of managing entity information so you can successfully achieve master data management (MDM) in the era of big data. This book explains big data's impact on MDM and the critical role of entity information management system (EIMS) in successful MDM. Expert authors Dr. John R. Talburt and Dr. Yinle Zhou provide a thorough background in the principles of managing the entity information life cycle and provide practical tips and techniques for implementing an EIMS, strategies for exploiting distributed processing to handle big data for EIMS, and examples from real applications. Additional material on the theory of EIIM and methods for assessing and evaluating EIMS performance also make this book appropriate for use as a textbook in courses on entity and identity management, data management, customer relationship management (CRM), and related topics.
