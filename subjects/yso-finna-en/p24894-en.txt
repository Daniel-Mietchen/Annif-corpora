Counseling : A comprehensive profession ; Samuel T. Gladding
This work aims to bring together theory and practice from psychoanalysis, literary and cultural studies and the growing field of creative writing studies. The book also seeks to highlight the importance of autobriography as an opening into fiction writing but as a powerful therapeutic tool. The author discusses how autobiographical fiction can be used in therapeutic work by art therapists, psychotherapists and creative writing tutors, as well as in personal development by writers of any kind. She draws up guidelines for a successful course on autobiography and creative writing and presents case studies and practical ideas for writing about the self. In addition, the book explores how writing autobiographical fiction can help people to explore significant events and relationships in their lives.
