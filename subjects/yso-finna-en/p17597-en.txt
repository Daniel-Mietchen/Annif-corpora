Authors Gerald W. Driskill and Angela Laird Brenton have created a stimulating workbook to guide students through data collection, analysis, interpretation, and application of organizational culture data using a practical five-step process. Based on more than 20 years of experience in using this approach with hundreds of students, the authors help students apply cultural insights to fostering diversity, supporting organizational change, making leadership more dynamic, exploring the link between ethics and culture, and making organizations more effective overall. Organizational Culture in Action is an excellent supplemental text for advanced undergraduate or graduate students studying organizational communication, organizational culture, organizational development, leadership development, or managerial communication.

Followership in action : cases and commentaries
Throughout the history of business employees had to adapt to managers and managers had to adapt to organizations. In the future this is reversed with managers and organizations adapting to employees. This means that in order to succeed and thrive organizations must rethink and challenge everything they know about work. The demographics of employees are changing and so are employee expectations, values, attitudes, and styles of working. Conventional management models must be replaced with leadership approaches adapted to the future employee. Organizations must also rethink their traditional structure, how they empower employees, and what they need to do to remain competitive in a rapidly changing world. This is a book about how employees of the future will work, how managers will lead, and what organizations of the future will look like. -- Publisher website.

Organizing relationships : traditional and emerging perspectives on workplace relationships
Organizational culture and climate continues to engage academic interest and debate. Culture has increasingly been linked to a diverse range of individuals and organizational behaviours. However, despite the international interest and importance of the concept, the dominant literature in this field has tended to reflect an Angloâ€“US model and perspective. There are no significant texts which have attempted to combine and integrate the more traditional with the more emergent perspective. This book will be the first volume to offer authoritative, critical and comprehensive discussion and information on the topic. It will review the current state of the art in terms of the theoretical and methodological issues and problems and it will consider future research directions.

Organizational behavior : foundations, theories, and analyses
Originally part of Berrett-Koehler Communication's "Collaborating for Change" series, this short introduction to Appreciative Inquiry is the best way for organisations to be introduced to AI by the originators and leaders of the movement itself. Now with a new introduction and updated with revisions throughout, "Appreciative Inquiry" offers an approach that works because it acknowledges the prevailing attitudes toward change. It offers a fresh view based on the possibility of a more desirable future, experience with the whole system and activities that signal "something different is happening this time." That difference systematically taps the potential of human beings to make themselves, their organisations and their communities more adaptive and more effective. This approach is based on solid, proven principles for unleashing people's creativity, knowledge and spirit toward a common purpose.
"Businesses are built by growing relationships with customers. Culture is created by the stories those relationships tell. Two of the most important differentiators of a business are its talent and its culture. Talent energized by a compelling culture will drive organizational success and provide innovative growth opportunities for both the business and the individual. Based on her more than thirty years at Chick-fil-A, most of which have been spent as Vice President, Corporate Talent, Dee Ann Turner shares how Chick-fil-A has built a devoted talent and fan base that spans generations. It's My Pleasure tells powerful stories and provides practical applications on how to develop extraordinary talent able to build and/or stimulate a company's culture"--Jacket.

"As the pace of change in organizations increases, leaders and HR personnel must support their employees, show understanding as to why employees might react in a certain way, what they need from their working relationships, and how staff might be better motivated. Neuroscience can offer insights into all these issues. Neuroscience for Organizational Change shows how to take the findings from neuroscience and put them into action by looking at the importance of communicating change effectively through storytelling, explaining how better understanding of the brain enables better planning of organizational change, managing emotions, and creating a feeling of social connection that employees can draw on for support during times of change. Each chapter includes illustrations, solutions and examples of what other companies have done, and questions/checklist at the end"--

Managerial process and organizational behavior
"Understanding how employees' brains work enables organizations to build cultures, design structures and processes that help people to be more innovative, productive and engaged. This has lasting impact in terms of meeting business objectives and becoming an employer of choice. We need to change the way we manage change in organizations: by understanding the brain we can do this better. Neuroscience brings a new lens through which to look at people and to understand why they react to situations in a certain way, what they need from work relationships to perform at their best, and how they might be better motivated. Neuroscience for Organizational Change not only provides evidence that will persuade the most sceptical of leaders but also provides many practical examples of how to apply the insights. The book provides a 'win-win': it will enable the organization to improve performance and also help to support the mental and emotional well-being of employees. Amongst other areas, Neuroscience for Organizational Change explores why we find organizational change difficult and what we can do to keep people focused and performing at their best. It looks at our need for social connection at work, the essential role that leaders and managers play, how best to manage emotions and reduce bias to avoid making flawed decisions, and why we need communication, involvement and storytelling to help us through change. It also sets out a new science-based planning tool, SPACES, to enhance motivation"--

Essentials of organizational behavior
This thesis was developed in order to help the commissionaire, the Microscopy and Nanotechnology Centre at Oulu University (MNT), acquire a better understanding of the current state of the market for material analyses services in Northern Bothnia region. The main purpose of this research paper is, by using applied marketing research tools- a quantitative survey, to collect as much information possible about the customers who are purchasing material analyses in the region. The main research areas have been value creation and customersâ€™ satisfaction, regular customer behaviour and information channels used in the purchasing process. The background analyses included a theory review of B2B marketing and the organizational behaviour in specific. Moreover a SME framework has been drawn, also the buying behaviour in organizations and the value creation has been discussed to provide to the reader a theoretical fundament for the research to come. The conveyed survey managed to successfully attract respondents in order to provide valid answers to the preliminary objectives. The main conclusions have been made in reference with the building ideal material analyses service and in considerations with the future trends on the market. A material service provider that is fast, reliable, cooperative, versatile and experienced has been stated to be the most desired research partner. Furthermore, as outsourcing seems to be the future trend in the area, the importance of heterogenic service provider has been described. There is still a demand for further analyses in the area of start-up material analyses research and the exploration of the decision making in regards with buying behaviour.
This text provides a comprehensive treatment using multiple theoretical perspectives to understand and examine all workplace relationships. It helps readers broaden and enrich the ways they think about workplace relationships and their role in organizational processes.

"Organization development is the systematic method of taking an objective look at how an organization is operating and gathering information, and then deciding on the most appropriate action to help that organization develop and improve. Written by two leading experts in the field, this updated second edition of Organization Development includes new coverage of complexity and chaos theory, new case studies describing OD practices and attitudes in countries outside of the U.S. and U.K., and new chapters on change and culture and employee engagement and wellbeing. The authors have also re-structured the book's format, creating greater cross-referencing between the HR and OD sections and an added emphasis on the collaborations between OD and HR functions. "--

"In Red Team, security expert Micah Zenko provides an in-depth investigation into the work of red teams, revealing the best practices, most common pitfalls, and most effective strategies of these modern-day Devil's Advocates. He shows how competitive organizations, from private corporations to whole governments, can and should mitigate risk by red teaming. A growing number of institutions are already using this approach, Zenko shows, but he argues that the potential of red teaming far exceeds its current applications. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and his own training at the U.S. Army's Red Team University (which he was the first civilian to attend), Zenko traces the history of red teaming, describes its current uses, and explores its vast potential in today's interconnected, multipolar world. The basic techniques of red teaming remain the same whether applied to the CIA, IBM, or the NFL, and executed correctly they can yield impressive results: red teams have given businesses an edge over their competition, confirmed vital CIA intelligence, and troubleshot dangerous military missions long before there were boots on the ground. But red teams are only as good as the leaders who commission them, and Zenko shows not only how to create an empowered red team, but also what to do with its advice. Essential reading for policy wonks and business leaders alike, Red Team will revolutionize the way organizations think about, exploit, compensate for, and correct their institutional strengths and weaknesses. Through illuminating case studies and never-before-told stories, Zenko shows how any group--from army units to credit card companies to sports teams--can win by thinking like the enemy"--

"Positive Organizational Scholarship" is a book that helps establish a new field of study in the organizational sciences. It examines a variety of positive dynamics in organizations that give rise to extraordinary outcomes, often described by words, such as excellence, thriving, flourishing, abundance, vitality, and resilience. POS has a bias toward life-giving, generative, and ennobling human phenomena. It represents a value perspective based on ideas of "goodness" and positive human potential. POS is distinguished from traditional organizational studies in that it seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition, and it does so in rigorous ways, based on scholarly research and theory. Chapters in this volume will serve as the key reference material for those interested in understanding exceptional, virtuous, life-giving, and flourishing individual and organizational behavior.

"Google amazes us by generating answers before we even finish asking a question. Netflix delights us with spot-on recommendations. These companies use the power of Big Data-the collection and analysis of massive amounts of information. It's one of the hottest concepts in business. But while many companies are embracing Big Data to understand their customers, very few are applying it to their own employees. One of the pioneers in that effort has been acclaimed digital marketing agency Klick Health. Now Klick's leaders share the principles that guided their fast growth and low turnover. Klick CEO Leerom Segal and his colleagues show how personalizing each employee's experience can increase their engagement, help them learn new skills faster, and be placed with the right teams. The authors outline the three transformative ideas they've developed for "decoding" any company or department-figuring out what really makes it tick, so you can maximize its potential. The authors share success stories from Klick and other organizations, and offer a bold new approach to designing and managing a workplace. The result is a groundbreaking book for any company that wants the best from its people"--

"Agility" is the ability to continuously adapt to rapidly changing circumstances, while "resilience" is being able to bounce back from setbacks. Resilience is essential if a company's benefits are to endure in the long run and if their employees' loyalty is to be kept.The Agile Organization focuses on how to build both agility and resilience at individual, team, and organizational levels. Author Linda Holbeche puts the process of developing agile strategy, structures, and processes into the big picture context.This book provides OD/HR practitioners with ways to be effective in a 24/7 business culture, to recognize and avoid the pitfalls of achieving agility without also building organizational resilience, and to understand the importance of involving people in transforming organizations for greater agility.Combining case studies, self-assessment tools, guidelines, and practical checklists with theory, Holbeche explains how to achieve organizational agility while also maintaining and enhancing employee engagement and resilience.
