The purpose of this thesis work was to research the bottlenecks in solar energy, to calculate energy payback time and to increase solar energy in Finland. This thesis was made as part of the Solarleap project, where Turku University of Applied Sciences and Satakunta University of Applied Sciences are partners together. This thesis is the first step on this project, and there will be more researches when the project goes forward. The theory part consists of solar energy and its effectiveness in Finland. The most common photovoltaic and thermal photovoltaic technologies are also presented. In the theory part, renewable energy sources and possibilities in Finland and also photovoltaics supply chain is discussed. The research part includes a discussion on the bottlenecks in solar energy, the investment costs of photovoltaic systems and the payback time of energy. Solar energy has lots of potential in Finland, but solar energy?s market share is small and the knowhow could be better. Also the energy payback time is bigger than in Europe.

The main goal of this engineering thesis was to examine Tupla chocolate bar's route from manufacturer to consumer. The length of this transportation is interesting since the Tupla bar is food and therefore, will eventually expire. In February of 2003 there was carried out a withdrawal because of a misstaste found in Tupla. The Best Before  dates on the returned products reveal how old products there are for sale. A survey was also arranged to find out how the withdrawal was experienced both at Leaf Oy and at the cooperating companies this project concerned. The results of the survey were analyzed.

Abstract: This study discusses the supply chain of a small e-commerce company. The focus is on Supplier Relationship Management and procurement. The objective of this study was to give recommendations and suggestions for the case company to answer the current challenges and to improve the order fulfillment operations in order to avoid and eliminate risks. The research was conducted as a case study. The case study started with conducting a current state analysis of the case company's order fulfillment operations, including a process flow description. Challenges and risks were recognized based on this analysis. Data collection was based on interviews with case company employees working on the related operations. The researcher's own observations were also utilized as one method. Following the current state analysis a theoretical review on related topics was conducted. The topics discussed were Supply Chain Management, Procurement, E-procurement, Supplier relationship management, supplier acquisition and assessment and processes. This review was based on literature and earlier studies written on these topics.    Based on the findings from the theoretical practices and the current state of the order fulfillment recommendations were provided for the case company. The recommendations cover supplier measuring and assessment, demand consideration, supplier integration and establishing processes. These proposals were identified as the main areas of concentration in possible future improvement to be performed by the case company.

Based on more than 10 years of practical experience in the field of supply chain management, Oliver MuÌˆnch indicates that in favor of sustainability within the supply chain the paradox purchasing savings can and should be substituted with the approach of the First-Time-Right Procurement. This dissertation subjects the monetary measurement of purchasing savings to a critical examination and questions whether it still applies. It indicates that monetary purchasing savings exert a negative impact on sustainable company success. In order to achieve a long-term sustainable success, it is proposed that the monetary measurement of purchasing savings can be replaced by measuring process times within the procurement organization.

Delivery reliability : a study about delivery reliability in large machine or structure delivery projects
The aim for this study was to increase delivery reliability in large machine or structure delivery projects. The subject is still almost completely unstudied. Pragmatically the aim was to collect problems that cause loss of time and resources and therefore decrease of quality, to see if there are good practices or solutions to these projects and to test them in actual projects to see if they actually work and to get some data or evaluations about the saved resources. It took a much longer time than planned to complete this study, but this was rather a good thing for the project. This way it gave time to gather more experience-based knowledge, to see various practices in various projects, and most of all, gave time to try out the small improvements that make the difference. The method of having experience-based knowledge and other studies side by side brought depth and a good comparison to this study even though the other studies were not exactly about this topic. It was rather astonishing to notice that though there are hundreds and thousands studies about JIT (just in time) factory improvements and supply chain management for manufacturing industry, very little interest was given to delivery projects. The interviews revealed that every entity in this branch of business worries about some of these issues every now and then, but nobody had never given it a systematical approach. Quite remarkable is that the problems and solutions are the same in several different kinds of delivery projects. It is also interesting is that these problems are not usually one-of-a-kind and good practices are at least known, but still unused. Even small changes can make significant savings to project.The solutions introduced in this study have been proven efficient and that by implementing even some of them in use, a fair amount of resources can be saved. Therefore the study can be considered to be a success. Most of the actions are implemented to practice and thus the results can be considered reliable. Yet, there are still a great deal of possibilities to continue to study this matter and to go deeper in details as this study is at the general level.

Designing an international supply chain
Abstract: The aim of supply chain management is the delivery and service chain optimization, cost reduction, increase in sales and enhanced customer service. In the Nordic countries, where the distances are long, it is normally necessary to maintain inventories. Another reason for inventories is often uncertainty. Inventories must be maintained as customers want fast shipping, but do not tell in advance when and how much they are going to buy different products. The supply chain management is a very practical activity. It is not solved by using statistical models, or by the IT systems. The most important part of the chain, are the people. The employees should, however, use mathematics and systems to help improve the efficiency of the supply chain.    The purpose of this work was to review old and define new purchasing parameters for Pernod Ricard Finland Oy and create a continuous process to define the parameters for the company by using mathematical and statistical methods. The goal of this research was to get better understanding of planning fluctuations and improve and define the planning parameters with fact based knowledge.    An action research study was carried out during autumn 2012 and spring 2013. This work initially examined the various theories to improve purchasing parameters, in particular the management of the safety stocks, and determined what kind of planning method should be used for planning various types of products in order to generate the best possible forecast with right information to suppliers and other parties.    Based on the theory new parameters for the purchase of Pernod Ricard Finland Oy were defined for certain products, implemented into system and the results were analyzed after few months. As the results of the research trial were promising the final result of the project was a new process and guidelines on how the purchasing parameters will be defined in the company.

The automotive industry and its supply chain has historically been a pioneer. However, in its second century the car industry is lagging behind in supply chain management and is not able to streamline the production volume to meet demand. The automotive industry is estimated to have 20% of overcapacity worldwide. The automotive supply chain and the production methods have not changed much since Henry Ford's Model T over a century ago. Customer oriented Build to Order approach has been identified to be the opposite to current Build to Stock, but adapting new approach in complex and conventional supply chain is easier said than done. Hence the study compares the two major logistic and production approaches used in automotive industry, build to order and build to stock. The study has been conducted as a desktop study, benefitting from the author's personal experience and interest in the field. The aim of the thesis is to find the reasoning behind the hardly proceeding shift from build to stock to build to order. The study also suggests improvements to automotive supply chain even if it was to stay as build to stock. It is suggested in the thesis that an even bigger obstacle than investments in new machinery, technology in the factory and lack of knowledge, is the mindset in the industry. Things have been done the way they have been for a century, and it is difficult to convince the industry that not only a change, but many changes are needed to achieve flexibility in all the aspects.

This final thesis was done as a part of Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK) International Business degree, the final thesis of International Business degree is worth 15 cr. The final thesis was done to Valmet Automotive Inc., which is a Finnish contract vehicle manufacturing company.  The purpose of the final thesis was to study a part of Valmet Automotive's Partner Web, which is a web-based information and evaluation hub for VA and VA's associates such as suppliers. This final thesis was done as a part of Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK) International Business degree, the final thesis of International Business degree is worth 15 cr. The thesis relates to logistics, as a part of the TAMK IB degree and the Green Supply Chain Management module. The final thesis was done to Valmet Automotive Inc., which is a Finnish contract vehicle manufacturing company that also offers various vehicle engineering services, including manufacturing, concept cars and convertible roof engineering and design.  The thesis study was conducted at the Valmet Automotive premises in Uusikaupunki, using the tools provided by Valmet Automotive. The purpose of the final thesis was to study a part of Valmet Automotive's Partner Web, which is a web-based information and evaluation hub for VA and VA's associates such as suppliers. The area of study was a Parts Per Million application (also referred as PPM), which is an application that tracks numerous different supplier deviations, for example delayed deliveries and quality deviations. The application is also capable of displaying the deviations in different type of charts. The idea of the application is to enhance supplier cooperation, as well as evaluate performance and engage in continuous improvement. After introducing background theory for supply chain management and supplier man-agement, the goal was to examine the definitions of the PPM application, namely how the application handles the deviation calculations. Valmet Automotive's interest in the final thesis subject was to examine the effects of long transportation times on the PPM figure accuracy. In order to create comparable data, four  comparable suppliers were chosen. The only differentiating factor from the study's point of view was transportation times. The main goal of the research was to find improvement ideas as well as potential problems on the application. Thesis related background information, research, analysis and conclusion have been removed from this final thesis version on the basis of confidentiality agreement.

Experience has shown that a basic prerequisite for successful mechanization of the agricultural sector requires a well-functioning supply chain. To draw lessons for achieving this goal, the FAO Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division commissioned three mechanization supply chain case studies. The studies were conducted in Kenya, Pakistan and Brazil and the information contained in them has been used as the basis for the analysis presented in this technical report. Historically, public sector efforts to supply mechanization services have often failed as costs greatly exceeded income and the maintenance of aging machinery fleets became too great a burden. However it is evident that the public sector does have a role to play in complementing the activities of the private sector in a synergistic partnership. The main role of the public sector is to have the vision of a national mechanization strategy and to cultivate an enabling environment which allows the private sector to operate effectively. One key possibility described in the report is that of linking equipment supply chains across continents. This is exemplified by an account of the evolution of no-till technology in Brazil which is now being successfully used by farmers in Asia and Africa. A key stakeholder in this supply chain development has been FAO in conjunction with the international donor community, as they have been in a position to take a holistic view to encourage private sector actors and so disseminate profitable mechanization technologies from one continent to another. The main recommendations of the technical report are aimed at policy makers in the public sector, although there is plenty of interest to other stakeholders, especially machinery suppliers and mechanization service providers. However the ultimate beneficiaries are small and medium scale farmers who are the recipients of the services provided.--Publisher's description.

This thesis was done for Valmet Automotive, and especially for their projects. The purpose was to create supplier coaching material for Valmet Automotives logistics, as well any other potential materials needed for coaching. These materials can ensure that logistic coaching is done containing all prerequisite logistical areas. In addition, these materials enable functional and effective cooperation along with unproblematic supplier chain functions. The implementation of the coaching is also discussed in this thesis. The theoretical section consists of research into the new and global logistical environment. Changes resulting from moving operations mainly within Europe to global environment also introduce many new aspects to the supply chain, including communication, business cultures and wider supply chain management. In the empirical section the actual supplier coaching material for logistics is created, including all the different logistical areas in which suppliers need to receive instruction. Coaching materials also exist for current customers / suppliers, but this material can only be used as a checklist. In this new material the changes which the global logistical environment has brought to different logistical areas are examined.
