How to cheat in After Effects
The result of this thesis produces visual materials in this aspect to guide students and staff members on how to act eco-friendly. On the technical side, it contributes theoretical concepts and practical examples on shooting a short movie from pre-production to post-production. To complete this paper, knowledge on environment conservation and video making techniques are developed. The information is gathered from the section of sustainable development from OUAS’ website and intranet. On video-making techniques, books and practical experiences through implementation are the main resources. The process of making short movies is carried out from March until the end of May 2014, with the use of movie editing software such as Adobe Premier Pro and Adobe After Effects. Cameras and necessary equipment are supported by OUAS laboratory. Edited parts have been temporarily stored in OUAS’ hard drive until the full movies are completed. After the movies are done, a link will be added to OUAS intranet, section of sustainable development, so that everybody can access them easily. Also, they are available from the author’s Youtube channel. The final videos are not only used in Green Thinking course, but in other classes as well, for example in Video lectures.

"This critically acclaimed training course from Adobe Press and video2brain combines interactive video and a printed reference to teach the fundamentals of Premiere Pro CS6 as well as the basic principles of video editing. Structured around the objectives of the Adobe Certified Associate exam 'Video Communication Using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6', the product combines 15 hours of video, complete with lesson files. Experienced instructor Maxim Jago introduces core non-linear editing techniques as a first step to using advanced edits, with special effects, complex timelines, titles, clean audio and music. By the end of this course, the student will be able to work with multiple media types, create sequences and output to multiple formats using Premiere Pro CS6. Maxim walks the student through the complete editing process using Premiere Pro CS6, including importing media, using clips and markers, adding transitions, correcting color, and compositing. New features get special treatment, like stabilizing footage without visiting After Effects, applying effects via adjustment layers, and streamlined trimming using JKL dynamic trimming, which allows you to play your edits and adjust the timing of your cuts in a single step."--Resource description page.
