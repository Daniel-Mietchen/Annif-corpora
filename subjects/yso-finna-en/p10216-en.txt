In an artistic career spanning five decades, and for which he was best known as poet, artist, dramatist, designer and film-maker, Jean Cocteau was also involved, directly and indirectly, with nearly twenty ballets. While he was not in the strictest sense a choreographer, his infl uence on such works as Parade, Le Jeune homme et la mort, Orphee, and La Dame a la licorne was all pervasive – from the "poesie" of the dramatic action, to lighting, to costume and set design. His creations, in collaboration with composers and choreographers, were fully integrated theatre pieces. Frank Ries has researched all of Cocteau's ballets and, using interviews, Cocteau's own writings, reviews and critiques – some of which have never before been translated – presents this survey and analysis of Cocteau's involvement in the world of dance.
