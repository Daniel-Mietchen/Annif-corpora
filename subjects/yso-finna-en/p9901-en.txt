Master seafarers : the Phoenicians and the Greeks
In 1204, the Byzantine Empire was conquered by troops from western Europe ostensibly taking part in the Fourth Crusade. This was a hugely significant event for the subjects of the Empire, radically altering the Byzantines' self-image and weakening their state for the later conflict with the Ottoman Turks. Using the theory of ethnicity - a comparatively recent tool with regard to the pre-modern era - Gill Page provides fresh insight into the late Byzantine period, providing a corrective to nationalistic interpretations of the period of Frankish rule and more broadly to generally held assumptions of ethnic hostility in the period. A systematic analysis of texts in Greek from the period 1200-1420, from both ends of the social spectrum, is backed up by an in-depth study of Frankish rule in the Peloponnese to reveal the trends in the development of Byzantine identity under the impact of the Franks.

The ancient Greeks set out from their homeland to colonize and settle almost all the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. They were a remarkable people, who have left their imprint on virtually every aspect of modern human endeavour - politics, theatre, art, philosophy, medicine, architecture and athletics. This exceptional book reveals how they developed and adapted from Paleolithic times on, and how they interacted, both peaceably and otherwise, with the surrounding cultures: Minoans, Carians, Phoenicians, Lydians, Persians and Romans. Extracts from Classical authors and inscriptions provide eye-witness accounts of events, people and places, bringing the story vividly to life and allowing the Greeks to speak for themselves.

Full of sharp portraits and humorous, telling descriptions of the many statesmen and financiers Peterson has known over the years, "The Education of an American Dreamer" is a richly satisfying journey through a fascinating man's life--beginning in Kearney, Nebraska, as an eight-year-old manning the cash register, to Secretary of Commerce in Nixon's paranoid White House, to the tumultuous days of Lehman Brothers, and on to the creation of The Blackstone Group, one of the great financial enterprises in recent times

In 1872, Jacob Burckhardt, one of the preeminent historians of classical and Renaissance culture, presented this revolutionary work, which portrays ancient Greek culture as an aristocratic world based on a ruthless competition for honor, a competition that led, in turn, to a tyranous state with minimal personal freedoms. Burckhardt's landmark project, the culmination of thirty years of scholarlship by leading Oxford historian, Oswyn Murray, offers a rich cultural history of a fascinating society.

Greek colonisation : an account of Greek colonies and other settlements overseas
This volume traces the social, economic and political history of the Greeks between 500 and 1050. The book adopts an interdisciplinary approach and uses archaeological evidence, as well as coins and seals, fiscal documents, medieval chronicles, and hagiographic literature to examine the development of Greek culture in the early medieval period. Several themes provide the foundation for this volume and run through the chapters; these include the Balkan context, the Social Role of the Army and the Onset of Economic Growth. Special attention is paid to the size of the economy in early medieval Greece. Both the social and the economic are privileged and analyzed together as integrally connected spheres of life, thus filling a major gap in existing literature on this period.

This volume offers an eyewitness account of life in the classical world. The author has selected a series of telling extracts from Greek literature to provide a picture of the customs, concerns and underlying values of the ancient Greeks. The Greeks speak for themselves, both in the formal language of public office and in the colloquial speech of the household and the street. Their words reveal activities and opinions which are sometimes remarkably similar to those of the modern day, but which are otherwise so different that they are difficult for us to understand. The extracts have been selected from a variety of sources and record not only the lives of famous Greeks, but - perhaps more importantly - offer an insight into the lives of more ordinary individuals. Poetry, hymns and war-songs are included, as are quotations from official documents, inscriptions, laws, histories, funerary monuments, war-memorials and graffiti. This compilation gives an impression of the public and private facets of Greek life, providing an insight into the mentality of the Greeks.

Since their discovery in nineteenth-century Russia, Greco-Scythian artefacts have been interpreted as masterpieces by Greek craftsmen working according to the tastes of the Scythian nomads and creating realistic depictions of their barbarian patrons. Drawing on a broad array of evidence from archaeology, art history and epigraphy to contextualize Greco-Scythian metalwork in ancient society, this volume confronts the deep confusion between ancient representation and historical reality in contemporary engagements with classical culture. It argues that the strikingly life-like figure scenes of Greco-Scythian art were integral to the strategies of a cosmopolitan elite who legitimated its economic dominance by asserting an intermediary cultural position between the steppe inland and the urban centres on the shores of the Black Sea.
Greeks and Parthians investigates urban life across Mesopotamia through to the end of the Parthian Empire. It examines several major ancient cities and establishes that Greek influence was not as pervasive as has been commonly believed.
