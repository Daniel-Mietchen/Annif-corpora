In this bachelor's thesis, environmental risks of Mikkeli Waste Management were studied. The study focused on environmental and health nuisances in the neighbourhood of Metsä-Sairila waste facility and consisted of two parts: a residents survey, and noise measurements at the waste facility and nearby it. The residents survey included questions concerning odour, noise and aesthetic nuisances occurring in the neighbourhood of Metsä-Sairila waste facility. It was delivered to 67 residents living at the maximum distance of 2 km from Metsä-Sairila waste facility. In addition to the questions, the residents were asked to observe environmental and health nuisances during the period June to August 2005 and to write down their observations in an observation form. By the due date 12 questionnaires were returned. With and additional telephone survey, 7 more responses were received. The survey results showed that 53 % of all respondents had not suffered from any nuisances caused by the waste facility. Those who had suffered from some kind of nuisances rated odours and noise the most harmful nuisances in the neighbourhood of Metsä-Sairila. The low response rate may indicate that most of the residents did not consider the survey necessary. In the responses of the survey, noise caused by Metsä-Sairila waste facility was mentioned several times. To study the real noise associated with Metsä-Sairila waste facility operations, noise measurements were carried out.  Noise levels occurring in the neighbourhood of the waste facility during normal operation, as well as during waste wood chipping, were measured. The noise measurements were limited to a maximum distance of 1.4 km from the waste facility. The noise did not exceed the guideline values given for noise (45 dB) either during the normal operation of the waste facility or during waste wood chipping. On the other hand, sounds from the operation of the waste facility were faintly audible in some measurement points, which may disturb some residents. However, there are also other sources of noise in the area, such as traffic on Highway 5 and activities of a nearby recreational park.

E-Business in Nigeria:  A Study of the Challenges Confronting Customers
Oulu UAS educates professionals for the needs of Northern Finland, whose competence corresponds to the needs and development of working life in the region. We react quickly to the changes occurring in working life and the requirements of new competence.    At the degree programme of Information Technology we aim to develop our teaching to include more real-life project work: our curricula include increasingly more company-related projects. This way we are able to provide our students with a more realistic view of the everyday work at companies, and also improve their employment opportunities.    The purpose of this publication is to spread the word about the projects and results achieved by the students and staff of the Information Technology department. In addition to student projects, our department is also involved in many domestic and international projects well worth mentioning. Yearly, our students complete hundreds of thesis and project work. This publication also presents good examples of our successful projects.
