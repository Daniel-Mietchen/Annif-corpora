The earth system
"Until now, numerical modelling of geodynamic processes has been the domain of highly trained mathematicians with long experience of numerical and computational techniques. Now, for the first time, students and new researchers in the Earth Sciences can learn the basic theory and applications from a single, accessible reference text. Assuming only minimal prerequisite mathematical training (simple linear algebra and derivatives) the author provides a solid grounding in the basic mathematical theory and techniques, including continuum mechanics and partial differential equations, before introducing key numerical and modelling methods. Eight well-documented and state-of-the-art visco-elasto-plastic, 2D models are then presented, which allowrobustmodelling of key dynamic processes such as subduction, lithospheric extension, collision, slab break-off, intrusion emplacement, mantle convection and planetary core formation. Incorporating 47 practical exercises and 67MATLABexamples (forwhich codes are available online at www.cambridge.org/gerya) this textbook provides a userfriendly introduction for graduate courses or self-study, and encourages readers to experiment with geodynamic models first hand"--Provided by publisher.
Geology : basics for engineers
"Written as both a textbook and a handy reference, this text deliberately avoids complex mathematics assuming only basic familiarity with geodynamic theory and calculus. Here, the authors have brought together the key numerical techniques for geodynamic modeling, demonstrations of how to solve problems including lithospheric deformation, mantle convection and the geodynamo. Building from a discussion of the fundamental principles of mathematical and numerical modeling, the text moves into critical examinations of each of the different techniques before concluding with a detailed analysis of specific geodynamic applications. Key differences between methods and their respective limitations are also discussed - showing readers when and how to apply a particular method in order to produce the most accurate results. This is an essential text for advanced courses on numerical and computational modeling in geodynamics and geophysics, and an invaluable resource for researchers looking to master cutting-edge techniques. Links to supplementary computer codes are available online"--

"This book presents an innovative new approach to studying source mechanisms of earthquakes, combining theory and observation in a unified methodology, with a key focus on the mechanics governing fault failures. It explains source mechanisms by building from fundamental concepts such as the equations of elasticity theory to more advanced problems including dislocation theory, kinematic models and fracture dynamics. The theory is presented first in student-friendly form using consistent notation throughout, and with full, detailed mathematical derivations that enable students to follow each step. Later chapters explain the widely-used practical modelling methods for source mechanism determination, linking clearly to the theoretical foundations, and highlighting the processing of digital seismological data. Providing a unique balance between application techniques and theory, this is an ideal guide for graduate students and researchers in seismology, tectonophysics, geodynamics and geomechanics, and a valuable practical resource for professionals working in seismic hazard assessment and seismic engineering"--
