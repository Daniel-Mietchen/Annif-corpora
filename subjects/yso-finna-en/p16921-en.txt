The documentary film A Shout into the Wind is a debut film of the Skolt Sámi director Katja Gauriloff. It portrays the present-day reality of the Skolt Sámi people in which modern life and old traditions converge in perfect harmony. This story is told first time by Skolt Sámi people themselves. Veikko Feodoroff is the spokesman for the Skolt Sámi who doesnʼt want to live off the power of money but prefers to get by with what nature provides. He speaks up for his endangered people and sets out to seek support for his project for building a retirement home for the Skolt Sámi. On his journey he meets public officials and politicians from all the way up to the European Parliament.
