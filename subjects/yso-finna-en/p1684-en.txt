This volume offers a systematic account of the effects of globalization on the shipping industry and seafarers' lives. The seafarers' labour market is changing rapidly and this study discusses the challenges encountered in recruitment practices, trade unions and collective bargaining, as well as training, certification and fraudulent certification. Wages, contracts, and tours of duty are also investigated, and the book includes in-depth treatment of seafarer safety and hazard exposure. Innovations such as automated engine rooms and the global maritime distress and safety system, the internationalization of ship registrations, multinational crewing and reductions in crewing levels, and the rise in ship management companies have had a profound effect on seafarers' living and working conditions. This perceptive book examines these and future issues for regulation and enforcement.

"Corto Maltese set the standard for all adult adventure comics in Europe. By the mid-1970s, Corto was the continent's most popular series and Hugo Pratt the world's leading graphic novelist. Hugo Pratt's peripatetic sailor was featured in a series of twenty-nine stories. The adventures of this modern Ulysses are set during the first thirty years of the 20th Century in such exotic locales as Pratt's native Venice, the steppes of Manchuria, the Caribbean islands, the Danakil deserts, the Amazon forests, and the waves of the Pacific." / WolrdCat.

Sail ho! : my early years at sea
In this volume, eminent economist Charles Kindleberger sets out to challenge the widespread belief that the market for seafarers, in the days before steam, was efficient, conforming more or less to a strong prior belief in the neo-classical economic model of supply and demand. Maritime history is traditionally strewn with references to crimping or shanghaiing, naval press-gangs, desertion, mutiny, marooning and shipwrecks due to drunkeness or negligence. In contrast, Kindleberger examines issues of recruitment and pay, the treatment of seamen, and the question of government intervention and its impact on efficiency, in the engaging narrative style that is his trademark. Offering an original and informative account of the markets for seafarers in the age of sail, Mariners and Markets will be welcomed by economic and maritime historians alike.
