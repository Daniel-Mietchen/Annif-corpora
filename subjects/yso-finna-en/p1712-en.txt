"Clinical evidence clearly demonstrates that physical therapeutic measures begun as soon as possible after a stroke, often within 24 to 48 hours, greatly increase everyday competence and quality of life. Physical Therapy for the Stroke Patient: Early Stage Rehabilitation covers all the issues that physical therapists must deal with in this critical period: assessment of patients' abilities; care during the acute phase; early mobilization; effects of medication; risk factors; ethical questions; and much more. It provides complete guidelines on how to examine and treat the patient, the dosage" of physical therapy required, and the key differences between early and late stage rehabilitation after stroke. Special Features Information-packed chapter on Optimizing Functional Motor Recovery after Stroke," written by J. Carr and R. Shepherd, pioneers in the field and the first to correlate motor learning and stroke recovery Case studies throughout the book offering direct, hands-on examples of evaluation and treatment methods Nearly 150 color photographs demonstrating step-by-step physical therapy techniques used in actual practice Hundreds of references to the literature that support the evidence-based approach presented in the book For all physical and occupational therapists who must answer the question, How much therapy will help my patient?", this book provides clear, well-informed answers. Not only will it increase your therapeutic skills and confidence, but it will also expand your knowledge of the medical issues and long-term outcomes for the post-stroke patients in your care"--Provided by publisher.
Distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in developed countries. In patients with complex CAD, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains the preferred treatment as it can provide long-lasting results. However, CABG carries a significant risk of excessive perioperative bleeding and other complications, which may deteriorate the prognosis. Transfusion of blood products is generally used to compensate blood loss. However, both bleeding and blood transfusions have been shown to be associated with an adverse outcome.This cohort study aimed to clarify the impact of perioperative bleeding and the use of different blood products in the development of perioperative complications in 2,764 patients undergoing isolated CABG. The universal definition of perioperative bleeding classification (UDPB) was employed to stratify the severity of bleeding. Additionally, the impact of storage time of transfused red blood cells (RBCs) on the outcome was investigated.Increased UDPB classes, particularly classes 3 and 4, were associated with significantly poorer immediate and late outcome. RBC transfusion in patients who underwent elective off-pump CABG was independently associated with increased troponin I release indicating myocardial injury. Prolonged storage duration of transfused RBCs did not affect immediate and late outcome of patients with moderate bleeding. The most remarkable risk factors for stroke after off-pump CABG were any degree of atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta as well as transfusion of platelets and/or solvent/detergent-treated plasma.The UDPB classification appears to be a promising research tool to stratify the severity of perioperative bleeding and to assess its prognostic impact after coronary surgery. Prevention of major bleeding that leads to blood transfusion may protect from myocardial injury and stroke and possibly result in better ea rly and late outcomes. Patients with a diseased ascending aorta could be considered at high risk of stroke because of their risk of generalized atherosclerosis. In case of mildly diseased aorta, the “no-touch” aorta policy should be considered with the intention of preventing postoperative stroke.

Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (pICH) is a severe, suddenly occurring disease involving high mortality and poor functional outcome. In the absence of curative treatment patient management is mainly supportive with the emphasis on preventing hematoma enlargement and complications. Better understanding of the factors predicting outcome are needed to define effective treatments.An unselected population-based registry study of 982 pICH patients admitted to Oulu University Hospital during the years 1993 to 2008 was conductedThe study revealed that concomitant use of warfarin and serotonin-modulating antidepressants at the time of pICH increases the case fatality rate compared to patients with warfarin alone.An elevated C-reactive protein value on admission was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome after pICH. This association was not explained by pre-existing heart disease, diabetes, severity of the bleeding, or infections.Patients undergoing surgical hematoma evacuation were observed to have improved 3-month survival compared to conservatively treated patients. Improved survival was noticed especially in patients with ≤70 years of age with ≥30ml supratentorial ICHs. Hematoma evacuation did not improve functional outcome.Earlier ischemic stroke was found to be an independent predictor of recurrent pICH. Diabetes seemed to increase and treated hypertension decrease the risk for fatal recurrence. Aspirin or serotonin-modulating antidepressants did not seem to increase the risk of recurrence.
