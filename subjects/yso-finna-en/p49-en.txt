One of the largest and most complex human services systems in history has evolved to address the needs of people with developmental disabilities, yet important questions remain for many professionals, administrators, and parents. What approaches to early intervention, education, therapy, and remediation really help those with autism and other developmental disabilities improve their functioning and adaptation? Alternatively, what approaches represent wastes of time, effort, and resources?Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities, 2nd Edition brings together leading behavioral scientists and practitioners to shed much-needed light on the major controversies surrounding these questions. Expert authors review the origins, perpetuation, and resistance to scrutiny of questionable practices, and offer a clear rationale for appraising the quality of various services.The second edition of Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities has been fully revised and updated and includes entirely new chapters on psychology fads, why applied behavioral analysis isn't a fad, rapid prompting, FAPE advocacy, BCBA practices and beliefs, and teaching ethics. The book concludes with a brief parents guide to autism treatments.

"About one in every thousand babies born each year has clubfoot, a disorder that affects foot and calf muscles. Because treatment usually begins soon after birth and continues for several years, parents play a key role in the treatment of clubfoot and need to be able to communicate effectively with their child's doctor. The Parents' Guide to Clubfoot is the only book about clubfoot that is written for parents so they can learn everything they need to know about their child's condition. It is an all-in-one resource with medical information, advice from parents, comments from clubfoot experts, and even an illustrated story for preschoolers that parents can read aloud to their children. Written in everyday language, the book covers clubfoot in babies and older children from diagnosis through treatment for mild to severe cases. It provides details on clubfoot, its causes, treatment and care, along with an extensive list of resources and clubfoot assessment aids. In keeping with currently preferred treatments in the U.S., it emphasizes the Ponseti method, which minimizes surgery, and includes perspectives from Ponseti-trained clubfoot doctors and parents of children with clubfoot. However, separate chapters discuss all pre-treatment and post-treatment care options and one chapter covers surgery and post-surgery care if it becomes necessary"--
