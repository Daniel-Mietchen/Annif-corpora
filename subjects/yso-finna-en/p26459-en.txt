Multiphonics of the grand piano : timbral composition and performance with flageolets
The orchestral revolution : Haydn and the technologies of timbre
Connects scientific understandings of acoustics with practical applications to musical performance. Of central importance are the tonal characteristics of musical instruments and the singing voice including detailed representations of directional characteristics. Furthermore, room acoustical concerns related to concert halls and opera houses are considered. Based on this, suggestions are made for musical performance. Included are seating arrangements within the orchestra and adaptation of performance techniques to the performance environment. This presentation dispenses with complicated mathematical connections and aims for conceptual explanations accessible to musicians, particularly for conductors. The graphical representations of the directional dependence of sound radiation by musical instruments and the singing voice are unique. This German edition has become a standard reference work for audio engineers and scientists.
