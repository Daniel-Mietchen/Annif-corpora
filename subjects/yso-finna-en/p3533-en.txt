"This book covers the integration of chemical fate modeling for use in Geographic Information System (GIS) functions. It features a practical and hands-on approach that's intended for modelers preparing maps of chemical emissions, and creating landscape and climate properties within a GIS, while chemical fate calculations are performed using specialized model codes. A relevant part of the book also discusses data retrieval and processing as a basis for modeling. As such, the book offers a one-stop reference for practitioners who wish to integrate GIS with chemical modeling"--

In view of improving multi-country forest sector models, this study investigated to what extent the price and income elasticity of demand for forest products had changed in the past two decades, and how much they depended on the countries income level. For each of seven major product groups annual observations were divided between high-income (top 20% in gross domestic product per capita) and low-income, and between recent (2004-2013) and older (1992-2003) observations. The results indicated that for sawnwood and particleboard the data could be pooled across all countries and years. For the other commodity groups (veneer & plywood, fiberboard, newsprint, printing & writing paper, other paper & paperboard), there were statistically significant differences in gross domestic product or price elasticity between high and low-income levels or old and recent observations. Efficient elasticities were obtained by pooling the maximum number of observations while respecting the statistically significant differences. The resulting GDP elasticities were the same, or very close, across income levels for all products. The price elasticities differed by income level only for newsprint and for veneer and plywood. International forest sector projections to 2065 obtained with these elasticities compared with those based on pooling all data across time and income levels gave less than 3% difference for world consumption of sawnwood, particleboard, fiberboard, and newsprint, but 19% higher consumption for veneer and plywood, 31% for printing and writing paper, and 18% for other paper and paperboard. The world price was 1% to 11% higher for end products and 3% to 22% higher for raw materials and intermediate products..

This book provides a hands-on introduction to model-based requirements engineering and management by describing a set of views that form the basis for the approach. These views take into account each individual requirement in terms of its description, but then also provide each requirement with meaning by putting it into the correct 'context'. A requirement that has been put into a context is known as a 'use case' and may be based upon either stakeholders or levels of hierarchy in a system. Each use case must then be analysed and validated by defining a combination of scenarios and formal mathematical and logic-based proofs that provide the rigour required for safety-critical and mission-critical systems. The book also looks at the crucial question of modelling notations for requirements modelling and includes discussions on the use and application of SysML, text and tabular formats. Pragmatic issues, such as tailoring the approach for short, non-critical projects to massive, mission-critical projects is discussed to show how the techniques introduced in the book can be applied on real-life projects and systems. The use of multiple tools will also be discussed, along with examples of how an effective process can lead to realisation by any tool.

In this research, the best measures will be looked into for improving energy efficiency such as optimization of ships' speed, optimal routes planned according to weather conditions, maintenance of hull & machine and etc. All these measures and precautions are considered with the depending of different types of ship, cargo and other effects. Ships' statistical data and detailed information about ship energy efficiency will be gathered from both shipping companies and partner universities. Various statistical methods, operations research and optimization techniques will be employed for the improving energy efficiency of ships. In conclusion, a DSS will be developed for real-time energy monitoring and making optimal decisions during ship operations intended to be used by the captain of the ship and onboard personnel and ship management operators onshore. Thus, the shipping industry will obtain medium to large long-term gains in terms of monetary and environmental benefits as well as strengthening the awareness of the situation for onboard personnel.

Abstract: 3D modeling optimization for multimedia production. This thesis is a research project on the similarities and difference in 3D modeling and optimizations for different sectors of multimedia. The purpose of this project is to analyse three different areas, and carry out a project for practical comparison purposes with the creation of a 3D model using different methods of modeling and optimization. The methods used in this project is a workflow step by step process of production, for later comparison and analysis. The result of this project was the creation of an optimized model for game production, the methods used at modeling pipeline and the comparison between different sectors of Multimedia illustrate the similarities and differences in modeling optimization between these sectors. This project is created to illustrate paths taken for modeling optimization in the biggest sectors of 3D production, with comparative results and analysis.

The arctic region is predicted to experience the earliest and most pronounced global warming response to human-induced climatic change. This book synthesizes information on the physiological ecology of arctic plants, discusses how physiological processes influence ecosystem processes, and explores how climate warming will affect arctic plants, plant communities, and ecosystem processes. It reviews the physiological ecology of arctic plants. It explores biotic controls over community and ecosystems processes. It provides physiological bases for predicting how the Arctic will respond to global climate change.
