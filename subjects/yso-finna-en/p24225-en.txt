The purpose of this thesis was to study, how much energy is used in pumping fluids in each auxiliary system of marine main engine and to choose the system that is the most energy consuming. After choosing one system for closer observation the target was to study how pumping energy efficiency of that specific auxiliary system can be improved by changing the design, but still keeping the original technical limits for the system valid. 9L46 marine main engine was chosen as a reference engine for all calculations and all the component data for each part and unit of different manufacturer was obtained from the TERPS database in Wärtsilä Ship power's intranet page. Based on the calculated results a ballpark economical estimate of investment difference between a normal system and an energy efficient system was made.
