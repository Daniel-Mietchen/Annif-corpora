The goal of this thesis was to design and implement a functional network infrastructure for a small and medium sized business environment using primarily technologies offered by Cisco Systems, Inc. Some basic networking concepts were covered first to provide the reader with a general understanding of common network principles and technologies addressed during the course of this thesis. Network requirements and technical goals were defined for the hypothetical target business environment according to modern business network trends and demands. The network requirements refer to more particular specifications such as the amount of users, whereas the technical goals present more generalized objectives such as scalability and availability. The design process of the network was started by designing a logical topology of the network using the previously specified requirements and goals. With these requirements and goals again in mind, an implementation plan was devised that presents specific technologies and techniques to be used in the implementation. Suitable network devices were chosen and addressing and naming schemes were designed according to the implementation plan. The implementation of network features is presented in detail, followed by testing of the final operational network. Several test cases are presented with pictures to illustrate the successful tests.

In this thesis, I concentrate on the use and marketing of survey applications in Finnish markets. The research population consists of small and medium-sized companies in the greater Helsinki area. My research problem is based on Haagasurvey Oy's fast growth: the company that catapulted from a student project to market leader has maintained its goal of maximum profit through continuous prospecting. At the same time, it has suffered from a lack of customer feedback, which is needed to improve both its customer service and product development. In the theoretical part, I will focus on service marketing and will analyze the nature of services by describing the interfaces between the service provider and the customer. These interfaces will clarify what the service provider should take into consideration when providing for a customer's production-enhancing needs, while realizing that customers may have different reactions to the images and feelings that the given service evokes. In essence, I set out to chart those things that would give indications of the right marketing measures at Haagasurvey Oy. I cannot generalize my survey results because of the small response rate, but the responses will support my experiences as Haagasurvey Oy's Sales Manager. Currently, Haagasurvey Oy is carrying out broader customer satisfaction research together with professional guidance, due to the questions I put forward in this thesis. In other words, my initial work has apparently been of some tangible value. There are also indications that Haagasurvey Oy is transforming itself into a more consultative organization, as opposed to a sales-oriented one, which I think is a positive sign of future developments.
