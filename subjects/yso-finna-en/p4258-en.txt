Over the years, tourism has become one of largest industries in the world. It has boosted national economy, reduced economy trade deficit as well as helped country's development in many countries. However, with the sheer size of the industry, it generates a great deal of solid and liquid wastes from tourism operations. Consequently, it causes serious environmental degradation. As tourism depends heavily on nature, there is a need to care for it; for the survival of future tourism. Organic waste management, under the umbrella of environmental management, is an effective tool for this role. Acknowledging the importance of this tool in the hotel sector, the author has asked the questions, “ What are the economic benefits of organic waste management in hotels' operations in tourism destination”, and set research objectives to find out whether some hotels gain economic benefits from such management. The chosen sampling is Green Leaf Hotels, hotels practicing it in Thailand.    Within the literature consulted by the author, many studies have identified several benefits from managing organic wast. This study focuses on three issues: first, helping hotels to save money on cost reduction; second, enabling hotels to gain other income from the organic-waste-by-products; third helping hotels to increase competitiveness in part of marketing and pricing strategy.    One of the main purposes of this study is to educate and form basic understanding to hotels about potential economic benefits of organic waste management in their businesses. Therefore, a qualitative study is the most suitable research position. The online questionnaire was judged the most appropriate methodology, as it allows the author to conduct research and gather primary data from Thailand, while living in Finland. In the process of data analysis, this research usedcaptive case study as it permits the author to concentrate on a specific and relevant group of sampling.    The author was able to collect 33 responses. This number is not statistically enough to cross compare the Thai and international hotels, as one goal set for this study. Thus, the data was instead analyzed based on their level of the organic waste management approaches employed in hotels: and the author further discussed how much these hotels gain economic benefits, in relation to their level of effort in organic waste management.     The author spent time during September 2009-May 2010 to complete the whole study; the content was written only during January to May 2010.

"Shows how images of feminized sexuality in novels by George Eliot and Thomas Hardy reflected widespread contemporary anxieties about the growth of capitalism. Economic Woman is the first book to address directly the links between classical political economy and gender in the novel. Examining key works by Eliot and Hardy, including The Mill on the Floss and Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Kreisel investigates the meaning of two female representations: the 'economic woman,' who embodies idealized sexual restraint and wise domestic management, and the degraded prostitute, characterized by sexual excess and economic turmoil."--Publisher description.
An increasing number of organizations have realized the importance of professionally planned and implemented purchasing. For this reason, more and more research is conducted in the field of the purchasing process in the restaurant industry. Small restaurant operations, which have similarities as well as differences with larger restaurants and restaurant chains, can also achieve better financial performance by executing a better purchasing process. Unfortunately, the research into small restaurant purchasing is not as mature as the research into other operations in the industry.      The aim of this research-based thesis is to understand what an economical purchasing process for small restaurants is.The research problem of this study is: 'what is the purchasing process that gives the optimum performance with minimum requirement of time, money and resources for small restaurant operations?'  In order to achieve the aim, first of all, the previous literature was studied and a literature framework was built. The resources that were used for the literature review are the books and online sources, as well as journals and theses from Haaga-Helia's Library.     After the literature studies, the research proceeds into the empirical research stage. This research position of this thesis is qualitative methodology. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in order to obtain and collect the data needed for this research. The interviewees selected were all restaurant professionals who have long-stand experiences in working as small restaurant managers. The interview questions were designed based on the literature review.     After the research carried out, data from interviews were transcribed, coded and organized for the purpose of analysis. Important findings are presented in chapter 4, the findings are analyzed in the same chapter. Findings and analysis helped the author to deepen the understandings on this topic.     In the conclusion chapter, based on the literature study of previous research and outcomes from empirical research, the 'economical purchasing process' was built for small restaurants. A model of the purchasing process was built up to visualize the research conclusion. In addition, findings of how to improve small restaurant purchasing were concluded as suggestions to small restaurant managers in chapter 5.

"After the last set of business scandals and financial busts, many powerful interests and many influential people are asking questions about doing more with less, from governments to multinational corporations; they are seeking this realignment in hopes of regaining their balance. Doing More with Less is an actionable call to arms, with global insights -- that are of immediate application to professionals in any industry -- into new ways to better align money, people, and rules. Author, Bruce Piaceski, convincingly lays out the case for a return to frugality, providing relevant examples from his thirty years of experience as a management consultant and change agent. Piaceski deftly explains how this approach to competition is relevant, and provides readers with the framework to look at what's next without tottering toward failure"--
