The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the evolution of third generation mobile networks from certification laboratory point of view and to draw conclusions about affects of LTE to laboratory. Certification laboratory performs conformance testing to fulfill requirements set by certification scheme. Requirement consists of defined standards.3GPP is a standardization organization producing GSM/UMTS family standards, therefore this thesis deals with its creation and general structure as well as working group methods of standard creation processes. WCDMA technology development is handled in general and also with comparison to previous GSM technology networks in order to give a more comprehensive view to digital mobile systems. UMTS system architecture and LTE physical layer is highlighted due to the fact that it has a major impact to testing methods and processes. LTE Conformance testing specification is described in section level and conclusions of laboratory impacts are presented. Through this thesis work it became evident that due to the numerous changes in LTE network architecture, transmission schemes, physical channels and protocol stacks new type of test platforms are needed for the conformance testing purposes. Therefore certification laboratory needs to trigger multiple processes related to follow up vendor activities and to ensure staff competence in relations to new standard requirements.

This book uses the theoretical framework of information economics to analyze the translation profession. In particular, the economic concepts of asymmetric information and adverse selection are utilized. Due to the problem of asymmetric information, it is sometimes argued that when translation service buyers need to recruit new translators, they cannot effectively distinguish between a “good” translator and a “bad” one and hence tend to pay a price that is below the level when there is perfect and complete information. As a result, “good” translators may leave the translation profession. It is sometimes suggested that a translator certification system can act as an effective signal to differentiate between “good” translators and “bad” translators. A triangulation method is employed in this study to investigate the translator certification system and its signaling effects, using a number of research procedures (corpus analysis, questionnaire surveys, an experiment using fictitious résumés and interviews). This study should be valuable to those working in the translation profession as well as people who are interested in the complex and ever-changing global translation market.
