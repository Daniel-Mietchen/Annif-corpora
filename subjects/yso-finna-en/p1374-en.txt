Heterocycles in life and society : an introduction to heterocyclic chemistry, biochemistry and applications
Principles and techniques of practical biochemistry
"Heterocycles in Life and Society is an introduction to the chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, focusing on their origin and occurrence in nature, biochemical significance and wide range of applications. Written in a readable and accessible style, the book takes a multidisciplinary approach to this extremely important area of organic chemistry. Topics covered include an introduction to the structure and properties of heterocycles; the key role of heterocycles in important life processes such as the transfer of hereditary information, how enzymes function, the storage and transport of bioenergy, and photosynthesis; applications of heterocycles in medicine, agriculture and industry; heterocycles in supramolecular chemistry; the origin of heterocycles on primordial Earth; and how heterocycles can help us solve 21st century challenges. For this second edition, Heterocycles in Life and Society has been completely revised and expanded, drawing on a decade of innovation in heterocyclic chemistry. The new edition includes discussions of the role of heterocycles in nanochemistry, green chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, molecular devices and sensors, and supramolecular chemistry. Impressive achievements include the creation of various molecular devices, the recording and storage of information, the preparation of new organic conductors, and new effective drugs and pesticides with heterocyclic structures. Much new light has been thrown on various life processes, while the chemistry of heterocycles has expanded to include new types of heterocyclic structures and reactions, and the use of heterocyclic molecules as ionic liquids and proton sponges. Heterocycles in Life and Society is an essential guide to this important field for students and researchers in chemistry, biochemistry, and drug discovery, and scientists at all levels wishing to expand their scientific horizon."--

Extensively revised, the fourth edition of this highly successful book takes into account the many newly determined protein structures that provide molecular insight into chemiosmotic energy transduction, as well as reviewing the explosive advances in 'mitochondrial physiology'-the role of the mitochondria in the life and death of the cell. Covering mitochondria, bacteria and chloroplasts, the fourth edition of Bioenergetics provides a clear and comprehensive account of the chemiosmotic theory and its many applications. The figures have been carefully designed to be memorable and to convey the key functional and mechanistic information. Written for students and researchers alike, Bioenergetics is the most well-known, current and respected text on chemiosmotic theory and membrane bioenergetics available. Chapters are now divided between three interlocking sections: basic principles, structures and mechanisms, and mitochondrial physiology. Covers new advances in the structure and mechanism of key bioenergetic proteins, including complex I of the respiratory chain and transport proteins.Details cellular bioenergetics, mitochondrial cell biology and signal transduction, and the roles of mitochondria in physiology, disease and aging.Offers readers clear, visual representation of structural concepts through full colour figures throughout the book.
