"Master the Art of Electronics Repair In this hands-on guide, a lifelong electronics repair guru shares his tested techniques and invaluable insights. How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic shows you how to repair and extend the life of all kinds of solid-state devices, from modern digital gadgetry to cherished analog products of yesteryear.You'll start by selecting the tools and test equipment you'll need and setting up your workbench. Then, you'll get familiar with components and how they form circuits, stages, and sections of a device. Next, you'll learn how to take a product apart, figure out what's wrong with it, replace components, and reassemble it. Real-world case studies help clarify the topics covered. Tips and tricks for specific devices, such as optical disc players, computers, and video recorders, are also included in this practical resource. Set up a workbench and equip it with tools and test instruments Ensure personal safety and avoid electrical and physical damage to devices Understand electrical units, circuits, and signals Use test equipment, including a digital multimeter, signal generator, frequency counter, and an oscilloscope Repair circuit boards and replace parts Work with components, from capacitors and ICs to transistors and zeners Learn to read block, schematic, and pictorial diagrams Disassemble devices and identify sections and stages Troubleshoot and diagnose to the component level Perform reverse-order reassembly".

"This book recognizes that correctly done FMEAs are essential to achieving high quality and reliability in products and processes, and are the central core of Design for Six Sigma, Design for Reliability and other Quality and Reliability programs. The Objective of the book is to define the correct procedure for doing FMEAs and to outline specifically how to successfully apply the FMEA procedure in design, development, manufacturing, and service applications. The book will also share the most common mistakes in doing FMEAs and how to turn these into quality objectives, as well as how to implement effective FMEA processes in companies. It is a practical book showing both the practitioner and manager the key elements of successful FMEA systems. It is based upon the author's extensive experience with thousands of FMEAs, and a many dozen of companies. The reader will understand how to do FMEA correctly, and how to implement effective FMEA programs"--
