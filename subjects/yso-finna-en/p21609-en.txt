Botulinum toxin A treatment in children with spastic cerebral palsy : studies on injection techniques and doses
Skeletal muscle structure, function, and plasticity : the physiological basis of rehabilitation
Improving hand function in children with cerebral palsy : theory, evidence and intervention
In its third edition, this text addresses basic and applied physiological properties of skeletal muscle in the context of the physiological effects from clinical treatment. Anyone interested in human movement analysis and the understanding of generation and control from the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems in implementing movement will find this a valuable resource. A highlight color has been added to this edition's updated figures and tables, and the color plates section has been doubled, ensuring that all figures that need color treatment to clarify concepts receive this treatment. A new Clinical Problem feature uses concepts presented in each chapter in the context of a specific clinical case-for example, a spinal cord injury, a sports accident, or rehabilitation after bed rest.
