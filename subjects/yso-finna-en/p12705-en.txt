The aim of this thesis was to prepare polyelectrolyte thin films by spin coating and to determine the surface free energy of the films. The surface free energy was calculated by means of contact angle measurements. The studied polyelectrolytes have applications such as organic solar cells and organic light emitting diodes. Surface free energy is related to the integrity of the thin film laminate structures used in various applications. Thin films were prepared on a glass substrate whose surface was activated by plasma treatment followed by a spin coating procedure. Thin films were prepared of four different polyelectrolytes (PIMa, PIMb, PT1 and PT2), each in two different dissolutions: water and water-dioxane (50:50 v:v). The films were thermally annealed before the contact angle measurements. For contact angle measurement, four different probe liquids were used, namely glycerol, formamide, ethylene glycol, and diiodomethane. Surface free energy and its polar and dispersive components were calculated based on the contact angle measurements. Glass slides without any polymer film, treated with water and water-dioxane, were used as blanks. Thin film height profile was measured by atomic force microscopy after scratching the surface. The obtained results show that methods for surface free energy determination by contact angle measurement are not standardized and there are several details to consider for successful measurement.

""If I could take what I've learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine was worthwhile. I'm already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you, but also my future glory in having stopped you from trying an expensive juice cleanse or thinking that it was your fault when the person you are dating suddenly backs away, intimidated by the clarity of your personal mission here on earth. No, I am not a sexpert, a psychologist or a dietician. I am not a mother of three or the owner of a successful hosiery franchise. But I am a girl with a keen interest in having it all, and what follows are hopeful dispatches from the frontlines of that struggle.""--

"Distribution Revolution is a collection of interviews with leading film and TV professionals concerning the many ways that digital delivery systems are transforming the entertainment business. These interviews provide lively insider accounts from studio executives, distribution professionals, and creative talent of the tumultuous transformation of film and TV in the digital era. The first section features interviews with top executives at major Hollywood studios, providing a window into the big-picture concerns of media conglomerates with respect to changing business models, revenue streams, and audience behaviors. The second focuses on innovative enterprises that are providing path-breaking models for new modes of content creation, curation, and distribution-creatively meshing the strategies and practices of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. And the final section offers insights from creative talent whose professional practices, compensation, and everyday working conditions have been transformed over the past ten years. Taken together, these interviews demonstrate that virtually every aspect of the film and television businesses is being affected by the digital distribution revolution, a revolution that has likely just begun. Interviewees include: Gary Newman, Chairman, 20th Century Fox Television; Kelly Summers, Former Vice President, Global Business Development and New Media Strategy, Walt Disney Studios; Thomas Gewecke, Chief Digital Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Business Development, Warner Bros.

One of the first books to explore Russian cinema in the new millennium, this volume captures the emergence of a new cinematic sensibility and interprets it through the framework of the symbolic mode. Analysing films by established directors such as Sokurov, Zviagintsev and Zel'dovich, as well as lesser-known filmmakers like Balabanov, Fedorchenko and Kalatozishvili, Contemporary Russian Cinema: Symbols of a New Era explores the particular style of film presentation that has emerged in Russia since 2000, characterized by its use of highly abstract concepts and visual language. Whether directed towards a mystical world, or even towards an afterlife, the symbolic mode defines the emergence of a specific mindscape which has escaped previous representational forms, and is intrinsically linked to Russia's dramatic political and economic development since the turn of the 21st century.
