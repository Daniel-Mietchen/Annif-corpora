The art of noise offers an unprecedented collection of insightful, of-the-moment conversations with twenty-seven of the great songwriters. They discuss everything from their individual approaches to writing, to the inspiration behind their most successful songs, to the techniques and methods they have independently developed to foster their creativity. Contributors include: Sting, Ray Davies, Robin Gibb, Jimmy Page, Joan Armatrading, Noel Gallagher, Lily Allen, Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn, Noel Gallagher, Laura Marling, Paul Weller, Johnny Marr, and many more. Each interview is approached with depth of understanding--of the practice of songwriting, but also of each musician's catalog. The result is a collection of conversations that's probing, informed, and altogether entertaining--what contributor Noel Gallagher called "without doubt the finest book I've ever read about songwriters and the songs they write." The collected experience of these artists makes this book the essential word on songwriting--as spoken by the songwriters themselves.
