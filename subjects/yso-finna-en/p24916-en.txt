The knowing organization : how organizations use information to construct meaning, create knowledge and make decisions
The German word for experience - Erlebnis - the experience of the life, to live through something...underpins this book: making visible scholarly opportunities for richer and deeper contextualizations and examinations of the lived-world experiences of people in everyday contexts as they be, do and become.'(Ross Todd, Preface) Information experience is a burgeoning area of research and still unfolding as an explicit research and practice theme. This book is therefore very timely as it distils the reflections of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, with interests ranging across information, knowledge, user experience, design and education. They cast a fresh analytical eye on information experience, whilst approaching the idea from diverse perspectives. Information Experience brings together current thinking about the idea of information experience to help form discourse around it and establish a conceptual foundation for taking the idea forward. It therefore, 'provides a number of theoretical lenses for examining people's information worlds in more holistic and dynamic ways.' (Ross Todd, Preface).

The distraction addiction : getting the information you need and the communication you want without enraging your family, annoying your colleagues, and destroying your soul
The question of our time: can we reclaim our lives in an age that feels busier and more distracting by the day? We have all found ourselves checking email at the dinner table, holding our breath while waiting for Outlook to load, or sitting hunched in front of a screen for an hour longer than we intended. Mobile devices and the web have invaded our lives, and this is a big idea book that addresses one of the biggest questions of our age: can we stay connected without diminishing our intelligence, attention spans, and ability to really live? Can we have it all? Here the author, a Stanford University technology guru, says yes. His book is packed with fascinating studies, compelling research, and crucial takeaways. Whether it is breathing while Facebook refreshes, or finding creative ways to take a few hours away from the digital crush, this book is about the ways to tune in without tuning out. - Publisher.
