Abstract.
"Psychology of Sustainability: An Applied Perspective examines the many psychological factors that lead to human behavioral effects on the environment. Because applied psychology is concerned with defining criteria and finding precursor variables that can be manipulated, this textbook is neatly structured to represent the principles of applied psychology. Each chapter will apply elements from a basic research area into the context of criteria specific to sustainability. Until recently, applied psychology received minimal attention from professors and professionals in sustainability. At the same time, increased interest has led many universities to offer courses on "Psychology of Sustainability." This book is the perfect text to provide an introduction to the subject. Throughout the book, readers will find new ways of framing questions related to human adaptability and evolutionary psychology. Psychology of Sustainability is ideal for students or professionals who are looking to contribute to the conversation"--

Managing information system security
Human Behavior in the Social Environment (HBSE) is a critical course for social work students because it introduces them to the very specific person-in-environment, biopsychosocial perspective that sets social work apart from other helping professions. Authored by the foremost scholars in the field, this book takes a theoretical approach to human behavior in the social environment and covers all the major theories--from cognitive behavioral to family systems to psychosocial. Aligned with social work accreditation standards (EPAS), this book provides social work students with thorough coverage of human behavior at every level of interaction.

"The Final Volume of the Groundbreaking Trilogy on Agent-Based ModelingIn this pioneering synthesis, Joshua Epstein introduces a new theoretical entity: Agent Zero. This software individual, or "agent," is endowed with distinct emotional/affective, cognitive/deliberative, and social modules. Grounded in contemporary neuroscience, these internal components interact to generate observed, often far-from-rational, individual behavior. When multiple agents of this new type move and interact spatially, they collectively generate an astonishing range of dynamics spanning the fields of social conflict, psychology, public health, law, network science, and economics.Epstein weaves a computational tapestry with threads from Plato, Hume, Darwin, Pavlov, Smith, Tolstoy, Marx, James, and Dostoevsky, among others. This transformative synthesis of social philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and agent-based modeling will fascinate scholars and students of every stripe. Epstein's computer programs are provided in the book or on its Princeton University Press website, along with movies of his "computational parables." Agent Zero is a signal departure in what it includes (e.g., a new synthesis of neurally grounded internal modules), what it eschews (e.g., standard behavioral imitation), the phenomena it generates (from genocide to financial panic), and the modeling arsenal it offers the scientific community. For generative social science, Agent Zero presents a groundbreaking vision and the tools to realize it"--

"This book takes a new angle on a much-studied phenomenon, focusing on the role of domination and identity construction, understanding and self-knowledge, moral transformation and the social community, systems of training and hierarchy used by schooling, and the role they play in bullying. Exploring typical narratives of value within schooling (i.e., who counts and who doesn't?), the volume shows how bullying might make sense to a student as a pathway of identity construction within such stories (discourses and practices taken up by schools). It suggests how we can "tell a new story" and create a new culture which might undermine, or close off, the allure of bullying as a "need-meeting" avenue for students within schools"--

"How do otherwise considerate human beings do cruel things and still live in peace with themselves? Drawing on his agentic theory, Dr. Bandura provides a definitive exposition of the psychosocial mechanism by which people selectively disengage their moral self-sanctions from their harmful conduct. They do so by sanctifying their harmful behavior as serving worthy causes; they absolve themselves of blame for the harm they cause by displacement and diffusion of responsibility; they minimize or deny the harmful effects of their actions; and they dehumanize those they maltreat and blame them for bringing the suffering on themselves. Dr. Bandura's theory of moral disengagement is uniquely broad in scope. Theories of morality focus almost exclusively at the individual level. He insightfully extends the disengagement of morality to the social-system level through which large-scale inhumanities are perpetrated...Moral disengagement will transform your thinking about how otherwise considerate people can behave inhumanely and still feel good about themselves." -- Book jacket.
