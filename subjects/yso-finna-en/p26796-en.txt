The science and commerce of whisky
Raw spirit : in search of the perfect dram
As a native of Scotland, bestselling author Iain Banks has decided to undertake a tour of the distilleries of his homeland in a bid to uncover the unique spirit of the single malt. Visiting some of the world's most famous distilleries and also some of its smallest and most obscure ones, Banks embarks on a journey of discovery which educates him about the places, people and products surrounding the centuries-old tradition of whisky production. Using various modes of transport - ferries to the islands, cars across the highlands, even bicycles between bus stops - Banks' tour of Scotland combines history, literature and landscape in an entertaining and informative account of an exploration in which the arrival is by no means the most important part of the journey.

It includes profiles of key players in the distilling world and hundreds of ideas for how to drink gin, whether it is as a cocktail, in a classic gin & tonic or neat, or as an aperitif or liqueur." --
