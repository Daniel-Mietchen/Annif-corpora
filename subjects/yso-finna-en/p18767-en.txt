"Unlike other texts on the subject, this book aims to provide a well-integrated approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the pervasive effects of the mind/body splitting that lead to somatoform disorders. Kradin explores the spectrum of currently recognized disorders with reference to the DSM-V formulations, as well as the medical, psychobiological, psychodynamic, and cognitive-behavioral approaches to these disorders. Additionally, he explores the role of developmental trauma in pathogenesis, and how stress, modulation, body-oriented therapies, Jungian-oriented embodied imaginal work, and psychopharmacological interventions can be integrated in the treatment of these disorders"--Provided by publisher.
