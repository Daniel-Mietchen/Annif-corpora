"Ethical Problems and Genetics Practice provides a rich, case-based account of the ethical issues arising in the genetics clinic and laboratory. By analysing a wide range of evocative and often arresting cases from practice, Michael Parker provides a compelling insight into the complex moral world of the contemporary genetics professional and the challenges they face in the care of patients and their families. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the ethical issues arising in everyday genetics practice. Ethical Problems and Genetics Practice is also a sustained engagement with the relationships between bioethics and social science. In proposing and exemplifying a new approach to bioethics, it makes a significant contribution to debates on methods and interdisciplinarity and will therefore also appeal to all those concerned with theoretical and methodological approaches to bioethics and social science"--

This collection of essays looks at how human heredity was understood between 1900 and the late 1970s. Developments are explored across three themed sections; concepts, practices, and institutions.

Classical genetic research and its legacy : the mapping cultures of twentieth-century genetics
A magnificent history of the gene and a response to the defining question of the future: What becomes of being human when we learn to "read" and "write" our own genetic information? Siddhartha Mukherjee has a written a biography of the gene as deft, brilliant, and illuminating as his extraordinarily successful biography of cancer. Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.

"Biotechnology is delivering not only new products to diagnose, prevent, and treat human diseases but entirely new approaches to a wide range of difficult biomedical challenges. Because of advances in biotechnlogy, hundreds of new therapeutic agents, diagnostic tests, and vaccines have been developed and are available in the marketplace. In this jargon-free, easy-to-read textbook, the authors demystify the discipline of medical biotechnology and provide a fundamental understanding of the wide-ranging approaches pursued by scientists to diagnose, prevent, and treat medical conditions."--Back cover.
