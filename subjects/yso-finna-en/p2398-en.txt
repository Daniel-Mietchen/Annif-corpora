This paper provides a general assessment of transport network of the St.Petersburg region and examines the possibilities for collaboration between Russia and Finland in utilizing and enhancing the function of this network.Treating transport infrastructure as a precondition to certain forms of international economic relations, the authors argue that in recent years the transport network under review has become increasingly inadequate to handle the changing and growing needs of economic collaboration between the two countries. Nevertheless, prospects for the future are not entirely gloomy. Russia, Finland and many other countries stand to benefit substantially from the development of the transport infrastructure in the St.Petersburg region.Therefore a number of joint projects have currently been started to remedy the situation. .

Abstract: Designing an automatic recommendation system for a web based social e-learning application. The purpose of this study was to create a prototype of an automatic recommendation system to demonstrate how recommendation systems work, what the possible pitfalls are and how they can be avoided. The results were evaluated from Bitville's web based social learning application's point of view. First the concept of social e-learning is introduced. Then the technology and the taxonomy of the recommendation system are presented. Some of the mathematical tools that are the base of recommendation engines are introduced and it is shown how they can be used in applications. The outcome of the study was a working prototype that was built on the same programming framework as Bitville's social e-learning application, thus it can be incorporated. With the prototype it was proven that it is possible to build a recommendation engine that takes into account the ratings of the users for different content items and in this way bringing the social element into the recommendation process.

The research problem for this thesis was provided by Rautaruukki Oyj. The purpose of this thesis was to study how modern intelligent wireless local area network monitoring methods and tools could be used to improve WLAN monitoring and functionality at Ruukki Metals steel factory. The research for this thesis was mainly done by studying research papers and articles but also by interviewing specialists and by participating in meetings and presentations. The research was concentrating on different monitoring methods for wireless local area networks and also on the features and characteristics of the selected monitoring software and Ruukki Metals steel factory network environment. The demonstration project was carried out to demonstrate and test the intelligent network monitoring in realistic conditions. The project environment was constructed for Ruukki Metals steel factory site in Raahe, it enabled the possibility to test the capabilities of the intelligent WLAN monitoring tool in an actual factory environment. As well as the existing WLAN network at Ruukki Metals factory, the demonstration project environment was assembled by using Cisco WLAN products. Cisco Prime Infrastructure software was selected as the monitoring tool for the project.The results of the research show that intelligent network monitoring tools are beneficial in monitoring wireless local area networks at a steel factory environment. By using intelligent network monitoring tools, network monitoring and managing becomes more efficient and the function of the network can be improved. Future research possibilities related to this research could relate to improving network monitoring and network reliability. For example effects of using directional antennas and dedicated spectrum analyzators as part of a network monitoring environment. Testing different antenna types and installation positions would provide useful information about what kind of impact they would have on interference tolerance and the range of access points.

Abstract: E-teaching administrative system. The aim of the project was to develop a web application that converts the traditional method of studying and cooking which was done physically in the presence of students into an electronic form that will enhance self-studies. The goal of the project owner was have a user friendly interface of a web application that emulates the traditional teaching method but requires little work to make teaching materials available to the end users. To be able to reach the target of the owner, various content management system platforms that organize all data and allow easy creation of new content and update of already existing ones were explored. This forms the base of which the project application is built. The choice of the content management platform was based first on my previous knowledge and then the preference of the owner. To gain full control of the system, a user must have the credentials to log in. The thesis focuses on how a login administrator can easily create new cooking recipe into the database and display them in the front page, delete and update content, and for all other users to add recipe ingredients to a shopping cart. E-teaching services have seen growth over the years which cannot be over-looked and as long as technology exists, the growth will continue. Various processes were followed and the outcome of the end product was satisfactory to the project owner.

number of nodes, versus quadratic for common techniques. SBS algorithm is analyzed through simulations, showing equal performance compared to the state of the art at significantly lower complexity in communication. After estimating pairwise distances, a localization algorithm, based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), is applied on range data in order to find node positions. Localization algorithm estimates the relative locations of network nodes with respect to some other nodes or their absolute locations in a global coordinate system. Different centralized and distributed localization algorithms are studied and their performances are compared in simulation examples.

Performance evaluation and modeling of peer-to-peer systems over mobile ad hoc networks
Today, industries and consumer markets are increasingly using services exposed from wireless sensor and actuator networks. Such systems are here referred to as cyber-physical machine-to-machine systems. These systems rely on the capability to communicate, compute, monitor and control by using information. The motivation for the present research arises from problems detected in the remote interaction with embedded devices over dynamic wireless networks in such systems. The problems are caused by the heterogeneity of devices, networks and operating environments, mobility, dynamic presence, security demands of the owners and of use, multiple radios, unreliability, dynamic topologies, and changes happening in the system.The approach selected in this research to address these problems is based on the application of the small-world paradigm to cyber-physical systems. The small-world paradigm is based on the observation that people are often linked in a successful social communication chain by, on average, six intermediate steps. In the present study, it is assumed that the concept of small world can be expanded to also cover communication with wireless embedded devices in cyber-physical systems context. In addition, it is expected that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world paradigm, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking.The main contributions of this research are the technical enablers referred to as dynamic communication spaces, dynamic M2M service spaces, configuration and remote use of services, communication overlay, access systems selection, integrated mobility, secure ad hoc networking, situated opportunistic communication, hierarchical networking for small-world networks, and short-cuts for network optimization. Each of the provided technical enablers contributes towards making remote interaction withembedded devices over dynamic wireless networks possible. The enablers have been evaluated as separate technical methods and means by means of experiments and/or simulations. On the basis of the analysis and synthesis, it was established that they work well as separate building blocks and that they can be combined to expand the concept of small world to also cover communication with embedded devices. Furthermore, it was established that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world concept, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking. In addition, weak links were observed to be essential in the small-world neighbour discovery process. In sum, the evaluation results indicate that the provided enablers help the remote interaction with embedded devices and promote the application of the smallworld concept to dynamic wireless cyber-physical systems.
