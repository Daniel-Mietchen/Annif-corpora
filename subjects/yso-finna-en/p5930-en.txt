Inspired by the idea of the 'wunderkammer' ('wonder-room') or 'cabinet of curiosities' that originated during the Renaissance, world-renowned architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien invited 35 celebrated architects and designers from around the world to create their own wunderkammers, filling boxes with objects that inspire them. This book gathers together the varied, evocative wunderkammers along with accompanying statements by their architect-creators.
