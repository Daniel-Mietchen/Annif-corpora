Analysis of wood transport costs in the Zanzibar forest development project
The Finnish sawmill industry has been placed in a predicament due to changes in the business environment since the 1990s. Along the predicament, the industry has shifted its focus on customer-oriented products from production-oriented products. This can be a manifestation of a surge of value-adding strategy which aims to add premium value on products and has been emphasized in academia. Studies on the effects of value-adding strategy on financial performances are very few and no studies have taken into account the existence of strategic groups in the industry. This study scrutinizes the effects of value-adding strategy as well as cost levels of Finnish sawmills on their financial performances with information of strategic groups. The study employs multiple linear regression analysis and cluster analysis to analyze financial performance and of 180 Finnish sawmills from 2002 to 2011, although not all the data was utilized due to lack of certain information. The study found that value-adding activity positively impacts the performance, especially in the longer term. In addition, investment in the previous year as a mean to implement value-adding strategy can enhance the performance of a firm. As for the costs side, higher material cost and salary generally hamper the performance in the short term. However, the study found the positive effect of salary that improves the performance when the information of strategic groups is taken into account. Although it is impossible to tell which components of salary contribute performance due to the nature of the data that the study used, the importance of investing in human resource should be acknowledged.

Japanese forestry and its implications
Wooden furniture industry is a traditional low-technology based and labor intensive industry (Kaplinsky & Readman, 2000), which is highly recommended for global outsourcing. Besides, the raising of "China plus one" manufacturing strategy made Southeast Asian countries became new investment destinations. In case of Vietnam, the largest exporter of wood products in Southeast Asian, wooden furniture industry is highly export-oriented with a fast growing rate especially since 2008 (MARD, 2012). While the global economic crisis in 2008 has a vital impact on the national economy, it is reported that the foreign subsidiaries in furniture industry in Vietnam have outstripped their local competitors (VNS, 2013). Despite the importance of foreign subsidiaries in Vietnam, there is lack of study regarding their competitive advantage and strategy. Investigating on how foreign subsidiaries respond to the external challenges is essential to support strategic knowledge on managing industry? Under the influence of market turbulence. This empirical study used qualitative data from interviews with eight managers of foreign furniture processing subsidiaries in Vietnam. Results indicated that under the influences of global downturn, managers have become more proactive and flexible in their strategic planning when facing with chaotic turbulence, which brings both opportunities and challenges. The study pointed out that the negative impact of global recession was passed through in later time in low-cost manufacturing countries and business risks could be minimized especially in companies with a strong pool of intangible resources (reputation, technology, innovation capability). Despite its complexity, recession was not completely seen a threat, yet the managers perceived it as external turbulence from which organizations can benefit but only if they choose the right strategic orientation.
