It is estimated that roughly 1000 new ecological and environmental models join the ranks of the scientific literature each year. The international peer-reviewed literature reports some 20,000 new models spanning the period from 1970-2010. Just to keep abreast of the field it is necessary to design a handbook of models that doesn't merely list them, but rather draws the state-of-the-art development of models for ecosystem and environmental management. Published first in 1996, Handbook of Models Applied in Ecosystem and Environmental Management applies precisely this approach to review current m.

The aim of this thesis was to study the energy consumption at the plant of Genencor International Inc. in Hanko. The intention was to develop a monitoring system for energy consumption anf energy efficiency covering steam and electricity. based on the survay, the purpose was to find potential energy savings and to improve the efficient use of energy by monitoring and narrowing the grey area of energy consumption. The distribution of energy was identifies and the most significant energy consumers were selected for more detailed analysis. The data collection version was developed on Excel whereas the visual version of the consumption system was created by using the OSI-PI software. In the consumption monitoring system are considered the most significant energy consumers and the biggest products. The energy consumption was calculated in theory and compared to the total use of energy. The error between the theoretical and the actual consumption was taken into account in the error consideration. The extent of the grey area proved to be greater than estimated, especially the grey area of steam consumption. The next phase will be to plan the identification of the grey area more accurately and perhaps to estimate the need for acquisitiion of new fixed meters for monitoring the energy consumption more reliably than at the present.

"Building Power out of Evidence is a collection of original papers written by international scholars, activists, and institution representatives who are leaders in their field; the collection offers a unique and detailed look at disability rights monitoring issues, law and policy reforms, best practices, holistic methods, and current discussions emerging from the field of disability rights monitoring. This text explores new research and policies from both a local and international perspective and furthers the discipline by discussing legislation, law, social policy and everyday experiences, with the need for the participation of people with disabilities in the process."--

The retention of a complete denture and the patient’s adaptation varies considerably among different individuals. Resorption of the edentulous alveolar ridge differs greatly and some patients need implant-retained overdentures to enable adequate retention of their prostheses. In some extreme cases it is necessary to increase the volume of the alveolar ridge with bone grafts. The aim of this study was to examine the outcome of implant-supported overdenture treatment conducted in Oulu University Hospital. The aim was also to assess the impact of treatment on oral health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction.The study group was comprised of patients treated with a mandibular or maxillary implant overdenture and a group of patients with extreme mandibular bone resorption treated with extraoral bone grafts and implants. The treatments were performed in 1985–2013 thus also providing long-term results.The results of this study showed predictable and successful treatment outcomes also among elderly patients and in severe situations with bone deficiency. The most frequent complication in the clinical follow-up was loosening of the retention mechanism, commonly noted in other previous studies. Despite some minor mechanical defects in prosthetic structures or mild mucosal inflammation around the implants, they did not hinder everyday use of the prostheses. Neither the number of supporting implants nor the connection type seemed to have a great impact on patient satisfaction. Older patients with a mandibular overdenture seemed to be most satisfied. In conclusion, treatment with implant overdentures seems to be successful also in the long-term.

All the five Nordic countries have a long tradition in health statistics and health monitoring. The cornerstone of the national health information systems is register information. There are, for example, complete population-based registration of births and deaths, cancers, hospital care, and medication (Cappelen and Lysol 2004, Gissler and Haukka. 2004, Mortensen 2004, Otterblad Olausson et al. 2004). The main prerequisites for a functioning register system are its completeness and high quality. These are facilitated by the Nordic legislation allowing mandatory reporting from public and private sector without informed consent and the existence of unique person identity number system. .
