The profession of violence : the rise and fall of the Kray twins
Night restaurants in Helsinki downtown area face fierce competition today. The number of various concepts is great and most operators compete for the attention and money of fairly same target market/ -s. Alongside traditional competitional tools such as quality and price new means need to be sought in order to stay in business, and more importantly, to be profitable. Relationship marketing offers one way of approaching this issue. It offers tools for studying all relationships a company has with its' environment, recognising the ones that are can be valuable and managing all these a successful entity.  In order to provide an extensive theoretical framework towards which the empirical part of the study about the use of relationship marketing can be reflected to, one has to study a number of issues. The theoretical part will begin with short introduction to socio-economic factors that affect the situation today. The issue of value creation is handled, both from the customer and the company point of view. Background and history of relationship marketing is studied and a number of marketing definitions and theories introduced. Furthermore the motivators behind consumer behaviour are discussed and concepts important to this subject explained. Finally all the issues above will be tied into logical entity in the chapter "relationship management and marketing strategy".  The empirical study was conducted as a qualitative study using half structured theme interviews. The interviewees all work in the chosen Helsinki night restaurants and are one way or another involved in the marketing planning and general management of these places. The beginning of empirical study shows the results of thirteen interviews. The later part of the chapter concentrates on the analysis that arise from the results and theory and on the recommendations based on the analysis.  In short the results show that all the restaurants in the study are familiar with the general concept of relationship marketing and practise a number of related activities such as VIP-card system and regular customer register. However it seems that strategic long term planning, clear goal setting for these actions and consistent follow up is often lacking. The importance of staff in using this approach was widely recognised but issues such as the necessity for clear separation between VIP-customers and masses divided opinions. Finally it seemed that all restaurants could name their chosen target segments but did not possess a lot data about them.

The Project-Based Thesis is aimed at writing a Business plan for a Bar and Nightclub called Kannelklubi.  The thesis was written in three parts. First, theoretical framework was gathered from various sources in order to understand how a successful, working Business Plan should be written. The elements of the Business Plan were studied in detail and used in the writing of actual business plan. Second part discussed the process of the business plan as well as the evaluation of the product. The third part is the actual business plan. The main idea to write the thesis was to prepare the writer for starting a business of his own. It was necessary to understand the various steps required to do so. The thesis was seen as a means to test the success of the business. In the beginning, the writer was not much concerned to attract financiers. Later, it was thought that this was a good opportunity to do so if other partners backed off from the project. The Business Plan was written, keeping in mind the real-life figures. The writer did succeed in writing a working Business Plan and realizing it with some modifications. Kannelklubi opened during the final stages of writing the Business Plan and is still in operation. In the thesis, Kannelklubi is evaluated to help new entrepreneurs understand the importance of a well drafted Business Plan.
