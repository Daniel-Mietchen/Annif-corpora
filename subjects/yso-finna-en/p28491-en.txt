European political parties
European politics : an introduction
Party patronage and party government in European democracies
"The emergence of Green parties throughout Europe during the 1980s marked the arrival of a new form of political movement, which challenged established models of party politics. However, since the 'Green wave' of the 1980s, these parties have struggled to solidify their electoral successes in the face of stern opposition and strategic political reaction from mainstream political parties." "The Evolution of Green Politics is the first study of the future direction of the European Green parties. It presents an in-depth, thematic and comparative approach to the analysis of recent Green party development, questioning whether the process of party evolution has resulted in the ideological dilution of Green ideals and objectives."--BOOK JACKET.

Governing Europe
The politics of coalition lies at the very heart of the political process in most European countries. Coalition can be analysed either theoretically or empirically; the aim of "Multiparty Government" is to reconcile these approaches. Students of European politics are given access to the insights of contemporary coalition theory while this theory is put in the context of the real world of coalition politics. The authors examine five basic themes: the identity and motivation of the actors in the coalition game; the eventual membership of the coalitions they form; their durability; the payoffs that are shared out by coalition members; and the impact of constitutional, behavioural and historical constraints on the process of coalition bargaining. They illustrate their discussion of theory with a range of detailed case studies. "Multiparty Government" offers an accessible approach that bridges the gap between the "European politics" and "game theory" traditions of political science and puts the systematic study of the politics of coalition on the broader political science map.

"Why do some Members of Parliament (MPs) take the parliamentary floor and speak more than others? Why do some MPs deviate more than others from the ideological position of their party? This book develops hypotheses on legislative speechmaking and evaluates them by analysing parliamentary debates in seven European democracies: Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. Assuming that MPs are concerned with policy-making, career advancement, and re-election, the authors discuss various incentives to taking the floor, and elaborate on the role of gender and psychological incentives in speechmaking. They test their expectations on a novel dataset that covers information on the number of speeches held by MPs and on the ideological positions MPs adopted when delivering a speech. "--
