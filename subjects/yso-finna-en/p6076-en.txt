AQUARIUM FISH
The purpose of this thesis was to establish a theoretical base of corporate social responsibility within business environment and study it in practical context with a case study approach. The aim was also to provide a developmental framework of corporate social responsibility for the target organisation.     The theoretical section covers a wide selection of the basic concepts within corporate social responsibility theory; main terms and definitions, aspects, relation to stakeholders, suggested reasoning and impacts and standards and measurement connected to it.     Target organisation of the case study was Merlin Entertainments Group and the Sea Life aquariums operated by it. Merlin is an international visitor attraction company that operates over 60 attractions in 13 countries. Sea Life aquariums are a large part of those attractions with 32 units in the world, 31 of them in Europe. The case study was conducted in 2009-2010 and included a variety of methods and materials; the organisation's internal and external materials, policies and other information, a survey to Sea Life managers and participant-observation.     Corporate social responsibility is a very current issue in the business and academic worlds alike. Although the issue as a whole is still much depated, and even without a clear, universally agreed definition, the interest and awareness are on the rise not only in the business and academic worlds but also amongst consumers and media. At its simplest, corporate social responsibility is about acknowledging and considering the impacts a business has on its environment and society and at least trying to minimise its negative impacts.     The case study revealed that Merlin Entertainment Group has taken a positive start on the corporate social responsibility issue on the group level with some established ground work on creating responsibility strategies and plans and cooperating with related organisations. However, on the unit level the issue is still rather unknown and responsibility issues have not been addressed yet although some form of responsible thinking can be seen in unit level actions on the practical level. Developing responsibility further will require top management commitment, efficient communication and resources.
