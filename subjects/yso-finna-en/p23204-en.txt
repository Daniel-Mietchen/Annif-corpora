In this book the author argues that post-crisis Wall Street continues to be controlled by large banks and explains how a small, diverse group of Wall Street men have banded together to reform the financial markets. A report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets, this book is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post-financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, they band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading, source of the most intractable problems, will have no advantage whatsoever. The characters are each completely different from what you think of when you think "Wall Street guy." Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world's stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits. The author shines a light into the darkest corners of the financial world, where anyone in contact with the market, even a retirement account, is part of the story. But in the end, this is the story of people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don't get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.

This thesis examines the Know Your Customer (KYC) – and Anti Money Laundering (AML) – aspects in the risk management policy used at the Trade Finance Finland (TFF) department at a large Nordic bank. The aim was to research on how the KYC and AML are affecting to TFF's actions, why is it important for both the bank and the customers to operate within the codes of conduct of the KYC and the AML, how the customers are seeing and experiencing the bank's KYC and AML regimes compared to the competitors and what kind of possibilities do the two offer on improving customer relations. The KYC and AML regimes affect clearly the TFF's daily work. They have helped to avoid all kinds of reputational risks and to maintain a trustworthy image in the market. The stricter requirements have brought the bank and the customers closer to one an-other: more information is being shared which can help on developing the product offerings and services. Improving the information flow between the customers and the bank is crucial: the bank should hand out more accurate information on its business policies to enhance the mutual understanding and customer satisfaction. There is a need for improvement both internally and externally: the personnel wished for clearer guidelines and better tools to perform the KYC and AML and the customers needed punctuality and speed in the handling times, the KYC and AML regimes have been too time consuming and caused delays in the customers' businesses.

Too big to fail
As incredible as it may seem in this hyper-connected, technologically advanced era, half the planet’s population exist as "Financial nomads"—those who nourish and shelter themselves without using traditional banking services. While the wealthy live at the top of a metaphorical pyramid, taking financial security and banking services for granted, there are billions of people who struggle at the pyramid's base in an exhausting state of financial exclusion and insecurity. Times are changing rapidly, but despite global uncertainty, technology has the capacity to reach and equip people in all walks of life. Advances in communications have reconfigured the ease with which we interact with our money—and these advances can provide innovative financial services to the unbanked and underserved around the world. Financial inclusion for all is indeed within our reach, and with this conviction, authors Karl Mehta and Carol Realini propose a vision for a better world and a blueprint to get there.
