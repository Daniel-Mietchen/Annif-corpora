Dissertation advisors play a significant role in the development of student theses and dissertations whether or not the dissertation is a qualitative or quantitative study. The methods used by the dissertation advisor contribute to the overall success of the student's progress while concurrently ensuring the quality is congruent with research expectations in a multidisciplinary environment. This case study provides insight into the plethora of challenges associated with the role of dissertation advisor, from the conceptualization of the researcher's dissertation prospectus, and its design, to the collection and analysis of data.

The grounded theory method is founded on a view of analysis whereby the research and potential hypotheses are not articulated at the outset; rather, the researcher initially seeks to gain familiarity with a research context, and only in later stages does the process become progressively more focused and targeted. As such, grounded theory method uses familiar research tools and techniques (coding, sampling, classification) but in new and novel ways. As a result, grounded theory method is one of the most widely used - if not the most widely used - method in current qualitative research. Initially aimed at the social sciences, grounded theory method has now spread so far that it can be found in almost any subject area or discipline in which people are observed or interviewed as participants. In Grounded Theory and Grounded Theorizing: Pragmatism in Research Practice, author Antony Bryant illustrates the key features of grounded theory method by showcasing examples from several of his most successful doctoral students. In this accessible volume, Bryant provides expert guidance on the use of grounded theory method in data collection by emphasizing the essential features of the method for readers and researchers of all training and backgrounds.

The collegial phenomenon : the social mechanisms of cooperation among peers in a corporate law partnership
This case study sheds light on two methodological challenges that arose during the course of a PhD project examining how parents of children with life-threatening allergies navigate and manage their child's diagnosis on a day-to-day basis. First, there were particular challenges working with an institutional review board to ensure that security and privacy issues were appropriately addressed for a study using electronic recruitment and data collection methods. Second was the ability to obtain detailed data with abstract concepts while using electronic data collection methods. Such challenges led to the consideration of the applicability and value of non-traditional methods for the completion of qualitative research.
Qualitative research in nursing and healthcare
Providing an introduction to situational analysis, Adele E. Clarke outlines how this method differs from and is superior to grounded theory and to qualitative data analysis.
In 2004, as a clinician recently turned academician, Laura Schmelzer realised she did not have the skills necessary to answer the complex questions that were arising. Specifically, she needed to better understand why and how mothers, who were trying to promote health, were adapting or failing to adapt to an environment that seems to promote sedentary activity and excess caloric intake. Consequently, she entered a PhD program. This case study traces the decisions she made as she constructed the research question and determined that the grounded theory approach would guide exploration. Additionally, it explores some of the challenges inherent within this approach and explains how the coding paradigm can be used to construct a proposition and substantive-level theory.

Sense of coherence (SOC) - typological examination with grounded theory approach.
This formative evaluation study of a professional development institute for K-12 educators examined immediate outcomes and short-term impacts on participants' learning and change in mathematics teaching practice. Participants' journals and interviews were analysed using qualitative methods and a grounded theory approach. Findings highlight the fact that while participants had previous knowledge and understanding of an inquiry approach to mathematics instruction, this knowledge was refined and reinforced through course participation.

Psychosocial work factors and burnout : a study of a working general population and patients at a stress rehabilitation clinic
The expression concatenated exploration refers at once to a longitudinal research process and the resulting set of field studies that are linked together in, as it were, a chain leading to cumulative, often formal, grounded theory. Concatenated exploratory research is rare in the social sciences (although least so in anthropology). The goal of this case is to describe the nature of this special kind of continuous research effort and illustrate its crucial role in the development of a formal grounded theory of serious leisure.
Action research and grounded theory : methods for understanding social responsibility in theory and practice
This practical book introduces the whole range of grounded theory approaches, providing a comprehensive description of the strategies and techniques employed in this methodology. Unlike most existing books in this area, it is not written from a particular philosophical standpoint, and is the ideal first introduction for any student or researcher looking to use grounded theory in their analysis for the first time. Birks and Mills' text is driven by practical case examples throughout to help the reader get to grips with the process of doing grounded theory analysis for themselves. The book deploys a variety of educational activities to guide readers through both the principles and the application of grounded theory, making this an ideal starter text for those new to the approach. This updated second edition: guides the reader through each step of the grounded theory process, clearly explains how to memo effectively, using examples, includes a chapter which explains the difference between data generation and collection, features information on how to use digital resources to manage data, discusses the philosophy and ethics of grounded theory within the qualitative paradigm.

Usability assessment of a UML-based formal modeling method using a cognitive dimensions framework
Grounded theory methodology allows researchers to generate theories that answer research questions that existing theories do not adequately explain. This methodology involves the use of the constant comparative method in an iterative cycle of data collection and analysis. To understand the data and make decisions that drive the cycle forward, the researcher may use diagrams and memos. This case describes the step-by-step use of diagrams in one grounded theory study that addresses the research question: 'How do administrators in high-poverty middle schools decide how to respond to students' challenging behaviors?'.

Recent surveys have shown that grounded theory is by far the most popular qualitative method across a range of disciplines. Edited by two of the foremost writers in the field, this book provides an overview of the field and brings together and represents all of the major standpoints within grounded theory.
Grounded theory 1984 - 1994 : volume one
This case study shares some of the methodological challenges faced during PhD research from 2007 to 2010. The study focused on Condition Management Programmes, part of the UK Government's Pathways to Work initiative, which provided work-focused interventions for people claiming health-related benefits. This case study provides a detailed account of some of the difficulties encountered in data analysis and how these were resolved. Five key areas of data analysis are addressed: getting conceptual, choosing a core category, recognising theoretical saturation, achieving theoretical integration and manual versus computer-assisted analysis.
'Grounded Theory' represents a primer for organisational, business and marketing students studying for research degrees who would like to adopt the grounded theory methodology approach for their dissertation or thesis.

Cultural diversity and trust in virtual teams : the role of cultural differences in trust development process
Research in the engineering field is often entrenched in the quantitative paradigm. Recent literature and studies have realised that not all research questions in engineering can be addressed through quantitative approaches. These areas include studies in engineering professional development, education and gender issues. This article describes one such study. The focus of this research was on the factors that impact the problem-solving ability of engineers. This case discussed how Grounded Theory was used, and the challenges faced and lessons learned from the use of qualitative method in a traditionally quantitative field are also considered.
