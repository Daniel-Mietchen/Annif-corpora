Aggressive behavior : current perspectives
Crimes of sexual nature perpetrated by adult females against males constitutes a serious problem in our society. A woman can rape a man, and this crime occurs far more often than most imagine. This book addresses an entire range of crimes beyond just rape, however; stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual assault, and sexual coercion are all covered in detail. The book illuminates the long-overlooked subject of adult female against adult male sex crimes. Combining personal accounts, information on criminal cases, relevant research on adult female against adult male sexual offenses, and statistical data from the FBI and other government sources, the authors comprehensively document how some women can be aggressive sexual predators, just like their male counterparts; highlight the changes in the criminal behavior of women; and provide fascinating stories of true crime as well as shocking revelations about human behavior.
Forensic psychotherapy : crime, psychodynamics and the offender patient
Aggression and destructiveness : psychoanalytic perspectives
Collective violence i.e., situations in which people are measurably harmed by the joint contributions of others has been a pervasive feature of human history. Nevertheless, as bloody as more distant human history has been, many scholars have concluded that the violence of past centuries pales before the violence and murderousness of the present one. This collection presents a range of theoretical and disciplinary approaches to the subject of collective violence. The distinguished contributors investigate the factors that contribute to the social context of violence, and examine the ways of thinking that allow participation in harmful activities. Cross-disciplinary in nature, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of sociology, psychology, ethics, criminology, and international affairs.

The 2nd edition of Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict provides timely and useful information about antagonism and reconciliation in all contexts of public and personal life. Building on the highly-regarded 1st edition (1999), and publishing at a time of seemingly inexorably increasing conflict and violent behaviour the world over, the Encyclopedia is an essential reference for students and scholars working in the field of peace and conflict resolution studies, and for those seeking to explore alternatives to violence and share visions and strategies for social justice and social change. Covering topics as diverse as Arms Control, Peace Movements, Child Abuse, Folklore, Terrorism and Political Assassinations, the Encyclopedia comprehensively addresses an extensive information area in 225 multi-disciplinary, cross-referenced and authoritatively authored articles. In his Preface to the 1st edition, Editor-in-Chief Lester Kurtz wrote: "The problem of violence poses such a monumental challenge at the end of the 20th century that it is surprising we have addressed it so inadequately. We have not made much progress in learning how to cooperate with one another more effectively or how to conduct our conflicts more peacefully. Instead, we have increased the lethality of our combat through revolutions in weapons technology and military training. The Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict is designed to help us to take stock of our knowledge concerning these crucial phenomena." Ten years on, the need for an authoritative and cross-disciplinary approach to the great issues of violence and peace seems greater than ever.

Hostility and aggression towards marginalized groups have taken a new form—microaggressions. Microaggressions are often unconsciously delivered as subtle snubs or dismissive looks, gestures, and tones. This edited book discusses the manifestation, psychological dynamics, and impact of microaggressions on not only the well–being of marginalized groups, but on their role in creating disparities in education, employment, and health care. Covering every major racial/ethnic group as well as gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, and class, students and mental health researchers will benefit from this book's cutting–edge contributions.
