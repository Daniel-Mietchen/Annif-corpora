This book presents topics on the basics of materials selection and design which will give a better understanding on the selection methods and then find suitable materials for the applications. This book draws the simple and straightforward quantitative methods followed by knowledge-based expert system approach with real and tangible case studies to show how undergraduate or post-graduate students or engineers can apply their knowledge on materials selection and design. Topics discussed in this book contain special features such as illustration, tables, and tutorial questions for easy understanding. A few published books or documents are available, hence this book will be very useful for those who use (or want to use) materials selection approach without the advantages of having had comprehensive knowledge or expertise in this materials' world.

The self-assembled nanostructured materials described in this book offer a number of advantages over conventional material technologies in a wide range of sectors. World leaders in the field of self-organisation of nanostructures review the current status of research and development in the field, and give an account of the formation, properties, and self-organisation of semiconductor nanostructures. Chapters on structural, electronic and optical properties, and devices based on self-organised nanostructures are also included. Future research work on self-assembled nanostructures will connect diverse areas of material science, physics, chemistry, electronics and optoelectronics. This book will provide an excellent starting point for workers entering the field and a useful reference to the nanostructured materials research community. It will be useful to any scientist who is involved in nanotechnology and those wishing to gain a view of what is possible with modern fabrication technology. Mohamed Henini is a Professor of Applied Physics at the University of Nottingham. He has authored and co-authored over 750 papers in international journals and conference proceedings and is the founder of two international conferences. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Microelectronics Journal and has edited three previous Elsevier books. Key Features: - Contributors are world leaders in the field - Brings together all the factors which are essential in self-organisation of quantum nanostructures - Reviews the current status of research and development in self-organised nanostructured materials - Provides a ready source of information on a wide range of topics - Useful to any scientist who is involved in nanotechnology - Excellent starting point for workers entering the field - Serves as an excellent reference manual.

Materials for design
Synopsis: The new edition of DeGarmo's Materials and Processes in Manufacturing focuses on updates and more coverage of non-metallic materials, sustainability, lean manufacturing, rapid prototyping and revised end of chapter and case study content. It emphasizes application and design, present mathematical models and analytic equations sparingly and uses case studies to highlight real world examples of manufacturing. Other revisions and updates include the addition of frontend Learning Objectives; elimination of weak problems and addition of new problems; more relevant and current case studies as well as additional new ones where appropriate; new chapter on Rapid Prototyping; expanded coverage of non-metallic materials such as composites, polymers, etc. ; a discussion about sustainability and green, and engineering and how it relates to manufacturing; coverage of lean manufacturing and production; and updated references and chapter summaries.
