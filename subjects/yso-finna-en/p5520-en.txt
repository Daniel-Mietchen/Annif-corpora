Temporal data mining deals with the harvesting of useful information from temporal data. New initiatives in health care and business organizations have increased the importance of temporal information in data today. From basic data mining concepts to state-of-the-art advances, Temporal Data Mining covers the theory of this subject as well as its application in a variety of fields. It discusses the incorporation of temporality in databases as well as temporal data representation, similarity computation, data classification, clustering, pattern discovery, and prediction. The book also explores the use of temporal data mining in medicine and biomedical informatics, business and industrial applications, web usage mining, and spatiotemporal data mining. Along with various state-of-the-art algorithms, each chapter includes detailed references and short descriptions of relevant algorithms and techniques described in other references. In the appendices, the author explains how data mining fits the overall goal of an organization and how these data can be interpreted for the purpose of characterizing a population. She also provides programs written in the Java language that implement some of the algorithms presented in the first chapter.

Social network analysis increasingly bridges the discovery of patterns in diverse areas of study as more data becomes available and complex. Yet the construction of huge networks from large data often requires entirely different approaches for analysis including; graph theory, statistics, machine learning and data mining. This work covers frontier studies on social network analysis and mining from different perspectives such as social network sites, financial data, e-mails, forums, academic research funds, XML technology, blog content, community detection and clique finding, prediction of user's- behavior, privacy in social network analysis, mobility from spatio-temporal point of view, agent technology and political parties in parliament. These topics will be of interest to researchers and practitioners from different disciplines including, but not limited to, social sciences and engineering.

Yhteenveto (Finnish summary).
"Bridging the gap between the marketer who must put text analytics to use and the increasingly rarefied community of data analysis experts, Practical Text Analytics is an accessible guide to the many remarkable advances in text analytics that specialists are discussing among themselves. Instead of being a resource for programmers, a book on theory or an introduction on how to use advanced statistical programs, this daily reference resource cuts through the profusion of jargon, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various methods and serving as a guide to what is credible in this fast-moving and often confusing field. Practical Text Analytics provides guidance on the application of text analytics for marketing professionals who must interpret the results and apply them in their campaigns. It presents the process of analysis in ways that people who use the data need to see them, helping marketers to clarify and organize confidently the confusing array of methods, frame the right questions and apply the results successfully to find meaning in any unstructured data and develop powerful new marketing strategies. About the series: The Marketing Science series makes difficult topics accessible to marketing students and practitioners by grounding them in business reality. Each book is written by an expert in the field and includes case studies and illustrations so marketers can gain confidence in applying the tools and techniques and commission external research"--

The quality of students' learning experiences is a critical concern for all higher education institutions. With the assistance of modern technological advances, educational establishments have the capability to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of their learning programs. Developing Effective Educational Experiences through Learning Analytics is a pivotal reference source that focuses on the adoption of data mining and analysis techniques in academic institutions, examining how this collected information is utilized to improve the outcome of student learning. Highlighting the relevance of data analytics to current educational practices, this book is ideally designed for researchers, practitioners, and professionals actively involved in higher education settings.
The goal of this book is to present a variety of methods used in multidimensional data visualization. The emphasis is placed on new research results and trends in this field, including optimization, artificial neural networks, combinations of algorithms, parallel computing, different proximity measures, nonlinear manifold learning, and more. Many of the applications presented allow us to discover the obvious advantages of visual data mining—it is much easier for a decision maker to detect or extract useful information from graphical representation of data than from raw numbers. The fundamental idea of visualization is to provide data in some visual form that lets humans understand them, gain insight into the data, draw conclusions, and directly influence the process of decision making. Visual data mining is a field where human participation is integrated in the data analysis process; it covers data visualization and graphical presentation of information.
