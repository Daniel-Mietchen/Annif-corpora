Transplant patients undergoing nontransplant surgeries are increasingly common. In Finland, an anaesthesia nurse is responsible for the planning, preparation and monitoring of anaesthesia during surgery together with the anaesthetist. The purpose of the thesis was to examine the special considerations and recommendations in anaesthesia nursing of a kidney transplant patient. The thesis focused on the perioperative care of a kidney transplant patient, and a Finnish anaesthesia nurse's role in implementing it. The objective was to increase nurses' and nursing students' knowledge on kidney transplant patients' anaesthesia considerations.  Information was gathered by conducting a literature review. The core themes, kidney transplant patients and anaesthesia nursing, formed the basis for the literature search. Ten articles from reliable sources were selected and critically analysed. The results describe the advisable nursing interventions considering a kidney transplant patient's anaesthesia during surgery.  The results indicate that preparing a kidney transplant patient's anaesthesia requires careful consideration. A kidney transplant and the end-stage renal disease leading to it affect many aspects of perioperative care, such as medication, fluid therapy and the surgical position. Thus it is essential to comprehend a kidney transplant's effects on the patient and their anaesthesia. Further studies on different transplant patients' anaesthesia nursing would be beneficial in order to increase the safety of all transplant patients.

Heart volume in human kidney transplantation
A shocking tour through a macabre global underworld where organs, bones, and live people are bought and sold on the red market. Investigative journalist Scott Carney has spent five years tracing the lucrative and deeply secretive trade in human bodies and body parts. The Red Market reveals the rise, fall, and resurgence of this multibillion-dollar underground trade through history, from early medical study and modern universities to poverty-ravaged Eurasian villages and high-tech Western labs; from body snatchers and surrogate mothers to skeleton dealers and the poor who sell body parts to survive. While local and international law enforcement have cracked down on the market, advances in science have increased the demand for human tissue--ligaments, kidneys, even rented space in women's wombs--leaving little room to consider the ethical dilemmas inherent in the flesh-and-blood trade.--From publisher description.

Early one blustery day near Le Havre, three teenagers head down to the sea together to go surfing. They are old friends: Chris, Johan and Simon. Exhausted after just one hour in the rough waves, they begin their drive back to town, but Chris, the driver, falls asleep at the wheel and the car skids off the road. Whilst Chris and Johan escape with a few broken bones, it soon becomes clear that Simon is beyond resuscitation, brain-dead in a deep coma. Apart from his brain however, Simon's organs are in perfect condition. His devastated parents face an agonising decision. If his life support is switched off straight away, his organs can still be used to save other lives, but by consenting, his parents will be choosing to end what remains of their son's life. They decide to go ahead: Simon's heart, lungs, liver and kidneys can be removed and used in organ transplants. And with that decision, their son's life ends and the implacable mechanisms of organ donation and transplantation click into gear. Simon's heart is removed and a match is found in Paris: Claire Mejan, who suffers from myocarditis and can only hope for survival if she receives a heart transplant. She has just a few hours notice before her transplant will take place. In the space of just twenty-four hours, Simon Limbres will have said goodbye to his girlfriend, gone surfing with his two best friends, lost his life in a horrific accident, had all his organs removed and shipped around France to waiting matches, and, as his doctor cleans and stitches his empty shell of a body, his heart will begin to beat again many miles away, inside Claire Mejan's body.
