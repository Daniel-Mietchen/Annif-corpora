These conditions put pressure for the business managers as they should set goals for improving customer experience. Measuring without any goal is just a waste of resources. Theoretical background was gathered during the autumn 2015, as customer experience is widely researched topic, the problem was to choose the most beneficial data. The empirical part of this study was conducted by using different qualitative methods, such as theme interviews conducted for the customers and for the employees of the case company. In addition, NPS survey conducted by a third party was included in the research process. The collected data was analyzed and compared with the findings from the theory. Different research methods gave an opportunity for finding relevant data and also a chance to see the reasons behind different factors and results. Due to confidential data, results from the NPS questionnaire are marked as confidential.

Current consumption is an important part of mobile devices. Products with reduced current consumption can be made much more appealing to customers. The goal of this thesis was to make an automated current measurement system using the LabVIEW program. The thesis was commissioned by ST-Ericsson Ltd. This thesis is designed to give background information about cellular network standards, radio frequency and current measurements, measurement instruments and the LabVIEW program. The main focus is on how the measurement software was made. The measurement system is intended to make current measurements faster and more accurate by automating the process. Earlier all the current measurements were carried out manually, which was very slow and open to human errors. The creation of the system began by installing LabVIEW and by collecting the necessary measurement equipment. The software progressed in sections and a different program was created for each of the cellular standards. These programs were tested before moving on to the next standard. Finally all the different standards were combined to a single program. The result was a working current measurement system, which was immediately brought into use. The system made it possible to run measurements during nights or weekends, which produces lots of data with stable results. This data can be analyzed and utilized in developing new hardware and software. The system can be expanded in the future by adding different measurement instruments. This would enable replacing some equipment if a certain instrument is occupied. It is also possible to add a temperature chamber to control the temperature of the device under testing. The software can be updated by adding more cellular network standards or radio frequency measurements. The software can also be merged with other measurement software.
The objective of this Bachelor’s thesis was to automate performance measurements done in the development of a radio transmitter and a receiver. The main objective was to develop measurement automation routines for five basic performance measurements using National Instruments LabVIEW as a software development environment. In order to meet this objective, a study of radio technology and their architecture was required. Additionally, a study of measurement systems and control was required. The developed software had to be modular to ease further development in future. The thesis was done for OY LM Ericsson AB site in Oulu, which is concentrated on the development of small-cell base station products. Measurement results gained with automation software were compared to those of manual measurements. As a result, main five measurements were successfully automated, and the results obtained matched those of manual measurements in terms of accuracy. Also, multiple smaller measurement automation routines were developed to ease automation development in the future. The thesis work was evaluated successful because of time and resources saved by the automation. In addition, it was possible to use the software modules in different additional measurements, for example in the testing of signal processing algorithms.

Improving purchasing performance measurement : an action research in a Finnish multinational's Russian business unit
Today, competitive advantage cannot be gained through improving the products or lowering the prices. Advantage over the competitors must be searched from new sources, for example by focusing on customer experience. In addition the value created in the past, can be important when the customer is making the purchasing decision in the future. The changes in the consumer's wants and needs are driving companies to make changes in their business strategy. Concept of customer experience refers to finding out the needs of the customer; in order to gain competitive advantage. In addition, focusing on negative impressions is important, as people tend to share their experiences to their friends and family  this makes customer experience a marketing tool. Focusing on different aspects of customer experience is important, as customers should be the core of the business  without the customers there is no need for the company. Companies should focus on developing customer experience in order to make the customer do transactions in the future as well. The topic for this bachelor's thesis was given by the case company; Limingan Osuuspankki. During my internship, the case company wanted to conduct a research focusing on customer experience as the case company wanted to focus on develop in creating experiences for the customers. As the case company had no previous experience on the topic, the goal of this research was to find out what kind of customer experience does the customers of the case company have and to find suggestions for developing it. This study focused on different aspects of customer experience, for example - how it is created and how it can be measured. All in all, developing customer experience is dependent on many different factors. Different tools for measuring customer experience, give only one viewpoint into phenomena. ^

The topic of this thesis was offered by Mypose Oy, a startup company based in Oulu, Finland. Their primary products are impressive photo machines, which can be utilized by businesses to transform customers into brand ambassadors in social media. As the company has been expanding its business, there was a requirement to improve their analytics system, so that statistical insights of marketing campaigns using Mypose machines would be delivered to customer quickly and punctually. The thesis was divided into two distinct parts, in which the first one focused on the fundamental concepts of social media and social marketing, as well as the methods to identify, collect and aggregate metrics on social networks in order to calculate useful key performance indicators (KPIs). It also included studies about the values of email in modern marketing strategies, and methods to measure email effectiveness. The second part involved designing a new analytics system. It included examining different flows of Mypose photos to identify possible metrics, and determining proper methods to collect and compute KPIs based on accumulated statistical values. Additionally, a brief database modification and user interface designs for the new system were also discussed. The final result was the prototype of a new analytics system that was rich of functionalities, comprehensively visualized and easy to extend. Various parts of the outcome were developed and functioned in production during the course of writing this thesis. It also exposed some concerns about further development of the system.

Assessment of skin physiology is moving rapidly away from a purely descriptive approach as we gain a deeper understanding of biophysical and biochemical processes in the stratum corneum, such as those relating to its barrier function and hydration. As a result of research utilizing bioengineering methods, reliable and reproducible approaches are now available for product testing in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as well as in basic research. This book examines in detail all aspects of cosmetic testing -- legal, general, and practical. After discussion of regulatory and ethical issues and guidelines, essential guidance is provided on the planning, performance, and evaluation of scientific studies in skin physiology. The topics addressed range from laboratory and staffing requirements through to testing devices and methods, factors influencing measurements, and study design. In addition, detailed information is provided on test settings for a range of cosmetic products. All of the authors are recognized experts in their field. This book will be invaluable to researchers, students, and medical staff in explaining how best to assess skin functions in controlled studies using non-invasive biophysical instruments.
