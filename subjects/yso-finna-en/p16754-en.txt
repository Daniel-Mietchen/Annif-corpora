(Publisher-supplied data) Human Drug Metabolism, An Introduction, Second Edition provides an accessible introduction to the subject and will be particularly invaluable to those who already have some understanding of the life sciences. Completely revised and updated throughout, the new edition focuses only on essential chemical detail and includes patient case histories to illustrate the clinical consequences of changes in drug metabolism and its impact on patient welfare. After underlining the relationship between efficacy, toxicity and drug concentration, the book then considers how metabolizing systems operate and how they impact upon drug concentration, both under drug pressure and during inhibition. Factors affecting drug metabolism, such as genetic polymorphisms, age and diet are discussed and how metabolism can lead to toxicity is explained. The book concludes with the role of drug metabolism in the commercial development of therapeutic agents as well as the pharmacology of some illicit drugs.

The rapidly expanding field of food safety includes many new developments in the understanding of the entire range of toxic compounds found in foods - whether naturally occurring or having been introduced by industry or food processing methods. This second edition of "Introduction to Food Toxicology" explores these developments while continuing to provide a core understanding of the basic principles of food toxicology. "Introduction to Food Toxicology, Second Edition" includes new and updated coverage of key topics including the circulatory systems and their influence on toxicity, molecular mechanisms of absorption and excretion, the multiplicity and specificity of phase I and II reactions, toxins from marine food sources including the growing number of toxins from symbiotic bacteria, algae and plankton, focus on the occurrence and modes of action of the central mycotoxins and information on emerging problems, including fumonisins, regulations, including the Food Quality Control Act, solid-pfase extraction, immuno assay, and LC/MS, mechanisms of regulation of xenobiotic activation and deactivation. It also includes developments in the modes of action and impact of natural toxins in food plants, a comprehensive review of the issues surrounding dioxins, the function of antioxidants and their toxicological aspects, acrylamide, its occurrence, toxicity and regulation on its use, phytochemicals, their beneficial effects and the modes of action of this growing group of nutraceuticals from food plants and diet and drug interactions.
