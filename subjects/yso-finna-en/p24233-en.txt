humus lakes
The lake functioning has been an interesting subject for limnologist and more importantly, the sustainability of humic lakes. The major challenge has always been in sampling the anaerobic bacteria form hypolimnion without the contamination of samples by light and oxygen. This study focused on developing and testing one method and yielded a result without the samples being contaminated.  The sampling method consisted of syringe and tube that was wrapped with tape (3 folds) to cut any light contamination to the samples while pulling them. The incubation vials were vacuumed to negative pressure to make sure no contamination of samples with the oxygen.  To further mimic the natural environment, the vials were wrapped in black painted water soluble paper to reduce the effect of light while filling those vials; and would dissolve in water in no time so that the natural light condition could be attained at those respective depths of sampling. Since the method fulfilled most of its required categories, better results were obtained with a clear difference in light and dark production.
