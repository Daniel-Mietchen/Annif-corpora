Festival and special event management
The automotive industry and its supply chain has historically been a pioneer. However, in its second century the car industry is lagging behind in supply chain management and is not able to streamline the production volume to meet demand. The automotive industry is estimated to have 20% of overcapacity worldwide. The automotive supply chain and the production methods have not changed much since Henry Ford's Model T over a century ago. Customer oriented Build to Order approach has been identified to be the opposite to current Build to Stock, but adapting new approach in complex and conventional supply chain is easier said than done. Hence the study compares the two major logistic and production approaches used in automotive industry, build to order and build to stock. The study has been conducted as a desktop study, benefitting from the author's personal experience and interest in the field. The aim of the thesis is to find the reasoning behind the hardly proceeding shift from build to stock to build to order. The study also suggests improvements to automotive supply chain even if it was to stay as build to stock. It is suggested in the thesis that an even bigger obstacle than investments in new machinery, technology in the factory and lack of knowledge, is the mindset in the industry. Things have been done the way they have been for a century, and it is difficult to convince the industry that not only a change, but many changes are needed to achieve flexibility in all the aspects.

This market research was conducted on a request of the logistics software specialist Soloplan GmbH to discover business opportunities in the Finnish Transport Management System (TMS) producer market. The basis for the research lies in numerous theories which suggest certain key factors to be examined to better predict success or failure for a company in a target market. These essential factors were said to be the macro environment, the market size and trend, the competitive setting on the market and most importantly the features of the customers. The goal was to acquire enough information about all of these to be able to analyze whether it could be recommended for Soloplan GmbH to establish business operations in Finland. The research proved Finland being attractive due to its supportive macro environment, the high importance of transportations sector to the country in general and the large number of potential customers i.e. the road haulage companies. A survey was conducted to estimate the demand and to learn more about the potential customers. The results showed that the usage of TMS is not widespread, but the interest in it exists. However, the survey also indicated that the target market is segmented and dominated by smaller transporters with less need for such management tool and high price-sensitivity. Also the competition in the market was found to be quite intensive. It was concluded that successful market entry for Soloplan GmbH would require product customization for the local needs and it is not recommended alone for the small Finnish market.
