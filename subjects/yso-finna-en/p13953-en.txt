Based on a thiry million word corpus of Arabic which includes both written and spoken material, this dictionary provides detailed information for each of the 5000 entries, including the English equivalent, a sample sentence, and an indication of major register variation (including regional and dialectal). Pronunciation indicators will be given in the form of diacritics for MSA words and Romanized pronunciation for colloquial terms. Users can access the top 5000 words either through the main frequency listing or through an alphabetical index (arranged by Arabic root). Throughout the frequency listing there will also be thirty thematically-organized 'boxed' lists of the top words from a variety of key topics such as sports, weather, clothing, relations etc
