Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the world. The outcome of patients at a very high operative risk undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery has not been thoroughly investigated.Cohorts of patients underwent coronary surgery between January 1997 and December 2013 at the Oulu University Hospital, Finland. Data was acquired from electronic patient records. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected data to evaluate outcome and identify predictors of adverse events.Very high-risk patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass surgery had a high 30-day mortality (16.2%), but their 5-year survival was satisfactory (66.8%).Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were compared to a control group. Immediate postoperative mortality was slightly higher in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients (6.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.24), but the overall 5-year survival rates were similar (80.7% vs. 84.5%).Patients with preoperative stage 3 chronic kidney disease have a higher mortality than patients with stage 1-2 chronic kidney disease. Kidney function decline/year was predictive of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and also tended to predict fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.The E-CABG postoperative complication grading system was used to stratify the severity and prognostic impact of postoperative complications and was shown to predict early and late mortality for these patients.The outcome of emergency coronary artery bypass surgery was studied in a multi-center setting. Increasing emergency classes, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%, on-pump surgery, and participating centers were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 86.4%, 81.6%, and 76.1%.Despite the high preoperative risk of these patients, the long-term outcome for coronary surgery is satisfactory. Patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease may experience a significant decline in kidney function and poor outcome. Early referral to a nephrologist may be beneficial for these patients. The E-CABG complication grading system seems to be a promising tool for stratifying the severity and prognostic impact of complications occurring after coronary surgery.
