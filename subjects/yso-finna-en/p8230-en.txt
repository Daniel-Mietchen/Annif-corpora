The art of enhanced photography : beyond the photographic image
Miniooppera Avantgarden kaiho = Mini opera Nostalgia for Avant-garde
"Born in Berlin in 1891, John Heartfield, along with George Grosz, is widely considered to have invented photomontage, a technique of cutting up and manipulating photographs. During the 1930s Heartfield produced some of the most visually arresting and politically hard-hitting artwork of the twentieth century, appropriating the widely circulated propaganda of the time to create a biting critique of contemporary politics. This lavishly illustrated, large-format survey of his work, the most authoritative yet published, draws on the superlative collections of the Academie der Kunst, Berlin, and the David King collection at Tate Modern. Including more than 150 full-colour reproductions of Heartfield's powerful work, both in its original and printed forms, as well as documentary photographs and recollections from Heartfield's surviving family members, the book features a lively introduction by David King, as well as illuminating short texts on many of the works. Heartfield's astonishing visual broadsides, aimed at the abuse and misuse of power, and part of his lifelong wish to create a fairer and more peaceful world, are every bit as relevant and cutting-edge today as when they were first published."--Publisher's description.

The cinema of Eisenstein
The art and craft of montage
Beginning around 1910, vanguard artists demanded that true art go beyond the intellectual and transform daily life. This title highlights the work of six influential European artists who took this idea into the wider world, where it merged enthusiastically with demands in the industrial marketplace, nascent mass media, and urban popular culture.

The Soviet photograph, 1924-1937
Initially conceived as a personal project on the walls of Sorrenti's New York loft, the material in 'Draw Blood for Proof' eventually found its way onto gallery walls as a large-scale installation piece in 2004. Papering the site from floor to ceiling with layers of collected snapshots, contact sheets, prints, Polaroids and ephemera drawn from over fifteen years of work, Sorrenti's collection was a unique look into the artist's diaristic creative process, going beyond ideas of public and private production. Re-photographed as a series of 8x10 Polaroids and reconstituted here, Sorrenti's montage finds yet another incarnation in book form. Here the images are both documentation and personal exploration, and the layout repositions Sorrenti's photographs in a series faithful to their placement on the walls of the gallery. This gives the viewer a sense of the ra impact of the original installation but also creates new visual relationships between images as they move across spreads, redefining themselves and one another on the pages.
