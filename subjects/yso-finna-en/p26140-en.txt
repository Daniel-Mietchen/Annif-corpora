Climate change law and policy in Norway
Climate Change Law, the first volume of the Elgar Encyclopedia of Environmental Law, provides a guide to the rapidly evolving body of legal scholarship relating to climate change. It is designed to focus on the underlying concepts that are of concern to researchers, students and policymakers rather than on the details of national legislation. The core topics include the difficulty of setting up a coherent international treaty approach, the importance of national and subnational legal action, the potential role of international and national courts, and the importance of human rights and environmental justice. Providing a comprehensive discussion, more than 50 entries developed by experts from across the world cover mitigation and adaptation issues in their wider context, from both international and national perspectives. Each chapter concludes by identifying important research challenges. Finally, the concluding chapter argues that a discernible global legal regime is emerging. The 2015 Paris Agreement marks both the increasingly interlinked but polycentric nature of this new regime. This is the definitive resource for all those seeking the state of the art of climate change law, from students and legal scholars to practising lawyers, civil servants and NGOs.

Climate change and the law
Publisher's description: This timely Research Handbook discusses the challenges brought about by the need to adapt to a changing climate. It considers how adaptation is necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming of the Earth's atmosphere which is already unavoidable due to past emissions. With adaptation policies around the world still in their infancy, the book examines the legal challenges and barriers to climate change adaptation and how can they be overcome. It brings together expert contributors to consider topics ranging across tort and insurance law, disaster law, water law, marine law, planning law, biodiversity law, green buildings, pollution control, displacement, agriculture and energy. With its transnational and multilevel approach, the Research Handbook on Climate Change Adaptation Law will be an essential resource for academics in the field of climate change policy and law, policymakers and other government officials working on climate change, and NGOs working in the field of climate change.

Climate change and human rights
The first edition of Anthropology and Climate Change pioneered the study of climate change through the lens of anthropology, covering the relation between human cultures and the environment from prehistoric times to the present. This second, heavily revised edition brings the material on this rapidly changing field completely up to date, with major scholars from around the world mapping out trajectories of research and issuing specific calls for action. The new edition introduces new "foundational" chapters--laying out what anthropologists know about climate change today, new theoretical and practical perspectives, insights gleaned from sociology, and international efforts to study and curb climate change--making the volume a perfect introductory textbook; presents a series of case studies--both new case studies and old ones updated and viewed with fresh eyes--with the specific purpose of assessing climate trends; provides a close look at how climate change is affecting livelihoods, especially in the context of economic globalization and the migration of youth from rural to urban areas; expands coverage to England, the Amazon, the Marshall Islands, Tanzania, and Ethiopia; re-examines the conclusions and recommendations of the first volume, refining our knowledge of what we do and do not know about climate change and what we can do to adapt.
