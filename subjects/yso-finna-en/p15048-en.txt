The aim of this work was to assess trends in childhood mortality in Finland over the period 1969-2004 and to identify the main preventable causes of death in childhood. Specific topics of interest were childhood mortality due to infectious diseases and possible regional differences in childhood mortality. As accidents are the most common cause of death in childhood, we also analysed regional differences in accidental mortality in childhood between the years 1969 and 2013. Annual neonatal mortality declined by 78%, from 11.13/1000 in 1969 to 2.46/1000 in 2004, with perinatal disorders and congenital malformations the most common causes of death, while childhood mortality declined by 65% during the same period, from 0.67/1000 to 0.23/1000, with accidents the leading cause of death, followed by congenital malformations, tumours and haematological diseases, and infectious diseases. Childhood mortality due to infectious diseases decreased by 89%, from 0.12/1000 in 1969 to 0.013/1000 in 2004, and neonatal mortality from similar causes by 69%, from 0.50/1000 to 0.16/1000. Pneumonia, central nervous system infections and septicaemia were the most significant fatal infections in childhood. There were no significant differences in childhood mortality between the university hospital districts, but notable differences existed at the regional level between the central hospital districts. There were also considerable regional differences in childhood accidental mortality, which showed a tendency to persist with time, especially in the case of traffic accidents, suicides and homicides. Childhood mortality in Finland has declined markedly, and the trend was a continuous one throughout the period concerned. The differences between the central hospital districts, however, suggest that paediatric care in Finland may need further centralization. Accidents represent the main preventable cause of death in childhood, and further reductions in mortality could be achieved, especially through local preventive measures.

Illness in childhood was common in early modern England. Hannah Newton asks how sick children were perceived and treated by doctors and laypeople, examines the family's experience, and takes the original perspective of sick children themselves. She provides rare and intimate insights into the experiences of sickness, pain, and death.

All too often, childbirth in early modern England was associated with fear, suffering and death, and this melancholy preoccupation weighed heavily on the seventeenth-century mind. This landmark study examines John Milton's life and work, uncovering evidence of the poet's engagement with maternal mortality and the dilemmas it presented. Drawing on both literary scholarship and up-to-date historical research, Louis Schwartz provides important new readings of Milton's poetry, including Paradise Lost, as well as a wide-ranging survey of the medical practices and religious beliefs that surrounded the perils of childbirth. The reader is granted a richer understanding of how seventeenth-century society struggled to come to terms with its fears, and how one of its most important poets gave voice to that struggle.
