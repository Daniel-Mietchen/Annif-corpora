"European Cinema and Intertextuality offers an original and up-to-date approach to the representation of history through film. It provides an interpretation of a number of feature films representing crucial events and personalities from European history in the twentieth century. This includes the Second World War, Armenian Genocide, anti-Semitic attacks in Poland after the Second World War, European terrorism of the 1970s, and the end of communism. Films discussed include loge de l'amour and Passion by Jean-Luc Godard, Ararat by Atom Egoyan, The Baader Meinhof Complex by Uli Edel, Moonlighting by Jerzy Skolimowski, 12:08 East of Bucharest by Corneliu Porumboiu and Kawasaki Rose by Jan Hrebejk"--Provided by publisher.
Cinema and Agamben brings together a group of established scholars of film and visual culture to explore the nexus between the moving image and the influential work of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Including two original texts by Agamben himself, published here for the first time in English translation, these essays facilitate a unique multidisciplinary conversation that fundamentally rethinks the theory and praxis of cinema. In their resourceful analyses of the work of artists such as David Claerbout, Jean-Luc Godard, Philippe Grandrieux, Michael Haneke, Jean Rouch, and others, the authors put to use a range of key concepts from Agamben's rich body of work, like biopolitics, de-creation, gesture, potentiality and profanation. Sustaining the eminently interdisciplinary scope of Agamben's writing, the essays all bespeak the importance of Agamben's thought for forging new beginnings in film theory and for remedying the elegiac proclamations of the death of cinema so characteristic of the current moment.

The interview
A comprehensive history of how the conflicts and balances of power in the Maoist revolutionary campaigns from 1951 to 1979 complicated and diversified the meanings of films, this book offers a discursive study of the development of early PRC cinema. Wang closely investigates how film artists, Communist Party authorities, cultural bureaucrats, critics, and audiences negotiated, competed, and struggled with each other for the power to decide how to use films and how their extensively different, agonistic, and antagonistic power strategies created an ever-changing discursive network of meaning in cinema.
