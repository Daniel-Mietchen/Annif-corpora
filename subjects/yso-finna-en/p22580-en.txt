The aim of this Bachelor’s thesis was to design and develop a search engine for websites. The topic of the thesis was chosen after consultations with several teachers. One unique aspect of developing a search engine is that it covers a large amount of theoretical and practical aspects of Computer Science and Information Technology, so doing the project was a good practice of combining the knowledge and experience to learn new topics and preparing for future challenging projects. The last version of the application does successfully its job with an acceptable accuracy. Since the code is well-organized and extensible, potentially it is possible to develop the application in the feature to support more features and enhance the current ones. The application is also customizable both in front and back-end. Thus, developers who are interested in such projects could benefit from the code.

"Expert F# 2.0 is about practical programming in a beautiful language that puts the power and elegance of functional programming into the hands of professional developers. In combination with .NET, F# achieves unrivaled levels of programmer productivity and program clarity. F# isn't just another functional programming language. It's a general-purpose language ideal for real-world development. F# seamlessly integrates functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles so you can flexibly and elegantly solve any programming problem. Whatever your background, you'll find that F# is easy to learn, fun to use, and extraordinarily powerful. F# will change the way you think about--and go about--programming"--Resource description p.
