dyspraxia
Many people with dyspraxia and dyslexia also have ADHD. This fully revised edition of David Grant's thought-provoking, insightful book develops our understanding of specific learning differences and considers the further challenges presented by these overlapping conditions. New sections explore mental imagery [visualisation] and synaesthesia, enabling the reader to gain a fuller understanding of the sensory experiences and thoughts of individuals with specific learning differences. As well as providing information defining Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and ADHD, "That's the Way I Think" addresses topics including: colours and reading; becoming creative; sports, genes and evolution; and, 'invisible' girls and women. The accessible style of this book, which includes numerous anecdotes and personal insights, will immediately strike a chord with anyone who has first- or second-hand experience of these specific learning differences. Essential and enlightening reading for people with specific learning differences as well as their parents and/or partner, this book also provides an invaluable insight for teachers, teaching assistants and SENCos.
