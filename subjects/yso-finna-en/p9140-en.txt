"Supply Chain Strategy" is today's most comprehensive resource for up-to-the-minute thinking and practices on developing supply chain strategies that support a company's overall objectives.Covering world-class practices and systems, taken from the files of Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, General Electric, and other companies, it covers essential supply chain subjects including: logistics data mining - for identifying the root cause of material and information flow problems, pinpointing opportunities for process improvements, and providing an objective basis for project-team decision making; and, inventory planning and management - presenting metrics, processes, and systems for forecasting, demand planning, and inventory control, yielding lower inventory levels and improved customer service. It also covers: logistics information systems and Web-based logistics - helping to substitute information for inventory and work content; transportation and distribution - for connecting sourcing locations with customers at the lowest cost by, among other things, leveraging private and third-party transportation systems; and, logistics organization development - including the seven disciplines that link enterprises across the supply chain, as well as logistics activities within those enterprises.

Abstract: The purpose of the thesis was to find elements in marketing the express companies in the case study could use as a differentiation method within the local Finnish market. Express logistics companies are global logistics providers that have overnight delivery capability. The study was commissioned by one of the companies, DHL Express. The qualitative method was used to conduct this study. Qualitative data was collected by a series of semi-structured interviews of express company customers. Four customers were interviewed so that relevant data could be extracted from all different companies in the market. All answers to the interviews differ from one another, a phenomenon common to semi-structured interviews, there were a few answers in common to all of them that allows the author to draw some general conclusions. Customer interviews revealed that the company local image comes mainly from their local product portfolio and the salesperson activities. Their improvement suggestions from customers mainly concern the products and their versatility, and also the personal touch in both products and customer service. Customer service was seen as part of the product. Improvement suggestions to sales contacts were to invest more in quality of the contacts and not the amount, and also the customers like to be taken seriously, and not for granted. In addition the author recommends that express companies involve the customer to the future advancements in both systems and products, to get the highest amount of customer satisfaction possible. Further improvements need to be made for training of both customer service individuals, sales people and marketing staff, also their actions need constant monitoring. According to this study the future products should possibly include different “building blocks” that customer can use to personalize the products to their needs. Furthermore future training of customer service and sales should include more of basic knowledge of human nature and emotional intelligence than just plain sales tactics. Marketing staff should also be trained to produce material with greater impact and quality.

"Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) is a strategic and structured approach to identify, and maximise value from, key and strategic suppliers. This book is a practical guide for anyone wanting to understand and implement the right approaches to get the most from the supply base. It is not about creating complex systems that require an army to support them but about developing clarity of focus so you are able to direct what resources you have at the suppliers who can make the biggest difference to your organization now and in the future"--

Implications of supply chain visiblity : benefits in transaction execution and resource network management
Abstract: The aim of supply chain management is the delivery and service chain optimization, cost reduction, increase in sales and enhanced customer service. In the Nordic countries, where the distances are long, it is normally necessary to maintain inventories. Another reason for inventories is often uncertainty. Inventories must be maintained as customers want fast shipping, but do not tell in advance when and how much they are going to buy different products. The supply chain management is a very practical activity. It is not solved by using statistical models, or by the IT systems. The most important part of the chain, are the people. The employees should, however, use mathematics and systems to help improve the efficiency of the supply chain.    The purpose of this work was to review old and define new purchasing parameters for Pernod Ricard Finland Oy and create a continuous process to define the parameters for the company by using mathematical and statistical methods. The goal of this research was to get better understanding of planning fluctuations and improve and define the planning parameters with fact based knowledge.    An action research study was carried out during autumn 2012 and spring 2013. This work initially examined the various theories to improve purchasing parameters, in particular the management of the safety stocks, and determined what kind of planning method should be used for planning various types of products in order to generate the best possible forecast with right information to suppliers and other parties.    Based on the theory new parameters for the purchase of Pernod Ricard Finland Oy were defined for certain products, implemented into system and the results were analyzed after few months. As the results of the research trial were promising the final result of the project was a new process and guidelines on how the purchasing parameters will be defined in the company.
