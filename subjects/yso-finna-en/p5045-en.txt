Managing international business in China
"The entire range of facilitation techniques is covered in this handbook, from pre-session tips in participant recruitment to post-session reporting. Moderating Focus Groups covers all the fundamentals of successful group facilitation, and also includes advanced techniques, such as managing group dynamics, energizing a tired group, and digging deeper into the minds of participants. Greenbaum also goes beyond the basics with chapters on how to build a business moderating focus groups, and how to price moderating services." "While this book is particularly aimed at the needs of focus group practitioners, there is plenty of advice that will benefit anyone who conducts in-depth interviews or group facilitation. Additionally, the many people who hire moderators to facilitate their sessions will benefit from this book because it will provide them with insights on how to evaluate their moderators' work."--BOOK JACKET.
