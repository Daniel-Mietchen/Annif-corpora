Abstract: Online virtual tour by panoramic photography. The purpose of the project was constructing a virtual tour, usable by a web browser of Espoo city museum's mansion museum to ensure availability of the exhibition during renovation of the premises. The project included defining the scope with the client, technical implementation based on the specifications and instructing the client on installation of the application. The virtual tour was defined as a 360 degree horizontal multi-room panorama presentation that can be viewed with both a traditional desktop computer browser and a mobile device. The virtual tour was implemented by using a DSLR system camera with high dynamic range imaging, a special panoramic tripod head and two pieces of computer software for stitching the pictures together and creating the browser platform for the virtual tour. In addition to creating the virtual tour and specifying the software and hardware, the workflow was defined, with special attention paid to the possible issues of the process. Errors might occur in handling the dynamics of interior photography, specifying the camera settings, selecting a proper camera lens and tripod and stitching the images together. The project acted as both a service done for a client and a definition of requirements for a panoramic virtual presentation. The paper can be utilised as a guide for future projects about virtual space or augmented reality.
