Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to design user interfaces of three different administrator features for social learning platform. The goal of this thesis was to design user interfaces that would offer high usability and functionality.    The Constantly growing amount of social and networking web services and the informal learning taking place in those services have changed traditional e-learning, as more formal learning style to be old-fashioned. Nowadays, many e-learning companies have started to focus more on informal learning and ways that it could be used in a corporate environment. The client company has started developing Soclet in 2009 and in 2010 the first version was ready with the idea of combining learning management systems with social features that provide informal style of learning.    The learning platform is mainly built with Ruby on Rails -framework together with HTML and JavaScript technologies. The platforms development process is managed with a variation of agile development methodologies called Scrum. Scrum is a iterative development process that is very flexible, because of the short development periods and constant prioritization of requirement tasks. Scrum was included in this thesis to keep the design work connected with the core process of project development.    Features chosen for this thesis were user account removal, user role management and the dashboard. All three features were designed starting with paper sketches and continuing with wireframe models to ensure that the final design was functional and possible to implement. The outcome was a highly usable user interface plan for each feature. User management was improved with easy way to disable user accounts and a new role management feature that makes the access control more flexible in the service. The new modular dashboard design opens new possibilities for developers to extend the administrator panel in the future..

Currently e-learning is considered an essential part of the everyday learning processes for both teachers and students in higher education. However, the learning results of e-learning are under debate and there is a growing critique on the efficiency and actual results of e-learning. In this paper we present our on-going work for exploring higher education students and teachers recent perceptions of their e-learning experiences, the usage of e-learning technologies and developing the learning process. Two surveys were conducted in order to investigate and compare the perceived advantages, challenges and needs for support among the students and teachers in higher education.  According to the results the perceived advantages of e-learning for both teachers and students were fairly similar. Flexibility in use of time and place were found as the most important benefit of e-learning. Some teachers conceived that e-learning was more activating than traditional learning in terms of increasing presence and participation. However, the results indicate that some of the students were not convinced about the activating advantages of e-learning.   The main challenges in e-learning for both students and teachers dealt with technical issues, (i.e. non-functioning data connections and software) and teacher-student interaction. Both students and teachers also experienced problems in directing the learning situation (e.g. finding/raising motivation, taking possible learning hindrances into account). Teachers also highlighted the studentsÂ¿ lack of commitment as a challenge in e-learning.  Based on the studies we suggest that in order to ensure the high-quality learning results in e-learning continuous and relevant training and peer support for educators and students are needed. Additionally it is important to enhance the user experience and the content and materials of the courses should be designed carefully. We also suggest that in e-learning the interaction between teachers and peer students should be improved.

E-Beverage Management (e-BM), a large scale educational course designed by Haaga Bachelor students deals with intricate segments of the hospitality and beverage industry while delivering management information to the learner.  A sequence of cognitive theories and practices will be acknowledged, comprehended and applied with the intention that the learner may not only become a valued employee but leader in his/her professional environment.  Within the hospitality industry, training plays a significant role in how the worker completes his/her tasks.  For this reason e-BM plays particular attention to focusing on and developing these skills giving the learner a well rounded education that allows them to step into a high level position almost immediately.  Due to the customization, accessibility and personalization features, e-learning has become one of the fastest growing mediums of education and has allowed for the inspiration of the e-BM course and its packaging into the Edulink system.  The various learning theories, practices and the entry of electronic learning and its growing acceptance around the world has enabled us to make a course worthy of acceptance and accreditation in the educational arena.  Through our research we have found no other system of learning that encompasses the amount of industry-wide information, technological facets and theories that has been accumulated and dispersed through the e-BM course.
