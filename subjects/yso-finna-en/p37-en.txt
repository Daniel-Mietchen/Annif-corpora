Music promotion case study: planning the European tour 2009 for Iro Haarla Quintet
Abstract: Managing information security in modern organizations.
English summary: At the information market. Earnings game in financial press releases in Finland.
This thesis introduces the project work of promoting a Finnish jazz band, Iro Haarla Quintet. The aim of the project was to create marketing material for the band, advertise it to jazz festival directors, and try to book the band as many concerts around Europe as possible for the year 2009. The main advertising media used to promote the band was chosen to be direct mail, using a band press kit format. Internet and a promo DVD were used as supporting media for effective mix of media. Theoretical background for the project consists of theory on advertisement management, media selection and planning, advantages and disadvantages of different media, advertising by direct mail and internet, and different aspects of advertising design. The empirical part first explains the background of the band and marketing efforts made by the band's manager prior to this project. Next, the chapter documents the steps taken in planning and executing the advertising campaign for the year 2009. The choice of media and design of the material is justified by applying the theoretical background to the made advertising choices. Finally, in the last chapter, the overall success of the project is evaluated and suggestions for executing similar projects in the future are made.
