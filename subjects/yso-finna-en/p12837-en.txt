Summary: "Work in the 21st Century is the most current, engaging, and highly regarded text for the industrial and organizational psychology course. Combining leading research, consulting, and over 40 years' combined teaching expertise, Frank J. Landy and Jeffrey M. Conte provide students with up-to-date examples and cases that link current research and theory to practical issues in the workplace. Work in the 21st Century continues to emphasize the scientist-practitioner model, showing students the connection between using the tools of science and the practice of I-O psychology. The third edition retains a number of themes from the prior edition that underscore the multifaceted nature of work such as the increase in cross-cultural work, the diversification of workforces, and the growing complexity of the technical and organizational aspects of work. To this edition the authors add authenticity as a theme, with the goal of preparing students for the 21st century workplace."--Book cover.
Safety, health and productivity of cold work:a management model, implementation and effects
Summary: Employee selection remains an integral role of industrial/organizational psychology. Modern demands on organizations have required adaptations on the part of those responsible for selection programs, and researchers in evaluating the impact of these adaptations as well as their implications for how we view human potential. Many of these developments (web-based assessments, social networking, globalization of organizations, for example) determine in great part the content and focus of many of the chapters in this book. The Oxford Handbook of Personnel Assessment and Selection is organized into seven parts: (1) historical and social context of the field of assessment and selection; (2) research strategies; (3) individual difference constructs that underlie effective performance; (4) measures of predictor constructs; (5) employee performance and outcome assessment; (6) societal and organizational constraints on selection practice; and (7) implementation and sustainability of selection systems. While providing a comprehensive review of current research and practice, the purpose of the volume is to provide an up-to-date profile of each of the areas addressed and highlight current questions that deserve additional attention from researchers and practitioners. This compendium is essential reading for industrial/organizational psychologists and human resource managers.
