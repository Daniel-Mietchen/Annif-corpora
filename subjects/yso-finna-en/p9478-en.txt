The harmonization of the Tolerance analysis calculation tool was carried out for a global company that operates in telecommunication base station industry, to be used in Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. The author works for the client companys Electromechanics maintenance organization and in close cooperation with the research and development organization. The target of the thesis work was to develop and implement a tool for the analysis of the mechanical tolerance stack-ups, to be used in the client companys global organizations. The work was completed together with the project team and following the client companys review and approval processes. The back-ground knowledge is based on the employees professional experience in analyzing the tolerance stack-ups, existing tolerance analysis tools features and technical reference books. As a result of the thesis work, a mechanical tolerance stack-up analysis tool was developed and taken in use globally in the client companys Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. User trainings covered 70 % of the mechanical designers in the implementation phase of the tool. Further development of the analysis tool would be beneficial by comparing its features with the existing similar commercial and non-commercial calculation tools. Additionally, a practical measurement trial should be executed that would result to a practical correlation between the statistical analysis and practical dimensions variation.
