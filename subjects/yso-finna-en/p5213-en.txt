Abstract: On-going change in film consumption - Is online availability disrupting the offline markets? The objective of this study was to look into the online film services in Finland and the theories connected to offering that type of online services. The aim was also to look into these services from the point of view of their disruptiveness to the market. A research was conducted to find out the current status of these online film distributors in Finland from the point of view of the customers. The research was mainly of quantitative nature and it was conducted as an online survey. The survey was answered by 123 people and in addition three persons were interviewed to gather more specific experiences and opinions on certain matters. The research revealed that most of the respondents would be willing to try online film services in the future but only few already had experience in using them. Currently more people seem to rather find films from illegal sources to download or prefer to watch them from DVD's or Blu-rays. The research also gave implications that purchasing content online is not a novelty for people anymore and what seems to keep people from using these online services are preconceptions on, for example, their quality and pricing.

This study is made to provide the company, Design Agency Tuuletin Oy, with information that is needed to better understand customers' needs. The company's business idea is to be an innovative developer and  producer of creative concepts and technical solutions in the field of digital  communications. The future plan in the company is to start marketing their products and services on the Internet. That is why the company gave  an assignment to interview prospective customers about their habits and  interests in buying digital media products and services. In the future the company also wants to grow internationally by finding more customers abroad.  One objective of this study is to describe digital media, e-business and the  possibilities of Internet marketing. A second objective is to get information  about prospective customers and their preferences, and the third objective is to study the habits and interests in buying digital media products and  services. The purpose in the theoretical part is to give a description of e-business and  the facts concerning Internet marketing and also to give an overview of  digital media. In the empirical part data was collected from prospective customers of Tuuletin Oy. Different customer groups were approached to  gather information about their habits and interests. The Internet is a very useful network for marketers nowadays. They can develop new strategies, and by creating databases of product information  their customers can selectively obtain information. This minimizes the traditional barriers of time and distance between the marketers and the  customers. Due to the fact that e-business based marketing is growing and becoming  more common, the components of the traditional marketing system are facing a number of changes. Managers are required to reorganize and  develop new strategies as to how to market in an e-business environment. The very low rate of response had an effect on the reliability of the study; as a result it is impossible to generalize the results. The respondents' answers show that digital media nowadays has an important role in a  company's activities. Companies are going to buy more digital media  products and services in the future. The responses received also show that  there is a need for the digital products that Tuuletin designs and creates.

Abstract: Luxury fashion brand influence on student purchase behavior. Fashion is a billion-dollar industry employing millions of people around the world. Due to the democratization of that volatile industry coupled with the economic recession, luxury fashion  brands have struggle to hold their ground against the rise of high street brands like Zara, H&M  and the flood of knockoffs worldwide.  Good looking, well-dressed and rich young like Mark Zuckenburg, Cristiano Ronaldo, etc. add  to the pressure put on young consumers about their appearance by the media. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the influence of luxury fashion brands on young  consumer's, namely young students, purchase behaviour. The investigation was also designed  to elucidate the factors that help the luxury fashion remain profitable despite the economic  downturn. Luxury fashion brands are assumed to have an influential impact on appearance  obsessed millennium youngsters and students who purchase luxury goods for many reasons,  which have been emphasized in this thesis. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used for this thesis. A critical review of existing brand and fashion-related literature, brand-related studies and research articles and an  analysis on the topics with emphasis on luxury fashion brands and consumer buying behaviour  constitute the source of secondary data for this thesis. An online survey targeting young  students constitutes the source of primary data. Luxury fashion with a stress on clothing and  accessories would be the case in order to narrow the study scope. The original research area  planned for this study was too wide and complex, however, the thesis was still able to identify  key factors that might determine the influence of brand selection on young consumer's  (specifically that of students) buying decisions. The research also enables the unfolding of brand loyalty in terms of being either emotional (unconscious) or attitudinal (conscious).

Purchasing management guide to selecting suppliers
Supplier evaluation and selection is today one of the most important processes that companies should be able to manage. Earlier companies produced their products and services by themselves but to increase cost efficiency many of the manufacturing processes have been outsourced to third parties while companies focus on their core competencies. This situation has resulted that the final product or service is mainly produced by third parties. The objective of this thesis was to research different ways to evaluate suppliers and create a supplier evaluation scorecard for this purpose. The research was done as a case study and it was commissioned by Etola Industrial Products (China) Co Ltd. The material used in the thesis consisted of literature related to the thesis subject, documentation of the case company, interviews and supplier audits. The interviews were organized for the case company's CEO, quality supervisor and buyers of the case company. Supplier audits were organized for Etola China ́s current suppliers and supplier candidates. The theoretical part of the thesis consists of the importance of supplier evaluation and selection and the different methods to conduct the supplier evaluation. The empirical part covers Etola China ́s current supplier evaluation and selection process and the creation of the new supplier scorecard. The supplier scorecard is used to compare performances of two different suppliers to produce a strategic component for Etola China ́s project. As a result, the supplier scorecard was designed, created, and used to evaluate and compare Chinese suppliers. With the scorecard, Etola China is able to evaluate and choose a supplier using comprehensive data and to follow the performances of its current suppliers. For the future, the supplier scorecard is going to cover all the strategic suppliers.

An increasing number of organizations have realized the importance of professionally planned and implemented purchasing. For this reason, more and more research is conducted in the field of the purchasing process in the restaurant industry. Small restaurant operations, which have similarities as well as differences with larger restaurants and restaurant chains, can also achieve better financial performance by executing a better purchasing process. Unfortunately, the research into small restaurant purchasing is not as mature as the research into other operations in the industry.      The aim of this research-based thesis is to understand what an economical purchasing process for small restaurants is.The research problem of this study is: 'what is the purchasing process that gives the optimum performance with minimum requirement of time, money and resources for small restaurant operations?'  In order to achieve the aim, first of all, the previous literature was studied and a literature framework was built. The resources that were used for the literature review are the books and online sources, as well as journals and theses from Haaga-Helia's Library.     After the literature studies, the research proceeds into the empirical research stage. This research position of this thesis is qualitative methodology. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in order to obtain and collect the data needed for this research. The interviewees selected were all restaurant professionals who have long-stand experiences in working as small restaurant managers. The interview questions were designed based on the literature review.     After the research carried out, data from interviews were transcribed, coded and organized for the purpose of analysis. Important findings are presented in chapter 4, the findings are analyzed in the same chapter. Findings and analysis helped the author to deepen the understandings on this topic.     In the conclusion chapter, based on the literature study of previous research and outcomes from empirical research, the 'economical purchasing process' was built for small restaurants. A model of the purchasing process was built up to visualize the research conclusion. In addition, findings of how to improve small restaurant purchasing were concluded as suggestions to small restaurant managers in chapter 5.

Abstract: Analysis of Attitudes towards Mobile Direct Marketing Directed to Consumers Involved in Loyalty Programs. The main objective of this dissertation was to analyze general attitudes consumers have towards mobile direct marketing, when it is executed by some company whose loyalty program they are involved in. The study was then investigating the level of interest towards such advertising. The research was based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative research, and an online survey of 94 individuals from different age groups and professions was conducted for data collection purposes. The research aimed at giving generalized view of the consumers' reaction to the topic and suggestions on how this information could be used by any company planning on incorporating mobile direct marketing to their loyalty programs. A critical review of relevant secondary data was carried out to get insight on consumer behavior, when it comes to loyalty programs and mobile direct marketing. The literature review discusses in general terms of the topic related concepts of marketing and consumer behavior, and finishes with introducing the different uses and types of mobile direct marketing. This information gave the basis for primary research. Results of the research placed some of the theory of secondary data under consideration, and further recommendation for research would therefore be focusing on viral activity related to loyalty program messages as well as realization of paid-for ordering service. Limitations of research include the absence of a commissioner, which affects the reliability of the primary research results.

This thesis was developed in order to help the commissionaire, the Microscopy and Nanotechnology Centre at Oulu University (MNT), acquire a better understanding of the current state of the market for material analyses services in Northern Bothnia region. The main purpose of this research paper is, by using applied marketing research tools- a quantitative survey, to collect as much information possible about the customers who are purchasing material analyses in the region. The main research areas have been value creation and customers’ satisfaction, regular customer behaviour and information channels used in the purchasing process. The background analyses included a theory review of B2B marketing and the organizational behaviour in specific. Moreover a SME framework has been drawn, also the buying behaviour in organizations and the value creation has been discussed to provide to the reader a theoretical fundament for the research to come. The conveyed survey managed to successfully attract respondents in order to provide valid answers to the preliminary objectives. The main conclusions have been made in reference with the building ideal material analyses service and in considerations with the future trends on the market. A material service provider that is fast, reliable, cooperative, versatile and experienced has been stated to be the most desired research partner.

Abstract: The impact of in-store customer service on postpurchase impulse-buying behaviour : a case study based on Gallery, a street fashion store. The purpose of this study is to research how in-store customer service can affect satisfied impulse purchasers' postpurchase behaviour in terms of store returns. The results of this study revealed that in-store customer service can positively affect impulse-buyers' postpurchase evaluations of service, and by increasing the level of in-store service the sales personnel can influence the customers' cognitions, and move an initial impulse purchase into a permanent adoption (Kang & Johnson, 2009). This in return can minimise store returns. This study provides information as to why in-store customer service should be considered as a part of the strategic store environment, and how service-oriented emphasis can influence impulse-buying behaviour.
