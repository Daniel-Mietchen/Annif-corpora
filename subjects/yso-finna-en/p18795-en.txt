Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response to increased cardiac workload. It is initially beneficial, since it helps to maintain cardiac output, but ultimately it is considered as an independent predictor for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The cardiac hypertrophic response is triggered by mechanical and neurohumoral stimuli and is associated with the activation of complex changes in gene programming and intracellular signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of some novel load-induced factors i.e. melusin, thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and -4 and LIM and cysteine-rich domains protein 1 (LMCD1)/dyxin during the hypertrophic response. Melusin was expressed in cardiac tissue both in the atria and ventricles, furthermore its expression was very rapidly activated in response to multiple hypertrophic stimuli predominantly in the left atria. Melusin gene expression was activated when cultured cardiac myocytes were subjected to mechanical stretch or hypertrophic agonists such as endothelin-1 or angiotensin (Ang II). TSP-1 and TSP-4 gene expressions were rapidly activated at an early stage of pressure overload. Myocardial infarction (MI) induced the expression of both TSP-4 and TSP-1 mRNA in the heart. TSP-4 may also be an endothelial cell-specific marker of pressure overload since its expression was limited to endothelial cells in the adult heart. The expression of LMCD1/dyxin was found to be induced during the cardiac hypertrophic response and after MI. By itself, mechanical load was a critical regulator of LMCD1/dyxin gene expression. LMCD1/dyxin is a putative novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) target since adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p38 MAPK upregulated LMCD1/dyxin expression. In addition, during the Ang II-induced pressure overload p38 MAPK phosphorylation levels correlated with the early induction of LMCD1/dyxin expression.In conclusion, this study provides new information on the expression of melusin, TSP-1 and -4 and LMCD1/dyxin in the cardiac hypertrophic response. Early induction of their gene expression may represent an initial step in the adaptive and protective remodeling processes following increased workload in the heart.
