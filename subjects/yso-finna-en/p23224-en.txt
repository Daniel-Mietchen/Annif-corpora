The main purpose of this thesis is to give Case Company A clear view of their customer's needs in the area of electronic reporting and support services. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the fields of electronic reporting and electronic business management, research Case Company A's customer reporting needs, and to include how and when these reports should be delivered. A third objective is to study the reporting needs of different types of customer groups. These groups are divided according to years as an entrepreneur, number of full-time employees and turnover in 2008. Empirical research was a survey drawn-up Case Company A's customers in order to find out what type of reporting services would best support their business planning and decision-making. An empirical study was carried out as an Internet-based survey supported by personal interviews. The survey conducted for the thesis shows a clear need for support in using the reporting tools. The results also showed that the customers saw written analysis and graphic illustrations as useful parts of the accounting and payroll reports. Different customer characteristics were compared with reporting needs. The needs of the companies with a large turnover were significantly different compared with companies with a smaller turnover. Comparison of the number of personnel and entrepreneurs' years of experience did not provide clear results. By analysing the survey results, the following recommendations are given to Case Company A: training customers and personnel, changing  negative attitudes, developing the procedures and reporting.
