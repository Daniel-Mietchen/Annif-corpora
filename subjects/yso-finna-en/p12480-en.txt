Johnny Marr was born in 1960s Manchester to Irish emigrant parents and knew from an early age that he would be a musician. Forming his first band at thirteen, Marr spent his teenage years on the council estates of Wythenshawe playing guitar, devouring pop culture and inventing his own musical style. It wasn't until the early eighties, when Marr turned up on the doorstep of a singer named Steven Patrick Morrissey, that both a unique songwriting partnership and the group recognised as one of the most iconic bands of all time were formed. In 1983 The Smiths released their first single, and within a year their eponymous debut album reached number two in the UK chart, paving the way for mainstream and critical success on their own never stopped. Here, for the first time, he tells his own side of the story.

Essentially discographical in format, this book updates the original work compiled by Charles Delauney in 1960, and draws on later work by Gould, Nevers, Royal and Rust, to detail all known recordings by Reinhardt, together with known film, radio and television appearances. For each entry Paul Vernon provides, where known, the location of the recording, the date, the artist credit as it appears on the label of the original issue, the performers and the instruments played by them, the matrix number, the exact timing of the recording and details of 78, LP, EP and CD issues.
With songs like 'The Weight', 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' and 'Up on Cripple Creek', songwriter/guitarist Robbie Robertson and his partners in The Band introduced a musical lexicon, one soaked in the mythology of the Old South that has influenced countless musicians. In this remarkable memoir, Robertson weaves together his rollicking years with rockabilly Ronnie Hawkins: The Band's formation and trial-by-fire supporting Bob Dylan on his '66 world tour, and the cloistered sessions leading to their unique sound.
