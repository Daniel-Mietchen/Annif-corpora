Meshfree methods for the solution of partial differential equations gained much attention in recent years, not only in the engineering but also in the mathematics community. One of the reasons for this development is the fact that meshfree discretizations and particle models are often better suited to cope with geometric changes of the domain of interest, e.g. free surfaces and large deformations, than classical discretization techniques such as finite differences, finite elements or finite volumes. Another obvious advantage of meshfree discretizations is their independence of a mesh so that the costs of mesh generation are eliminated. Also, the treatment of time-dependent PDEs from a Lagrangian point of view and the coupling of particle models and continuous models gained enormous interest in recent years from a theoretical as well as from a practial point of view. This volume consists of articles which address the different meshfree methods (SPH, PUM, GFEM, EFGM, RKPM etc.) and their application in applied mathematics, physics and engineering.

The subject of partial differential equations has an unchanging core of material but is constantly expanding and evolving. The core consists of solution methods, mainly separation of variables, for boundary value problems with constant coeffiÂ­ cients in geometrically simple domains. Too often an introductory course focuses exclusively on these core problems and techniques and leaves the student with the impression that there is no more to the subject. Questions of existence, uniqueness, and well-posedness are ignored. In particular there is a lack of connection between the analytical side of the subject and the numerical side. Furthermore nonlinear problems are omitted because they are too hard to deal with analytically. Now, however, the availability of convenient, powerful computational software has made it possible to enlarge the scope of the introductory course. My goal in this text is to give the student a broader picture of the subject. In addition to the basic core subjects, I have included material on nonlinear problems and brief discussions of numerical methods. I feel that it is important for the student to see nonlinear problems and numerical methods at the beginning of the course, and not at the end when we run usually run out of time. Furthermore, numerical methods should be introduced for each equation as it is studied, not lumped together in a final chapter.

This volume presents advances that have been made over recent decades in areas of research featuring Hardy's inequality and related topics. The inequality and its extensions and refinements are not only of intrinsic interest but are indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Hardy inequalities on domains have a substantial role and this necessitates a detailed investigation of significant geometric properties of a domain and its boundary. Other topics covered in this volume are Hardy- Sobolev-Mazya inequalities; inequalities of Hardy-type involving magnetic fields; Hardy, Sobolev and Cwikel-Lieb-Rosenbljum inequalities for Pauli operators; the Rellich inequality. The Analysis and Geometry of Hardys Inequality provides an up-to-date account of research in areas of contemporary interest and would be suitable for a graduate course in mathematics or physics. A good basic knowledge of real and complex analysis is a prerequisite.

The numerical treatment of partial differential equations with particle methods and meshfree discretization techniques is a very active research field both in the mathematics and engineering community. Due to their independence of a mesh, particle schemes and meshfree methods can deal with large geometric changes of the domain more easily than classical discretization techniques. Furthermore, meshfree methods offer a promising approach for the coupling of particle models to continuous models. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Meshfree Methods held in September 2003 in Bonn. The articles address the different meshfree methods (SPH, PUM, GFEM, EFGM, RKPM, etc.) and their application in applied mathematics, physics and engineering. The volume is intended to foster this new and exciting area of interdisciplinary research and to present recent advances and results in this field.
This text on partial differential equations is intended for readers who want to understand the theoretical underpinnings of modern PDEs in settings that are important for the applications without using extensive analytic tools required by most advanced texts. The assumed mathematical background is at the level of multivariable calculus and basic metric space material, but the latter is recalled as relevant as the text progresses. The key goal of this book is to be mathematically complete without overwhelming the reader, and to develop PDE theory in a manner that reflects how researchers would think about the material. A concrete example is that distribution theory and the concept of weak solutions are introduced early because while these ideas take some time for the students to get used to, they are fundamentally easy and, on the other hand, play a central role in the field. Then, Hilbert spaces that are quite important in the later development are introduced via completions which give essentially all the features one wants without the overhead of measure theory.

The numerical treatment of partial differential equations with particle methods and meshfree discretization techniques is an extremely active research field, both in the mathematics and engineering communities. Meshfree methods are becoming increasingly mainstream in various applications. Due to their independence of a mesh, particle schemes and meshfree methods can deal with large geometric changes of the domain more easily than classical discretization techniques. Furthermore, meshfree methods offer a promising approach for the coupling of particle models to continuous models. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Meshfree Methods, held in Bonn in August 2009. The articles address the different meshfree methods and their use in applied mathematics, physics and engineering.

The goal of this work is to present the principles of functional analysis in a clear and concise way. The first three chapters of Functional Analysis: Fundamentals and Applications describe the general notions of distance, integral and norm, as well as their relations. The three chapters that follow deal with fundamental examples: Lebesgue spaces, dual spaces and Sobolev spaces. Two subsequent chapters develop applications to capacity theory and elliptic problems. In particular, the isoperimetric inequality and the PoÌlya-SzegoÌ and Faber-Krahn inequalities are proved by purely functional methods. The epilogue contains a sketch of the history of functional analysis, in relation with integration and differentiation.
A posteriori error estimates for variational problems in the theory of viscous fluids
"For mathematicians and engineers interested in applying numerical methods to physical problems this book is ideal. Numerical ideas are connected to accompanying software, which is also available online. By seeing the complete description of the methods in both theory and implementation, students will more easily gain the knowledge needed to write their own application programs or develop new theory. The book contains careful development of the mathematical tools needed for analysis of the numerical methods, including elliptic regularity theory and approximation theory. Variational crimes, due to quadrature, coordinate mappings, domain approximation and boundary conditions, are analyzed. The claims are stated with full statement of the assumptions and conclusions, and use subscripted constants which can be traced back to the origination (particularly in the electronic version, which is available online and on the accompanying CD-ROM)"--
Smoothness properties of solutions to Dirichlet problems in domains with a fractal boundary
Electromagnetic wave propagation in non-homogeneous waveguides
The present volume develops the theory of integration in Banach spaces, martingales and UMD spaces, and culminates in a treatment of the Hilbert transform, Littlewood-Paley theory and the vector-valued Mihlin multiplier theorem. Over the past fifteen years, motivated by regularity problems in evolution equations, there has been tremendous progress in the analysis of Banach space-valued functions and processes. The contents of this extensive and powerful toolbox have been mostly scattered around in research papers and lecture notes. Collecting this diverse body of material into a unified and accessible presentation fills a gap in the existing literature. The principal audience that we have in mind consists of researchers who need and use Analysis in Banach Spaces as a tool for studying problems in partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and stochastic analysis. Self-contained and offering complete proofs, this work is accessible to graduate students and researchers with a background in functional analysis or related areas.
