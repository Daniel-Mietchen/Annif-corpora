This important cultural analysis tells two stories about food. The first depicts good food as democratic. Foodies frequent 'hole in the wall' ethnic eateries, appreciate the pie found in working-class truck stops, and reject the snobbery of fancy French restaurants with formal table service. The second story describes how food operates as a source of status and distinction for economic and cultural elites, indirectly maintaining and reproducing social inequality.
Food and Architecture" is the first book to explore, interrogate and illuminate the reciprocity between these two distinct fields of study and practice. Both disciplines rely on a combination of intuition, inventiveness, even wonder, but until recently have seldom come into dialogue with one another. Bringing together leading voices to provide an authoritative, cross-disciplinary exploration of the reciprocity between eating and building, this volume demonstrates how the fields of food studies and architecture can learn from each other. Each section focuses on a core area where food and architecture overlap - Regionalism, Sustainability, Craft and Authenticity - using these to introduce a variety of case studies exploring these themes. Covering topics ranging from pig slaughtering and farmhouses in Greece, to the possibility of an authentic American Cuisine, contributors employ a range of vantage points and methodologies, such as practice-based research, literary analysis, memoir, and voice narrative. Each section is concluded with a commentary, drawing out key themes and connections between chapters. This lively and compelling book will be invaluable reading for food studies and architecture students and will appeal to practicing architects and chefs.
