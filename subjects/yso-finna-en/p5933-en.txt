International financial statistics : supplement on fund accounts
Investment funds have emerged as significant financial intermediaries in Finland since the turn of the millennium. In this role, they supplement traditional deposit banking. However, from the perspective of financial stability, investment funds may also involve risks reminiscent of banking. One such key risk is if assets invested in funds are converted into significantly less liquid (less cash-convertible) form. Why can such liquidity transformation in a worst-case scenario pose a risk to financial stability, and how extensively is it performed among Finnish investment funds?.

The purpose of this thesis, commissioned by Beach Horizon LLP, was to investigate the investor relationship management of a startup hedge fund. To fulfil the purpose of the thesis, the research consisted of four objectives as follows:  - provide basic understanding of a hedge fund. How they operate and who the investors are  - analyze the need for an investor relationship management for young hedge fund managers  - introduce different investors and analyse their investment requirements  - give future recommendations for startup hedge fund managers   Information for this research was collected by desk and field research. Data was collected from financial literature, different articles and publications. Field research was done during the author's work placement period in Beach Horizon LLP. That gave the author good insight into a young hedge fund's operations and hedge fund management.  The hedge fund industry has grown rapidly and consequently this has increased the competition between start up hedge fund managers of investors. Investor relationship management is valuable for young managers in capital attraction. The research emphasises trading philosophy, performance of the fund and people working in the fund, which are necessary in successful investor relationship management.

Who really runs the global economy? Who benefits most from it? The answer is a triad of 'governance institutions' - The IMF, the World Bank and the WTO. Globalization massively increased the power of these institutions and they drastically affected the livelihoods of peoples across the world. Yet they operate undemocratically and aggressively promote a particular kind of neoliberal capitalism. Under the 'Washington Consensus' they proposed, poverty was to be ended by increasing inequality. This new edition of "Unholy Trinity", completely updated and revised, argues that neoliberal global capitalism has now entered a period of crisis so severe that governance will become impossible. Huge incomes for a small number of super-rich people produced an unstable global economy, rife with speculation and structurally prone to crises. The IMF is in disgrace, the WTO can hardly meet anymore and the World Bank survives as a global philanthropist. Is this the end for the Unholy Trinity?
