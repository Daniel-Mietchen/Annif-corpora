Fundamentals of instrumentation and measurement
presented to back up the design principles of the module. Testing of the design was done with a Xilinx XSA 35 1000 prototyping board. Simulated test data set was uploaded into the SDRAM memory for testing the design. The test board logic was implemented partially, but an SDRAM controller and new UART module had to be integrated to it.

Future wireless systems will require high data rate with low transmit and processing power consumption. A combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising approach for offering better performance in terms of the capacity and quality of service (QoS). The detector in the wireless receiver is one of the highest power consuming parts. In order to minimize the power consumption, it is desirable for the detector to be able to change the detection algorithm to suit the channel conditions.In this thesis work, we study the suitability of different MIMO detection algorithms for adaptive operation. The selective spanning with fast enumeration (SSFE), K-best list sphere detector (LSD), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detectors are compared to each other in terms of communications performance in the 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 MIMO–OFDM systems. The impact of least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation methods, mobile speed, and transmit precoding at the base station on detector algorithm selection is also considered. The SIC detector is shown to suffer from error propagation in poor channel conditions. The SSFE detector is unable to outperform the K-best LSD and is occasionally outperformed by the LMMSE detector. The LMMSE detector is able to outperform the K-best LSD on the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime when the mobile speed is high and the spatial channel correlation is low or moderate; it is also found to be more robust against channel estimation errors. Because a realistic adaptive detector is expected to support only two detection algorithms, the K-best LSD and LMMSE are selected based on the performance results for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) architecture design and further comparison.The chosen algorithms are evaluated by considering the performance and implementation results. The K-best LSD provides good performance under challenging channel conditions with the cost of high complexity and power consumption. The LMMSE detector is energy efficient but performs poorly in correlated channels. However, exceptions exist, and detailed results on when to use a simple detector and when to use a complex detector are provided.

This package is aimed at ships' officers and similar shore-based personnel whose duties include the use of portable gas detectors. It explains that portable gas detectors are a vital part of safety procedures. They must be used, and used properly, when it's appropriate. It's to the individual's personal benefit and the benefit of the people they work with or control. Many people forget that some spaces on ships and in terminals - cargo or gas tanks, for instance - are, under normal circumstances, totally unable to support life for one reason or another. That, not unnaturally, makes them very dangerous environments. There are any number of ways in which a space can become hazardous. The package covers many of the most common and shows how portable gas detectors can help. Set on board various types of ship, including tankers and cargo ships and ashore in terminal, the package shows a wide range of equipment, including modern devices and older designs which are still widely used. The package covers the three main areas in which portable gas detectors are used: detecting flammable gases, toxic gases, and checking for oxygen - usually to ensure that the air is safe to breathe. Each of these is covered in a separate section. Typical situations are featured in each. The package explains why gas detectors are used in each of these three areas. It also highlights the need to make sure that each person watching and the people with whom they work are safe...
