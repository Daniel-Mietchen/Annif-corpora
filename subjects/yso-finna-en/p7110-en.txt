Musical Instruments : their History in Western Culture from the Stone Age to the Present Day
Despite their central role in many forms of music-making, drummers have been largely neglected in the scholarly literature on music and education. But kit drummers are increasingly difficult to ignore. While exponents of the drum kit are frequently mocked in popular culture, they are also widely acknowledged to be central to the musical success and aesthetic appeal of any musical ensemble in which they are found. Drummers are also making their presence felt in music education, with increasing opportunities to learn their craft in formal contexts. Drawing on data collected from in-depth interviews and questionnaires, Gareth Dylan Smith explores the identities, practices and learning of teenage and adult kit drummers in and around London. As a London-based drummer and teacher of drummers, Smith uses his own identity as participant-researcher to inform and interpret other drummers' accounts of their experiences. Drummers learn in multi-modal ways, usually with a keen awareness of exemplars of their art and craft. The world of kit drumming is highly masculine, which presents opportunities and challenges to drummers of both sexes. Smith proposes a new model of the 'Snowball Self', which incorporates the constructs of identity realization, learning realization, meta-identities and contextual identities. Kit drummers' identities, practices and learning are found to be intertwined, as drummers exist in a web of interdependence. Drummers drum; therefore they are, they do, and they learn - in a rich tapestry of means and contexts.

This volume by one of the legends of Tibetan Singing Bowl playing should quickly establish itself as the definitive study. Particularly useful is the wide scope of the book, which includes not just Tibetan bowls and the techniques used to sound them but Chinese bells, drilbu and ding-sha, the planets, elements and chakras, cymatics, overtones and partials, nada yoga, mantras, symbolism and the astrology of the bowls, their relation to western music, Pythagoras and Newton, and the psychic integrity and true awareness of the bowl user. There is almost nothing that is not here. Although Frank Perry was one of the earliest practitioners of Himalayan Bowls in the 1970s, his music has remained profoundly experimental, so that there are techniques in this book not to be found elsewhere, alongside the clearest and most detailed analysis of how to 'play' the bowls, a combination of simple and technical that shows in Perry's bestselling albums Deep Peace and Celestial Harmonies. Frank's writing is also a revelation of his personal contact with living Himalayan Masters, his immersion in esoteric traditions, meditation and mysticism, and his understanding of other art forms such as the paintings of Nicholas Roerich, where he is an expert.
