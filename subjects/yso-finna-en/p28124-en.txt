harmonic analysis
Harmonic analysis and partial differential equations : 8th international conference on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, June 16-20, 2008, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
A comprehensive course in analysis
This book provides a modern introduction to harmonic analysis and synthesis on topological groups. It serves as a guide to the abstract theory of Fourier transformation. For the first time, it presents a detailed account of the theory of classical harmonic analysis together with the recent developments in spectral analysis and synthesis. Selected problems and exercises will provide readers with a better understanding of the topics and some open problems may inspire further research.
