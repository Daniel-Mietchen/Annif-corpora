The goal of the thesis project was to design a concept prototype of a hand-held tool and to use components in the products the company has designed. The tool had to develop a 55kN force, maximum cycle time was four seconds and the hand part of the tool could weight no more than two kilograms. In the first phase goals were defined and the information was gathered on the projected loading cycle, lifetime, different solutions, components and techniques used in them. The solution concepts were compared using a morphological table and calculations files done with MatLab program. Based on the rankings and performance calculations, two basic design choices were compared: an electro-mechanical and an electro-hydraulic solution. The electro-hydraulic solution was chosen for further development. For it a new aluminium double acting hydraulic cylinder was designed along with a plastic tool body. Two different basic models of the tool were made for appraisal and one of them was chosen for development. The 3D-model, static loading simulations, 2D-drawings and initial failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) were done for this solution. Performance goals for the tool were met but the tool was 300 g over the weight limit set of two kilograms. The conclusions of this project are useful for the company as they can make a prototype based on 2D drawings and use the information gathered on further development of the tool. A thorough report of the work done is included in the report given to FELCO Motion SA. The public thesis focuses on the basic theory used in the project and on the design of the hydraulic cylinder.

This book focuses on applications for offshore platforms and piping; wind-induced vibration of buildings, bridges, and towers; and acoustic and mechanical vibration of heat exchangers, power lines, and process ducting. Numerous examples drive home the reality of the practical problems encountered here. More than 200 figures and 20 tables complement the text by providing such data as damping factors, lift coefficients, and the formulas needed to apply practical methods directly to a wide range of structures, from heat exchangers to hypersonic aircraft. Devoted to the analysis and prediction of flow-induced vibrations, this volume will prove of immense interest to mechanical, civil, nuclear, marine, structural, and electrical engineers; physicists, designers, and naval architects; and people working in the construction and petroleum industries, power plants, power transmission, ship building, nuclear power, energy production, and defense engineering.

The customer of this project is Planora Ltd, which is primarily an energy planning company with knowledge and experience in the entire energy field, including industrial planning, project management and consulting activities. The aim of this thesis is to compare programs for designing district heating networks, GIS Zulu and Termis. The particular aim is to perform the hydraulic calculations of Prääsä district heating network in GIS Zulu and Termis and then to compare the results and process of calculations. The research is carried out with taking into account the requirements for designing district heating networks and software used in the territory of Russia. The comparative analysis presents the features and possibilities of GIS Zulu and Termis. This thesis introduces the GIS Zulu program to Planora Ltd in comparison with Termis currently used in the customer company. Also, the thesis might be used by companies that want to use their programs in the Russian market, as the thesis contains the requirements for software.
