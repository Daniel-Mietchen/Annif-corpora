Singin' in the rain : the making of an American masterpiece
Bluey the little drip is the story of raindrops on their journey around the world. Bluey has been at the bottom of the Blue lagoon and this is the first time that he floated to the top. He was enjoying his time under the sun when all of a sudden he's evaporated and floats up into the sky and settles within a cloud full of raindrops he had never met before. He befriends a rather pretty droplet named Clara and she explains to him where he has come from and where they are going. Described by the media as education, dressed up as an enjoyable tale. Teachers have found that by reading the book to the class it awakens interest in the weather and follow the story into a lesson on the environment. Suitable for children from 4 to 8 years old and you will be amazed at how much children will love having the story read to them again and again. This is the first in a series of books and the second story 'Bluey Meets Father Christmas' has also been released.
