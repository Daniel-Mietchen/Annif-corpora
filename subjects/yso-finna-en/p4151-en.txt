Learning and Teaching with Geomedia provides a theoretical and practical introduction to a field explicitly aimed at secondary education. The first section consists of three scientific papers introducing the dimensions of the emerging geoinformation society. The second section of the book is specifically dedicated to teacher trainers and teachers. The introductory section provides an overview of the development of geomedia and envisions a roadmap of technological development ahead; a discussion of everyday geomedia applications and geomedia use; and, finally, pedagogical approaches using geomedia in secondary education. This section provides a broad foundation that does not argue in favor of a technological paradigm, but suggests that geomedia use in secondary education should be oriented at everyday life applications. The main section is devoted to exemplary learning environments that are ready to use, and easily transferable to local schools. While geoinformation technology is the basis of these learning environments, care has been taken to clearly identify conceptual approaches to these learning environments, and, therefore, make them less reliant on technology locally available. Many of these are easily applied without any further software or hardware other than a web browser and a mobile phone. The pedagogical background of these learning environments leads from science education and spatial thinking to learning environments that support an education for spatial citizenship, reflected geomedia use and communication with maps to successfully participate in society. The book is aimed at academics in the fields of pedagogy, geography and citizenship education, as well as those working in science education. The professional audiences addressed are teacher trainers at university departments, teachers in secondary schools and students in teacher

This truly comprehensive reference, in a mini-series format with five volumes, offers a detailed description of both well-known and recently introduced methods for percutaneous penetration enhancement. The first three volumes are devoted to the broad range of chemical methods used to enhance the skin delivery of drugs, including the vast variety of chemical penetration enhancers, drug and vehicle manipulation strategies, nanocarriers, and many others. The fourth volume discusses the diverse physical methods used in penetration enhancement, such as sonophoresis, iontophoresis, electroporation, microporation, laser ablation, and microneedles. Determination of drug penetration is covered in the final volume, with a focus especially on mathematics in skin permeation and modern analytical techniques adapted to assess and measure penetration. This edition of Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers will be an invaluable resource for researchers, pharmaceutical scientists, practitioners, and also students.
