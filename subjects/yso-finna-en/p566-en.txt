Everyone has the capacity to dance right now. With A Sense of Dance, you will learn about the physical expression of dance, gain confidence in your movement potential, and discover your own creativity. Written in a conversational tone, this interactive text will inspire you to develop creative thinking, reasoning skills, and self-expression. Through the use of examples and exercises based on nonstudio experiences, you'll learn how to translate your life experiences into the art of dance. You'll also acquire the tools necessary to appreciate, discuss, and write about dance as a fine art. Plus you'll find your own voice as a choreographer and a dance appreciator. In this book you'll find important information on the ways we use our bodies to be expressive, how we instinctively apply the elements of dance in daily life, dance exploration basics and the elements of movement, how to develop your own dance perceptions and creative resources, and how to translate your perceptions into dance. Whatever your level of artistic awareness, this engaging text will help you tap into the power and energy of dance.

What does it mean to be expressive in music performance across diverse historical and cultural domains? What are the means at the disposal of a performer in various time periods and musical practice conventions? What are the conceptualisations of expression and the roles of performers that shape expressive performance? This book brings together research from a range of disciplines that use diverse methodologies to provide new perspectives and formulate answers to these questions about the meaning, means, and contextualisation of expressive performance in music. The contributors to this book explore expressiveness in music performance in four interlinked parts. Starting with the philosophical and historical underpinnings crucially relevant for Western classical musical performance it then reaches out to cross-cultural issues and finally focuses the attention on various specific problems, including the teaching of expressive music performance skills. The overviews provide a focussed and comprehensive account of the current state of research as well as new developments and a prospective of future directions.
