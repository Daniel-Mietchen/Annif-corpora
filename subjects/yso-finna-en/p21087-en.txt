A handbook of human resource management practice
The collapse of major corporations during the global financial crisis, major accidents, and strategic mistakes resulting from mismanagement, have highlighted the crucial role that bad decision making has in creating disasters. People are at the core of corporate success and failure. Researchers in behavioral psychology have discovered that individual persons and groups are not good at making decisions as they fall prey to human biases, giving rise to the term "people risk." Risk management experts Keith Blacker and Patrick McConnell provide a business-friendly introduction to behavioral psychology, explaining how biases, illusions, and conflicts of interest can lead board members, managers, and employees to make potentially disastrous decisions. Using case studies and examples, the authors demonstrate how crucial people risk management is and how ineffective risk management can create crises. They also offer practical tips and tools for changing the culture and structure of organizations to better align people risks with corporate values and provide advice on managing the roles and responsibilities of those directly involved in overseeing risk and people management" --

"Jack Welch's Straight from the Gut was once the essential primer for managers, but today's leaders need a new playbook. In HOW GOOGLE WORKS, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg distill their decades of working in the high-tech industry into a practical and fun-to-read guide for those who want to succeed in an ever-changing business landscape. The book offers how-to advice on strategy, corporate culture, talent, decision-making, innovation, communication and dealing with disruption. The authors explain how the confluence of three seismic changes--the internet, mobile, and cloud computing--has shifted the balance of power between consumer and corporation. The companies that thrive will be the ones that create superior products and attract a new breed of multi-faceted employees whom the authors dub "smart creatives." The management maxims are illustrated with previously unreported anecdotes from Google's corporate history. "Back in 2010, Eric and I created an internal class for Google managers focusing on the lessons the management team learned the hard way," says Rosenberg. "The class slides all said 'Google confidential' until an employee suggested we uphold the spirit of openness and share them with the world. This book codifies the recipe for our secret sauce: how Google innovates and how Google empowers employees to succeed.""--
