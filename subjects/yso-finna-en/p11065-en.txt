This handbook illustrates how education scholars employ Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a framework to bring attention to issues of race and racism in education. It is the first authoritative reference work to provide a truly comprehensive description and analysis of the topic, from the defining conceptual principles of CRT in the Law that gave shape to its radical underpinnings to the political and social implications of the field today. It is divided into three sections, covering innovations in educational research, policy and practice in both schools and in higher education, and the increasing interdisciplinary nature of critical race research. With 28 newly commissioned pieces written by the most renowned scholars in the field, this handbook provides the definitive statement on the state of critical race theory in education and on its possibilities for the future.

This book is a collection of papers presented in the Finnish Educational Research Association Conference on Education FERA 2013, which was held in University of Jyväskylä in November 21-22, 2013. The title of the book, Enabling Education, encompasses the conference theme − Education for future well-being and teaching excellence. The word Education has purposefully been written with a capital letter in the book title. Education with a big E is something which initiates us into the kinds of practices that foster the good life for each person and the good for humankind. The capital letter implies that Education with a big E is something more than schooling which has transformed education into standardized, factory-like practices. As the keynote speaker of the conference Stephen Kemmis puts it: ”Schooling is to produce people with skills for production and the means for consumption, and people who are willing providers and grateful clients of services. (…) Education, by contrast, is a process of individual and collective self-formation, a simultaneous process of growing good selves and good societies.” Education with a big E is not limited to conventional school-based settings. It happens in everyday life, and it is a life-long journey. It may take place outdoors and through adventures as well as in peoples��� homes, on trains and streets via portable electronic devices. It may be about cultural education − music, arts, and crafts as well as literature, video clips, and digital stories. Education requires inter-professional collaboration and presupposes the strong agency of the educators. Education is something very practical and simultaneously deeply philosophical and ethical. The eleven chapters of this book shed light on all these aspects of Education with a big E.

Many teachers want to contribute to children's moral development, but this desire has not always resulted in a profound grasp of what 'moral education' really means, why it would be desirable and how it can best be achieved. This book confronts these questions by examining what Aristotelian virtue ethics can illuminate about moral education. At the same time, it evaluates whether Aristotelian theory can still be useful for contemporary educational practice. The argument culminates in a morally justified and psychologically realistic account of how virtue can best be taught in schools. The approach, called 'character education', sees moral education not as enforcing rules or transferring values in separate subjects. Instead, it encourages teachers - whatever subject they teach - to be a 'morally exemplary teacher', which is revealed through all kinds of small decisions and emotional reactions. This philosophical essay takes a constructive but critical stance towards empirical research about the effectiveness of teaching methods and the realism of character traits.
