Bayesian analysis
"This book will show you how to think like a statistician, without worrying about formal statistical techniques. Along the way we'll learn how selection bias can explain why your boss doesn't know he sucks (even when everyone else does); how to use Bayes' Theorem to decide if your partner is cheating on you; and why Mark Zuckerberg should never be used as an example for anything. See the world in a whole new light, and make better decisions and judgements without ever going near a t-test. Think. Think Statistically." -T.p. verso.

This book offers a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of Bayesian Networks. Bayesian networks are a topic of interest and importance for statisticians, computer scientists and those involved in modelling and the learning of complex data sets. The material included in this introductory guide has been extensively tested in classroom teaching and assumes a basic knowledge of probability and statistics course and basic mathematics. All notions are explained carefully with an extensive set of exercises throughout the book as well as computer exercises. A solutions manual is also provided online.
