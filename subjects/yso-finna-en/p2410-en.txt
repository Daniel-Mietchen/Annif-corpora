This textbook provides a strong foundation and a clear overview for students of membrane biology and an invaluable synthesis of cutting edge research for working scientists. The text retains its clear and engaging style, providing a solid background in membrane biochemistry, while also incorporating the approaches of biophysics, genetics and cell biology to investigations of membrane structure, function and biogenesis to provide a unique overview of this fast-moving field. A wealth of new high resolution structures of membrane proteins are presented, including the Na/K pump and a receptor-G protein complex, offering exciting insights into how they function. All key tools of current membrane research are described, including detergents and model systems, bioinformatics, protein-folding methodology, crystallography and diffraction and molecular modeling. This comprehensive and up-to-date text, emphasizing the correlations between membrane research and human health, provides a solid foundation for all those working in this field.
