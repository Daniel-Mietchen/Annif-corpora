Truth tales : contemporary writing by Indian women
This title comes with an introduction by Mohammed Hanif. In the 1930s and 40s, Bombay was the cosmopolitan capital of the subcontinent - an exhilarating hub of license and liberty, bursting with both creative energy and helpless degradation. It was also muse to the celebrated short story writer of India and Pakistan, Saadat Hasan Manto. His hard-edged, moving stories remain, a hundred years after his birth, startling and provocative. In searching out those forgotten by humanity - prostitutes, conmen and crooks - Manto wrote about what it means to be human. Matt Reeck and Aftab Ahmad's translations reach into the streets and capture Manto's world in contemporary, idiomatic English.
