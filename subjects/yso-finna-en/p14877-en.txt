"Treatment of traumatic injuries is increasing in importance for physical therapists active in hospitals and private practice. In addition to the bone, joint, and soft tissue injuries incurred in sports, physical therapists are seeing more and more traumas associated with aging and with high-speed accidents. This great variety of injury types increases the complexity of treatment. Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for the most complete restoration possible of both physical and psychological function. This is the principal objective of aftercare. Accordingly, this book focuses on a comprehensive presentation of individual injuries and their effect on function, as well as the guidelines and potential results of physical therapy treatment. It is addressed to students, practitioners, and teachers of physical therapy who must master and apply an understanding of the whole range of injuries, their consequences, and their treatment.
