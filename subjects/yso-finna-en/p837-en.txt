Current travel situation of young people on Viking Line ferries
This thesis was conducted together with Viking Line in order to analyse the current travel situation of young people on Viking Line ferries. Viking Line wished especially this thesis to find out things young people are interested in to do on their ferries and what young people in general want from Viking Line. In addition, young people were also asked possible improvement suggestion of Viking Line's services. A young person in this thesis is a student between the ages of 12 to 17 years old. This thesis was a quantitative research and the research method used was questionnaires. Semi-structured questionnaire was used for the research which consisted of both closed and open questions. 143 young people from Sääksjärvi Junior High school and Lempäälä High school were interviewed. This research revealed that young people are quite satisfied with Viking Line as it is at the moment which naturally is a positive outcome to Viking Line. The results also showed that Viking Line is known among youth and they are interested in services provided on Viking Line ferries. However, there are still service areas that need to be improved in order to satisfy young customers. On the basis of the results, these areas were entertainment and music, programmes and activities and shopping possibilities.     The main goal for Viking Line is to answer to the current demands and wishes of young customers. The possibilities of making Viking Line an even more attractive travel destination to young people are achievable. They do not require any major actions and thus, they are easy to do with a few improvement actions.

The aim of this thesis is to provide the commissioner ZEF Ltd. with important points of considera-tion when entering the US market. The subject was agreed with the commissioner to support their business expansion abroad, and the desired results of this thesis will point out certain matters that may have gone unnoticed if it was not for this thesis. The purpose is to help ZEF have a suc-cessful market entry to the US. Mainly online sources were used for the theoretical background in order to ensure up-to-date information and practical approach. To support the knowledge provided by theory, a semi-structured interview covering all the four themes was conducted with Juho Risku, the co-founder and partner at Butterfly Ventures, due to his experience in operating a business in the US. The interview was used together with the theory to form a coherent knowledge base. The results show that ZEF needs to take into account each of the four themes introduced in this thesis. They should consider all the practicalities of establishing an office in a foreign country from entry strategies to market differences. After entering the country, the company needs to consider different ways of networking in order to establish relationships with business partners and cus-tomers. Also, ZEF needs to consider their marketing and sales operations, especially whether to use both inbound and outbound marketing, and whether their product is ready for the market or not. The final consideration is the arrangement of customer support, as customer support locating only in Finland is not going to be sufficient, and ZEF will face the need to recruit more employees in the US. This thesis was conducted when ZEF was not yet operating in the US. Therefore, as the situation and the companys plans may change during their US operations, further research could be done on each of the four themes or the situation as a whole. For example, continuously changing mar-keting methods can bring new research ideas, and the arrangement of customer support will face challenges as the US customer base grows bigger.
