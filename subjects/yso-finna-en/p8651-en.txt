What SEM microstructural analysis tells about the origin of volcanic material and source area history
Studying the distribution of certain elements, present in very low concentrations in igneous and metamorphic rocks, can yield important clues about the rocks' origin and evolution. Trace elements do not give rise to characteristic minerals, but their behaviour can be modelled to provide historical information about the source magma. This book brings together the essential theory required to understand the behaviour of trace elements in magmas and magma-derived rocks. It presents a wide range of models and mechanisms which explain trace element distribution. Trace Elements in Magmas provides an excellent resource for graduate students, petrologists, geochemists and mineralogists, as well as researchers in geophysics and materials science.

Stone crushing activities and delivery of the material can increase air pollution and particle emissions into the air which can have health effects on the residents living around a stone crushing plant. The main purpose of this study is to gather information on the increased level of particle emissions by stone crushing and transportation activities and its health effects on local residents. This report is literature based and presents the information on the crushing activities on particle levels and their possible health effects. There are only few studies concerning the health effects of a stone crushing plant on the residents around it is very limited. Urban air quality is already affected by existing traffic and possible industries around it, the addition of stone crushing project will add up to air pollution problems in urban areas. There are considerable links between the increase of particle emissions and mortality/morbidity rates in urban areas, where the amount of traffic and particle emissions is high. An increase of only 10μg/m3 in PM2.5 can raise cardiovascular mortality about 6%. Elemental carbon (EC) concentration measured by filter sampling seemed to be the best indicator of heavy diesel vehicle traffic pollution. In addition to that diesel, trucks increase also nitrogen dioxide exposure and polluted area in Sääksjärvi example case. Diesel truck related particle level at the transportation route could increase by about 0.12 μg/m3 (270 trucks a day) or by 0.20 μg/m3 (370 trucks a day). Also road dust levels possibly increase due to intense traffic. Recent studies have suggested that also short term exposure to PM10 may increase respiratory symptoms and trigger heart attacks. It was concluded that the addition of dust and particle pollution by stone crushing activities as well as stone material delivery, can have a negative health effect on the residents nearby a stone crushing plant. In order to evaluate the severity and the affecting amounts of pollution, further studies need to be carried out.
