Why won’t my teenager talk to me? draws on ground-breaking research relating to brain development, sleep patterns in adolescence, and communication to offer a valuable tool enabling parents and carers to become more effective and resilient during this stage. Based on the author’s long experience in running workshops for parents of teenagers, the combination of practical advice and research evidence will give readers an invaluable guide to the adolescent stage of life. The book draws on the voices and experiences of a wide range of parents of teenagers. Talking and listening is at the heart of this book. Based on developing strategies for positive and respectful two-way communication, Dr Coleman’s revolutionary "STAGE" framework for parenting offers new insights and helps parents navigate the teenage years. Its aim is to improve relations between parents and teenagers, as well as to help professionals in their work with families. It will appeal to all parents and carers of teenagers, as well as to those in the fields of social work, counselling, health and education.
