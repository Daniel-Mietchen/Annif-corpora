Scanning electrochemical microscopy
The surfaces of seeds from nineteen species of Epilobium in Fennoscandia were investigated with scanning electron microscope. The photographs were taken of seeds at magnifications of approximately 45 or 90 times, respectively, depending on the size of the seed. In addition, photographs of four times higher magnification were taken of the base of each seed, as well as detailed pictures of the seed surface at a magnification of about 560 times. In general, the photographs of the seeds were found to provide sufficient evidence to identify the species..

Immunohistochemistry
"When one looks at a specimen with a light microscope, how does one know what is real and what is an illusion created by the apparatus itself? Light and Video Microscopy takes the reader step by step through philosophy, psychology, and particularly geometrical and physical optics so that the reader can interpret images formed by light microscopes. The reader can then use this knowledge to set up light microscopes that allow one to visualize transparent specimens and, in the process, quantitatively determine physico-chemical properties like the mass of the specimen, the Ca[superscript 2+] concentration or pH of the specimen and structural properties, including the alignment of macromolecules and the localization of genes or proteins in the specimen. The reader also learns how the microscope can be interfaced with a computer to image cells using digital techniques that are able to replace or augment optical techniques. One comes away from reading this book empowered to use past, present, and future microscopical techniques to visualize the microscopic world and find the real nature of life in the image."

Dermoscopy (also known as surface microscopy) is a clinical technique which allows the detailed examination of pigmented skin lesions and which is more accurate diagnostically than other clinical approaches. This well-illustrated, highly acclaimed reference (previously titled An Atlas of Surface Microscopy of Pigmented Skin Lesions) is one of the first to document this pioneering technique and provide a complete understanding of the use of dermoscopy. It explains the diagnostic features and examines benign, melanocytic, melanoma and non-melanocytic pigmented lesions...Features...Quality reproduction and images from the world's biggest melanoma database. Addition of more than 200 illustrations and shape recognition for increased conceptual understanding.
