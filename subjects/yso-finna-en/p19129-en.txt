"This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of geochemistry. The book first lays out the 'geochemical toolbox': the basic principles and techniques of modern geochemistry, beginning with a review of thermodynamics and kinetics as they apply to the Earth and its environs. These basic concepts are then applied to understanding processes in aqueous systems and the behavior of trace elements in magmatic systems. Subsequent chapters introduce radiogenic and stable isotope geochemistry and illustrate their application to such diverse topics as determining geologic time, ancient climates, and the diets of prehistoric peoples. The focus then broadens to the formation of the solar system, the Earth, and the elements themselves. Then the composition of the Earth itself becomes the topic, examining the composition of the core, the mantle, and the crust and exploring how this structure originated. A final chapter covers organic chemistry, including the origin of fossil fuels and the carbon cycle's role in controlling Earth's climate, both in the geologic past and the rapidly changing present.Geochemistry is essential reading for all earth science students, as well as for researchers and applied scientists who require an introduction to the essential theory of geochemistry, and a survey of its applications in the earth and environmental sciences.Additional resources can be found at: www.wiley.com/go/white/geochemistry "--

"This is the first comprehensive text on the theory and practice of aquatic organic matter fluorescence analysis, written by the experts who pioneered the research area. This book covers the topic in the broadest possible terms, providing a common reference for making measurements that are comparable across disciplines, and allowing consistent interpretation of data and results. The book includes the fundamental physics and chemistry of organic matter fluorescence, as well as the effects of environmental factors. All aspects of sample handling, data processing, and the operation of both field and laboratory instrumentation are included, providing the practical advice required for successful fluorescence analyses. Advanced methods for data interpretation and modeling, including parallel factor analysis, are also discussed. The book will interest those establishing field, laboratory, or industrial applications of fluorescence, including advanced students and researchers in environmental chemistry, marine science, environmental geosciences, environmental engineering, soil science, and physical geography"--

The purpose of this research project was to study the annual cycle of basic water properties in a lake covered by ice for about half the year close to the Arctic Circle. Samples were collected from the water column of the lake and the outlets of inflowing rivers with a Ruttner sampler from twelve locations during six visits in 1996-1997, a total of 31 samples each time. The analyses were made in accordance with the Finnish standards and included determinations of organic solids, alkalinity, colour, conductivity, total phosphorus (totP), total nitrogen (totN), ammonia (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3&minus;). Lake Paanajärvi is an east-west oriented tectonic lake (width 0.6-1.3 km, length 24.5 km, max. depth 128 m) surrounded by carbonate rich rocks and taiga forests. With over nine-tenths of the lake inflow into the western end and the outlet at the opposite eastern end of the lake, the topmost water layers of the lake behave much like a through-flow river. Most of these waters come from Finland and have been affected by human activity while all other inflowing waters drain from natural conditions.Seasonally, the winter time is characterized by the lowest of all colour values, the highest of all alkalinity contents, and by settling of phosphorus. All these features are mainly due to minimal discharges, high proportion of groundwater flow in relation to surface flow and calm conditions thanks to the ice-cover. Spring-time starts with violent nival floods in May associated with the maximal colour values, minimal alkalinity contents, and the rise of the spring turnover, temperature stratification and biotic activity which proceed in a wave-like fashion through the lake controlled by the through-flow and warming of river waters entering into the western inlet end of the lake. The uptake of nutrients is best seen in a rapid decrease of nitrate in the epilimnion in association with the increase of ammonia as a result of metabolism of organisms. The autumn turnover in late September and early October is associated with close to equal values of all parameters in the whole water column of the lake. The exhaustion of nitrate in the epilimnion suggests that nitrate may be a limiting factor for the biotic life. Other typical features of the lake are the lower temperatures and nutrient levels in the outlet deep compared to the inlet deep of the lake, and this may have led to adaptation and specialization among the biota within this "mini-Baikal" by Fennoscandian standards.
