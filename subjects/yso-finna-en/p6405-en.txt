"Building Transnational Networks tells the story of how a broad group of civil society organizations came together to contest free trade negotiations in the Americas. Based on research in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the United States, and Canada, it offers a full hemispheric analysis of the creation of civil society networks as they engaged in the politics of trade. The author demonstrates that most effective transnational actors are the ones with strong domestic roots and that 'southern' organizations occupy key nodes in trade networks. The fragility of activist networks stems from changes in the domestic political context as well as from characteristics of the organizations, the networks, or the actions they undertake. These findings advance and suggest new understandings of transnational collective action"--

"Based on an in-depth examination of Mexico's print and broadcast media over the last twenty-five years, this book is the most richly detailed account available of the role of the media in democratization, demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between changes in the press and changes in the political system. In addition to illuminating the nature of political change in Mexico, this accessibly written study also has broad implications for understanding the role of the mass media in democratization around the world." --Publisher's description.

Partnership in civil society : a case of building trust between non-profit associations and international NGOs in Lao PDR
"Beginning in the 1980s, sub-Saharan Africa witnessed a veritable explosion of NGOs and CSOs engaged in efforts to develop the subcontinent. Often praised for their commitment, flexibility, close contact with grassroots movements and marginalized groups, these organizations have become the darlings of donors and the UN system. During the same period, however, rural Africa has sunk deeper into poverty. The massive NGO engagement appears not to have made any meaningful progress." "Snakes in Paradise breaks through the generalizations and neat theories to discover why these efforts have failed. Focusing especially on those local NGOs that are frequently overlooked by studies that cover the major international players, Holmen uncovers a NGO landscape that is considerably more ambiguous than the popular development literature would have people believe."--BOOK JACKET.

"For all of the attention that has been paid to social organizations - and the research conducted on them - our understanding has still been significantly limited by the persistent assumptions surrounding the effect of NGO emergence, the internal orientation of the organizations, and the relations they have with states. In the West, we have been conditioned to see the rise of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in fairly stark, axiomatic terms. The presence of NGOs is thought to be an important indicator of civil society development. And with a robust civil society, political change is thought to soon follow. Part of the logic at work is that NGOs and civil society are frequently seen to hold governments accountable. In authoritarian contexts, where the government is not accountable to its citizenry (at least in an electoral sense), we presume these accountability-seeking organizations to be oppositional to the state. Any reasonable observer would then assume, given their druthers, an authoritarian government would not allow such oppositional groups to exist at all. Perhaps then it makes sense to first assume that NGOs would not exist in a place like China at all. And to the extent that they do appear in the country, we might best assume these organizations to not be authentic 'real' NGOs. This would, of course, be one way of explaining why the political change that many expect to come from the emergence of NGOs has not occurred in China. But it would not be a satisfying explanation"--

"Through the efforts of increasingly media-aware NGOs, people in the west are bombarded with images of poverty and inequality in the developing world. Representations of Poverty is the first comprehensive study of the communications and imagery used by international NGOs to represent the developing world. In this meticulously researched and original book, Nandita Dogra examines the full cycle of representation - integrating analyses of the public messages of international development NGOs in the UK with the views of their staff and audiences. Exploring the Europeanised discourses inherent in appeals to this notion of a 'common humanity', she argues for a greater acknowledgment of NGOs as significant mediating institutions which can expand understandings of global inequalities and their historical causation. The book is a timely addition to the growing fields of development and media studies and will be a key resource for academics, policymakers and practitioners alike who have an interest in global poverty, aid, NGOs, and the politics of representation." --Provided by publisher.

SOID - A local NGO supporting the well-being of orphans
"This book is an authoritative and radical manifesto for urgently needed changes in development cooperation. It proposes that, unless radical steps are taken by the World Bank, the first decade of the century will witness an ever-widening gulf between the poor and rich countries. A Chance for the World Bank provides an overview of the challenges faced by the World Bank, and explores how it has organized itself to deal with its mission. This book proposes that the World Bank still has a chance to achieve its stated goals; in order to do so, it needs to take a number of radical steps: to create a level playing field in trade for the developing countries; to harmonize aid and save developing countries from the gigantic transaction costs of aid; and to promote governance in developing countries and to reduce rigorously induced corruption by multinationals."--Kirjan takakansi.

Copenhagen Climate Conference that was arranged by the United Nations was held in December 2009. It gathered 192 nations together to negotiate a climate treaty to stop dangerous climate change that threatens all of us. The purpose of the conference was to get a successor to the Kyoto Protocol that had set binding greenhouse gas reduction targets for the industrialized countries to follow. The conference ended up with a big disappointment. It resulted in a non-binding Copenhagen Accord, which only a handful of parties had negotiated in the last minute. Non-governmental organizations had worked hard to get a proper deal that was not met at the end.  A lot of their work went behind the scenes trying to influence the ministers and decision-makers with their expert advice. Their work also involved raising the awareness of the public, ministers and media by many different ways. One of them included side-events, which ranged from presentations to exhibitions to marches and protests. The aim of the thesis is to tell how environmental non-governmental organizations prepared for the Copenhagen Climate Conference. It wants to shed some light into the work behind the scenes of the event. Also, the work of the environmental non-governmental organizations to fight climate change in general is handled. The thesis involved searching and gathering relevant information from several sources. It also involved interviewing some experts in the field and conducting a survey that was sent to several environmental non-governmental organizations in Europe, which took part in the Copenhagen Climate Conference.  The survey gives you an idea of the work that the organizations did for the event.

"Why do advocacy campaigns succeed in some cases but fail in others? What conditions motivate states to accept commitments championed by principled advocacy movements? Joshua W. Busby sheds light on these core questions through an investigation of four cases - developing country debt relief, climate change, AIDS, and the International Criminal Court - in the G-7 advanced industrialized countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Drawing on hundreds of interviews with policy practitioners, he employs qualitative, comparative case study methods, including process-tracing and typologies, and develops a framing/gatekeepers argument, emphasizing the ways in which advocacy campaigns use rhetoric to tap into the main cultural currents in the countries where they operate. Busby argues that when values and costs potentially pull in opposing directions, values will win if domestic gatekeepers who are able to block policy change believe that the values at stake are sufficiently important"--
