The purpose of this Master's thesis was to improve a technology oriented mobile network performance monitoring towards a service oriented model, and study the fundamental mobile network characteristics affecting the mobile network performance reporting. This Master's thesis introduces relations between mobile network architecture, radio network structure and mobile network Performance Management. The Six Sigma methodology is introduced on a general level, and common statistics to monitor a process are presented. The research work for this Master's thesis was carried out inside the Author's Six Sigma Black Belt project to renew the Mobile Network Performance Quality Team Report. The Six Sigma DMAIC process was used to reach the results. The scope of the thesis was limited to speech telephone service and the primary measure for the analysis was the KPI call success.The DMAIC process Measure phase result was a new service oriented report structure which associates the technological KPI sets with the services critical to characteristics. There were two main results from the DMAIC process Analyze phase. The first Analyze phase result was the most critical input factors for the KPI call success. The mobile network's fundamental characteristics found were the populations Rural and Urban and the traffic share between them, which explains the long term variation in the statistically significant sense. The second Analyze phase result was the found root cause for the large short term variation. The formula of the used KPI call success itself was the root cause indicating lower performance for the days with a higher average call duration.The common finding of the long term and short term analysis was that the customer behaviour is a statistically significant factor for mobile network performance monitoring in the scope of traffic movements between the populations and call duration changes. The importance of customer behavioural factors increases if the KPI measures are used to compare the performance of mobile networks from different markets when such customer behaviour difference might occur.

This thesis is targeting to develop and engineer a burglar alarm system prototype using the software and hardware environment Arduino, which is originally manufactured by Smart Projects. The system under development provides a versatile theft inhibition hardware configuration for the holder of the system. It also provides vehicle localization enabling features in case of theft. In the final project, the aim is not to reach commercial benefit. The aim is to get familiar with software libraries and information offered by Arduino environment, GPS utilizing standard NMEA0183 and SIM900 with AT commands. This project examines burglar alarm system engineering from a commercially neutral point of view. Most of the sources have been published by companies, but without these essential resources it would be extremely complicated to engineer the software. In process of this final project, the functional requirements and hardware are defined. Then the embedded software is implemented. Finally, the achievements are explored and the final outcome is discussed. With the available resources for the project, it was feasible to create a project plan. The project plan describes how the burglar alarm system should work. A partial software was engineered and it was ready to use few AT commands. Also, the hardware design was put together. The GSM/GPRS Quadband module was assembled into the Arduino Mega 2560, and an anti-theft immobilizer relay was soldered into a circuit board. The PIR-sensor was acquired and connected to the Arduino Mega 2560.
