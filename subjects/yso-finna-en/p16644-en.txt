The goal of this thesis was to develop a test method to determine the barrier properties of polymer substrates for Picodeon Ltd Oy. Picodeon had earlier made tests at 3rd party laboratories to determine barrier properties; the in-house test was developed to accelerate the development work of barrier films. The oil penetration test followed the guidelines of ASTM F119 – 82 standard. In this project the goal was to find the right test parameters for tensioned TPU membrane and to develop the analysis of the results. The gas penetration test was designed to be a fast way to determine the barrier properties of polymer samples and to show improvements on the coating related to porous structure. In this method helium gas was used and detector was Agilent G3388A leak detector. For oil penetration test the right parameters were found and a picture analysis method was developed where the mean gray value of spots from TLC plate was measured. With mean gray value method we were able to follow the progress of penetration through polymer. A specification for oil penetration test was done (Appendix 1). Gas penetration test with Agilent detector was abandoned after first set of tests because the detectors quantitative values and the lack of sensitivity. A new setup for gas penetration was acquired but time ran out to do any testing with the new setup.

The aim of this thesis was to prepare polyelectrolyte thin films by spin coating and to determine the surface free energy of the films. The surface free energy was calculated by means of contact angle measurements. The studied polyelectrolytes have applications such as organic solar cells and organic light emitting diodes. Surface free energy is related to the integrity of the thin film laminate structures used in various applications. Thin films were prepared on a glass substrate whose surface was activated by plasma treatment followed by a spin coating procedure. Thin films were prepared of four different polyelectrolytes (PIMa, PIMb, PT1 and PT2), each in two different dissolutions: water and water-dioxane (50:50 v:v). The films were thermally annealed before the contact angle measurements. For contact angle measurement, four different probe liquids were used, namely glycerol, formamide, ethylene glycol, and diiodomethane. Surface free energy and its polar and dispersive components were calculated based on the contact angle measurements. Glass slides without any polymer film, treated with water and water-dioxane, were used as blanks. Thin film height profile was measured by atomic force microscopy after scratching the surface. The obtained results show that methods for surface free energy determination by contact angle measurement are not standardized and there are several details to consider for successful measurement.
