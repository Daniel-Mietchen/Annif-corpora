"In a provocative, groundbreaking work, National Magazine Award&#173;-finalist Rebecca Traister, "the most brilliant voice on feminism in this country" (Anne Lamott), traces the history of unmarried women in America who, through social, political, and economic means, have radically shaped our nation.  For legions of women, living single isn't news; it's life.  In 2009, the award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies--a book she thought would be a work of contemporary journalism--about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman. It was the year the proportion of American women who were married dropped below fifty percent; and the median age of first marriages, which had remained between twenty and twenty-two years old for nearly a century (1890-1980), had risen dramatically to twenty-seven.  But over the course of her vast research and more than a hundred interviews with academics and social scientists and prominent single women, Traister discovered a startling truth: the phenomenon of the single woman in America is not a new one. And historically, when women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, the results were massive social change--temperance, abolition, secondary education, and more.  Today, only twenty percent of Americans are wed by age twenty-nine, compared to nearly sixty percent in 1960. The Population Reference Bureau calls it a "dramatic reversal." All the Single Ladies is a remarkable portrait of contemporary American life and how we got here, through the lens of the single American woman. Covering class, race, sexual orientation, and filled with vivid anecdotes from fascinating contemporary and historical figures, All the Single Ladies is destined to be a classic work of social history and journalism. Exhaustively researched, brilliantly balanced, and told with Traister's signature wit and insight, this book should be shelved alongside Gail Collins's When Everything

The environment in contexts : environmental concern in the Komi Republic (Russia)
Service quality has become one of the most researched subjects within service marketing however, in spite of the substantial amount of research done; students are left with little attention. Students as a consumer group have increasingly started to travel and they have more disposable income than previously, making them a significant target group for tour operators, with potential for profitable activity. The aim of this study is to gain an insight into how students perceive tour operators' service quality. This was studied by generating three research issues, which were derived from the hierarchical model developed in chapter 2, literature review. The objectives of this study are to clarify prior research in the field and to develop a framework for research, to develop and justify the appropriate research methodology for collecting primary data and to display and analyse primary data, and to reach conclusions about them. This research was done qualitatively by conducting totally ten in-depth interviews. Three were done of each tour operator and one extra of Aurinkomatkat. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded before analysis. A case analysis was conducted of each tour operator separately, followed by cross case analyses covering all research issues. The analysis showed that the conceptual model does not apply to this specific study and therefore a descriptive framework is presented.  In the descriptive framework the three levels of hierarchy are maintained, but the dimensions in them change as their perceived importance varied from the anticipated one. On the first level of hierarchy, the most important ones are interaction and value for money and time, and on the second level, the sub-dimensions are the environment, waiting time and tangibles together with the internet. The most important determinant was however the interaction, which after being perceived as good or acceptable, allowed the other dimensions to have their impact on service quality as a whole.

"The first edition of InterViews provided students and professionals in a wide variety of disciplines with the "whys" and "hows" of research interviewing, preparing students for learning interviewing by doing interviews and by studying examples of best practice. The thoroughly revised Second Edition retains its original seven stage structure, continuing to focus on the practical, epistemological, and ethical issues involved with interviewing. Authors Steinar Kvale and Svend Brinkmann also include coverage of newer developments in qualitative interviewing, discussion of interviewing as a craft, and a new chapter on linguistic modes of interview analysis. Practical and conceptual assignments, as well as new "tool boxes," provide students with the means to dig deeper into the material presented and achieve a more meaningful level of understanding." "This text is ideal for both novice and experienced interview researchers as well as graduate students taking courses in qualitative and research methods in the social sciences and health sciences, particularly in departments of education, nursing, sociology, psychology, and the media sciences."--Jacket.

"Twins Talk is an ethnographic study of identical twins in the United States, a study unique in that it considers what twins have to say about themselves, instead of what researchers have written about them. It presents, in the first person, the grounded and practical experiences of twins as they engage, both individually and together, the "who am I" and "who are we" questions of life. Here, the twins themselves are the stars. Dona Lee Davis conducted conversational interviews with twenty-two sets of identical twins attending the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, the largest such gathering in the world. Lively and often opinionated, each twin comes through as a whole person who at the same time maintains a special bond that the vast majority of people will never experience. The study provides a distinctive and enlightening insider's challenge to the nature/nurture debates that dominate contemporary research on twins. The author, herself an identical twin, draws on aspects of her own life to inform her analysis of the data throughout the text. Each chapter addresses a different theme from multiple viewpoints, including those of popular science writers, scientific researchers, and singletons, as well as those of the twins themselves"--

There are an increasing number of Russian students studying abroad and this number continues to grow. The primary aim of this qualitative research was to find out ways to attract potential Russian students into Tampere University of Applied Sciences.  The research was conducted through the personal interviews with current Russian students of TAMK and using benchmarking methods. The personal interview was designed as depth interview and respondents were asked individually. The questions which were asked included the student's reasons for choosing Finland and particularly TAMK. Also they were asked about the role of their parents, previous education and possible ways of marketing. Overall interview results showed that TAMK has good reputation and Tampere is an attractive city to live and study among the students. Parents are playing a major role in education of Russian students and this why marketing should be concentrated also on them. The Finnish free education is naturally attractive for potential students. When applicant choosing place to study she/he takes into account multiple factors such as living costs, reputation of the city and institution. The results of research could be used as a framework for marketing purposes in order to attract more potential Russian degree students into TAMK international degree programmes. The developing proposal could help TAMK's marketing department to better understand Russian applicants' needs and improve its international activities. The A4- size marketing broachers in the Russian language about TAMK's Bachelor's degree programmes conducted in English were created. These brochures could be used in education fairs which are held in Russia.
