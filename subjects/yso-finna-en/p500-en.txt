Genetic analysis of foal and studbook traits in selection for racing performance in trotters
Nutrition of the exercising horse
This book describes recent developments in nutrition and training in sports horses. Special attention is given to the equine musculoskeletal system with a focus on tendons, a tissue frequently injured in sports horses. Experts in the field of exercise and medical sciences - working both with equine and human athletes - provide reviews on how to improve training and rehabilitation of tendons. Interrelated topics, such as riding balance, oxidative stress, welfare, exercise physiology and boot design are also covered in the book. The book will be of interest to anyone working in the field of equine sport and veterinary science.
