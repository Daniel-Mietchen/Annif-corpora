This bachelor thesis includes two parts: artistic and written. The artistic part of this thesis was a solo concert, which was held on March 16, 2011 at Sigyn-hall, Turku, Finland. The concert is a main part of this thesis. The purpose of the concert was to experience my organizational skills and to challenge myself as a solo-violinist and chamber musician. The concert program included pieces of five different genres. In the second part of the concer was a piano quintet by Shostakovich. In addition to me, in the concert were playing also following instrumentalists: Eri Itoh (violin), Inka Heilim√∂ (viola), Anni Manninen (cello) and Mikael Kemppainen (piano). The concert poster, program and CD are attached in the end of this thesis. The written part of this thesis deals with performing practice and particularly, the problem of anxiety (fear) on the stage. The main emphasis in the written part of thesis is given to identify the reasons of musician's anxiety which exposes many of our mistakes and shortcomings. My purpose is to define helping means to handle it.

In Facing the Fear - the first book of its kind written specifically for actors - performer, author and teacher Bella Merlin draws on her own and other actors' personal experiences to examine: The internal and external roots of stage fright, and how it manifests itself both psychologically and physiologically, The complex relationship between the actor and the audience, and how it contributes to stage fright, The cognitive processes of learning, storing and retrieving lines, and practical strategies to help, The essential principles for building a healthy, fear-free rehearsal environment, The techniques that actors can employ to develop their own practices, from tips on physical wellbeing to performance strategies. Insightful, empowering and always reassuring, Facing the Fear is a book for any actor: for those who are experiencing or have previously suffered from stage fright, as well as for those who want to be fully prepared in case that day ever comes. It provides all the tools actors need to understand, confront and ultimately overcome stage fright and its effects, thereby regaining control over their lives and careers. (And it might just save a fortune in psychotherapist's fees!) It's also valuable reading for any teacher, director or stage manager working closely with actors, and a fascinating insight for anyone interested in what actors go through.
