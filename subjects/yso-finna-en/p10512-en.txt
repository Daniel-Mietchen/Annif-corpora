In information systems (IS) research, there is increasing interest in understanding complex and large-scale efforts. This study examines the complexity involved in infrastructuring within a novel context: the educational network of a Finnish city. A unique aspect is this study’s focus on children’s participation in infrastructuring. It contributes to the existing body of literature by addressing the concepts of discourses in place, interaction order, and historical body, as drawn from nexus analysis. It offers these concepts as theoretical tools for understanding the complexity of infrastructuring, and furthers exploration of user participation in IS research through a careful analysis of actor participation in the infrastructuring venture in question. The findings of this study foreground a multitude of actors, both adults and children, as well as their various activities and the versatility of the involved objects of design. The central social actors include educational officials, schools (teachers, headmasters, and pupils), researchers, and local and global companies.Infrastructuring in this research includes planned activities concerning developed solutions, but also emergent activities for adapting planned solutions to local schools’ everyday practices, revealing the intimate intertwining of practices and technologies. In particular, the past temporal horizon and shared histories of the communities involved are highlighted in terms of the concept of the historical body. The analysis on the historical bodies of the actors foregrounded the local aspects that were appreciated, but also challenged in infrastructuring. The concept of interaction order was found to be useful for analyzing the heterogeneity, multivoicedness, tensions between local and global dimensions, and power aspects inherent in infrastructuring As a practical implication, the nexus analytic conce pts of historical body and interaction order are suggested as means of better understanding local settings and the power relationships of various actors, and are also useful for practitioners preparing for infrastructuring.
