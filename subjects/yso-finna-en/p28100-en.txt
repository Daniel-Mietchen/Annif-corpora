The Deaf way II reader : perspectives from the second international conference on deaf culture
Are Deaf people equal before the law? Do they have equal access to the justice system? These questions are exploired in this book which draws upon the work of a major research project, 'Access to Justice for Deaf People in the Bilingual, Bimodal Courtroom'. This project was carried out by a research team at the University of Durham. For three years researchers observed a wide range of court cases in which Deaf people were involved as defendants or accused, witnesses or victims. Some court proceedings were video-taped, but the research team also carried out in-depth interviews with Deaf people and interpreters, as well as conducting a survey among interpreters.

These findings from the Durham University research project which observed court cases involving Deaf people over three years, and carried out in-depth interviews with Deaf people and Interpreters, reveal that sign language court interpreters are often not qualified interpreters, or have had no specialist legal interpreting training. The highly skilled task is often poorly understood by other participants in court proceedings, and the difference between BSL and English imposes particular constraints and demands on the interpreter.
