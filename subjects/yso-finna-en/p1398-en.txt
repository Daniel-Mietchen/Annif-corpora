Textiles are a key component of the industrial, industrious and consumer revolutions, which are seen as transforming the economy, society and culture of Western Europe during the long eighteenth century. Yet we lack a coherent picture of how the marketing of textiles varied across time and between different regions and countries. This book provides important new insights into the ways in which changes in the supply of textiles related to shifting patterns of demand, not just in terms of imported novelties such as chintz, but also more traditional, locally-produced and even second-hand textiles. It focuses on the processes and practices of retailing, and assesses how these responded to and promoted wider changes in value systems and supply networks. It encompasses discussion of fashion and taste, advertising and pricing, cultural norms and local tradition, cleanliness and hygiene, shopkeepers and stock.

Abstract: This thesis addresses buyer-supplier relationships and identification of drivers that  initiate the development of such relationships. The main purpose of this thesis is  to provide guidelines that assist companies in the process of determining the  drivers for relationship development.  The focus of the theoretical part of this thesis is on buyer-supplier relationships  and especially on identifying and defining the drivers of relationship development.  In addition purchasing as a part of supply chain management is briefly introduced  to distinguish the context for the theoretical part.  The empirical part of this thesis consists of the demonstration of the process of  determining drivers for relationship development. It is based on desk and field  research. Desk research consists of combining various sources to generate an  assessment form which is utilized in determining the drivers. Field research is  conducted by applying the generated form to the case company followed by  interviews with the company's representative.  In this thesis critical strategic factors, relationship strength indicators and potential  benefits were identified as the aspects of the drivers of relationship development.  The generated assessment form proved to be a competent tool in assessing the first  two aspects of the drivers. The form also contributes to the evaluation of the third  aspect, potential benefits, since this evaluation is largely derived from the  assessment of the first two.  As a result of the research moderate yet conscious strengthening of the  relationship towards more cooperative approach was recommended to the case  company. In addition the empirical part of this thesis provided guidelines that  assist especially small and medium size enterprises in assessing the  appropriateness of developing their buyer-supplier relationships. However the  conducted research focused strictly on the initial stage of buyer-supplier  relationship development and as such leaves opportunities and provides a basis for  further research on the subject.

Mass persuasion : the social psychology of a war bond drive
"This volume brings together research on retailing and shopping and their embeddedness in urban space, themes that have attracted wide interest in recent decades. Addressing these themes over an era that bridges the early modern and modern period, the authors argue that the 'modernity' of the nineteenth century is often overemphasised, at the expense of recognising the continuities with the earlier period and the degree of innovation that took place before the onset of 'modernity'. This collection compares long-term developments in retail locations, retailing formats, regulation of shopping streets, and the cult of shopping for pleasure across a number of neighbouring countries and regions (Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands), and offers surprising new insights into the processes of cultural transfer, appropriation and exchange.
