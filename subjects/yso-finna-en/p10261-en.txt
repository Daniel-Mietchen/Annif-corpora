This text covers topics that deal with the chemistry of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the terrestrial environment. It emphasises the chemical principles which apply to environmental studies, and includes a broad range of examples and exercises.
The hydrologic cycle in the atmosphere
Environmental chemistry : a global perspective
The theory of the Earth's climate evolution based on universal chemical-physical laws of matter-energy transformation is presented in the book. It shows how the process of Earth's core separation has led to formation and evolution of the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Having analyzed the processes of heat transfer in the atmosphere, the writers developed the adiabatic theory of the greenhouse effect, which was applied for analysis of climatic changes on the Earth. The influence of changes in climate on formation of mineral deposits and development of life on Earth was considered and presented based on modeling of typical climatic regimes. It shows that the anthropogenic effect on the Earth's global temperature is negligible in comparison with the effect of global forces of nature. * Presents the theory of Earth's evolution based on the laws of chemical-density differentiation of the origin of the Earth * Discusses the adiabatic theory of the greenhouse effect with quantitative estimates of the natural and anthropogenic influences on Earth's climates * Describes the quantitative description of the evolution of the Earth's climate throughout geologic history and prediction of the future of the Earth's climate * Investigates the global forces of nature driving the.
