Project management is characterised by systematic and integral control of the development process, from creative idea to concrete product. This book concentrates on the management of event projects. Events such as festivals, exhibitions, conferences, arts productions, sports events and company events draw a lot of attention. An initiative frequently ends in failure, because the funding cannot be finalised, deadlines are not met or budgets are exceeded. The professional approach of a project can prevent many problems. The Project Management method is very user-friendly and stands out by its direct applicability(numerous check lists, step-by-step plans and model contracts). This book describes a concept of project management for general application, and the organisational, financial and planning aspects of a project. This third edition has been adapted regarding both the contents and the form that were altered in the Dutch version of the book Projectmanagement, the 8th edition by Jan Verhaar. Besides the obvious changes for this 3rd edition small changes and add-ons have been made throughout the entire book. In Part A, the chapters have been included which guide you through the methodology. In Part B you will learn using the step-by-step plan, with your own event or conference project. In Part C all of the chapters have been bundled together so that you can gain theoretical insight into the different techniques and models.

Planning and staging the backstage area as an integral part of event production and management on temporary venues
The subject of this thesis was to arrange a welfare day in the school of Business and Information Management. The two development tasks were to give information on how to promote personal wellbeing and to organize a successful event, which marketing communications meet the target group. Two target groups were defined for the event. The first target group was the students of the School of Business and Information Management and the second target group was the staff. The main theme for the event consisted of three areas of wellbeing: physical, social and mental. Erja Korhonen, leader of the student welfare team in the School of Business and Information Management, assigned the thesis. The student welfare team was working in the background of this thesis. The thesis consists of discussion in physical, social and mental wellbeing. The theoretical foundation includes physical, mental and social wellbeing, event project organizing, project planning, executing, evaluating and terminating. Event marketing is also included in the theoretical foundation by being a part of project planning. In addition to the theoretical foundation, chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 also review how this event was put into action. The feedback was gathered by using a simple feedback form with three questions. 90 filled feedback forms were returned. 86 of the participants had gotten at least some ideas on how to promote their personal wellbeing. 67 participants thought that the event content was comprehensive enough and only three did not think so. The internal information channel Oiva reached most of the students that participated the event. According to the feedback, the welfare day event was successful and both of the development tasks were completed. This welfare day event was the first to be organized in the spring and it turned out to be a good time for a refreshing event like this. Most of the stands had activities to take part in, which made them more interesting. Free samples and raffle prizes by the sponsors Valio, SATS, Neste Oil and Manninen Nutraceuticals gave extra value to the event. Where to locate the stands gives something to think about. If the stands should be located around the school, little signposts would help the participants to find them easily. This thesis report can be exploited when working on a new welfare day event.

Live entertainment is currently one of the few vital components of the music industry as it struggles to survive in the XXI century and conform to the drastic changes on the music market. Music events occur in great amount on a daily basis and it is important to plan and produce them in the right manner in order to stay relevant and secure one's place on the market. This report introduces various crucial matters that require attention during event organization process, such as marketing and strategic planning, communication and promotion, risk management, event programming and capacity management, to name a few. The 5-phase project management model is applied as the base on which this thesis is built. The research is conducted by comparing the theoretical and practical approach used in the music event business. The practical approach is based on examinations and interviews with the world market leader in live entertainment â€“ Live Nation. An additional analysis of practices used in other large and successful music events in Europe and USA is also conducted. As this thesis shows, the practical approach is often easier and less rigorous than the theory. Some of the steps in this process may be simply omitted due to being considered of little relevance by the management team, many other are outsourced to professional agencies depending on requirements (security, catering). It becomes evident how important it is to be innovative and always stay up to date with the state of the market in order to organize the most successful events.
"Events are becoming more complex as their range of functions grows, as: meeting places, creative spaces, economic catalysts, social drivers, community, image makers, business forums, and network nodes. Effective design can produce more successful business models that can help to sustain cultural and sporting activities even in difficult economic times. This process requires creative imagination, and a design methodology or in other words 'Imagineering'. This book brings together a wide range of international experts in the fields of events, design and Imagineering to examine the event design process. It explores the entire event experience from conception and production to consumption and co-creation. By doing so it offers insight into effective strategies for coping with the shift in value creation away from transactional economic value towards social and relational value which benefit a range of stakeholders from the community to policy makers. Mega-events, small community events, business events and festivals in eight different countries are examined providing an international view of social issues in event design. A wide selection of current research perspectives are employed, integrating both theoretical and applied contributions. The multidisciplinary nature of the material means that it will appeal to a broad academic audience, such as art and design, cultural studies, tourism, events studies, sociology and hospitality"--

The recent proliferation of events as a subject of study in its own right has signalled the emergence of a new field â€“ event studies. However, whilst the management-inspired notion of planned events, which strives for conceptual slenderness, may indeed be useful for event managers, the moment we attempt to advance knowledge about events as social, cultural and political phenomena, we realise the extent to which the field is theoretically impoverished. Event studies, it is argued, must transcend overt business-like perspectives in order to grasp events in their complexities. This book challenges the reader to reach beyond the established modes of thinking about events by placing them against a backdrop of much wider, critical discourse. Approaches and Methods in Event Studies emerges as a conceptual and methodological tour de forceâ€”comprising the works of scholars of diverse backgrounds coming together to address a range of philosophical, theoretical, and methods-related problems. The areas covered include the concepts of eventification and eventual approaches to events, a mobilities paradigm, rhizomatic events, critical discourse analysis, visual methods, reflexive and ethnographic research into events, and indigenous acumen. Researchers and students engaged in the study of events will draw much inspiration from the contributions and from the volume as a whole.
