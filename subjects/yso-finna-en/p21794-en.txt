"Upcycling is the process of transforming seemingly low-value objects into something desirable. Born out of this concept, Upcyclist selects designers and makers who have the imagination and skill to turn waste into exceptionally beautiful creations. From elegant chandeliers crafted from bicycle chains to handwoven rugs made from discarded clothing, these reincarnated works, in contrast to items that are new and mass-produced, preserve the essence of their previous lives whilst being entirely fresh and contemporary."

In her latest jewelry book, Linda Peterson presents 35 stunning metalwork designs for necklaces, rings, bangles, earrings and more. Discover how to create easy pieces from using common materials found in your home and then move on to more advanced techniques with brass, copper and silver. These designs are inspired by the steampunk movement, a style that combines technology and romance - in essence, punk with a Victoriana feel. Think vintage watches, capturing the theme of time travel, combined with brass, copper, leather scraps and faded paper, for unusual jewelry that is elegant yet quirky. Each project has clear step-by-step photography to guide you, and a full techniques section explains all you need to know about working with metal, from hammering to metal texturing and finishing techniques, such as adding a patina to create an aged effect.

This study will discuss the recycling behaviour among students who live in student residences provided by the University of Abertay Dundee (UAD) in the city of Dundee, Scotland. Background to the topic is introduced with facts about the waste management procedures in Europe and in Scotland and the issues that arise from waste in order to explain the reader why this particular subject was thought to be important and thus why it was chosen. The questionnaire used in the survey will also be introduced as well as its design and the questions, in order to explain what exactly was wanted from the questionnaire. The relationship between habits in the past and future behaviour is observed, as well as the correlation between attitudes and intentions. The results and analysis from the questionnaire are discussed later on in the Results and Analysis section. Suggestions to future actions are also introduced as well as the conclusions.

This thesis is the result of co-operation between Fastpap Oy, RÃ¤pina Paberivabrik AS and Tampere University of Applied Sciences. Work originated from Fastpap Oy and the target of this thesis work was to gain knowledge from the mill and the product in order to take the efficiency of the machine even further. Fastpap had delivered a comprehensive rebuild on the wet end of the machine. The results were good but the targeted production rate was not achieved. The old dryer section could not cope with the new capacity of the wet end. This thesis aims to collect all the information that helps to improve the efficiency of the dryer section. Couple of studies were already made to assess the current state of the machine. This work is a summary of those studies already made incorporating further machine concept and properties of the paperboard affecting to the drying efficiency.  The theoretical part of this thesis includes the operation principles of the conventional wire section. This was made to explain the origins of the two sidedness of the product. The drying section concept point of view was also included since the possible bottlenecks of the process would locate on this particular section. The experimental section of this thesis covered the analysis of the product. This analysis gave a vital information of the product to understand the drying process. Besides testing the basic properties of the paperboard, the air permeance and absorbency of the product were examined. Experimental drying simulation were also carried out. The results of the earlier studies from the machine concept point of view were included to gain comprehensive view from the process of this particular machine.  The results of the product analysis did not reveal any severe signs of the two sidedness of the paperweb affecting the drying process. Excluding the surface roughness of the paperboard, the results were quite uniform on the top and the wire side of the product. Some possible improvements on the machine concept point of view were discovered. Most of these discovered points of improvements were already covered in a way or another in the earlier studies. In addition, the assumed originating factors of these detected points were considered. This thesis gives a comprehensive idea of the operating process and the paperboard produced on site. These extensive results can be used as a tool for estimating the possible investments in the mill.
