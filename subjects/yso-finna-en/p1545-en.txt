hunting cultures
Stephen Leonard set off on a journey to document the language and spoken traditions of a small group of Inuit living in a remote corner of north-west Greenland - the Inugguit (the "big people"), who speak a complex language understood by few outsiders. Leonard lived with the Inugguit for 12 months, learning their language and living their way of life, where the traditional is juxtaposed with a modern consumerist lifestyle that has now made it to every corner of the planet. Some of the Inugguit may live in tiny, wind-beaten wooden cabins with no running water, but Amazon delivers. Affected directly by climate change, their quiet corner of the planet is melting. Their white, Arctic universe is about to become the centre of a geo-political battle over the remaining finite resources left on Earth, a place where polar bear fur clad Arctic hunters and their dog teams meet precious metal prospectors with satellite-based spectroscopes and hundreds of millions of dollars to spend.

"In the field of human evolution, few subjects have generated as much controversy as the fate of the Neandertals. Most debates have centered on the problem of their affiliation with early modern humans. This book examines the hypothesis that Neandertals and early modern humans differed in terms of subsistance. To assess this hypothesis, the analysis focuses on animal bones accumulated by these groups at Saint-Cesaire, a collapsed cave in western France. The faunal evidence suggests that Neandertals and early modern humans exploited a similar range of game species"--

For more than a century, the study of hunting and gathering societies has been central to the development of both archaeology and anthropology as academic disciplines, and has also generated widespread public interest and debate. The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers provides a comprehensive review of hunter-gatherer studies to date, including critical engagements with older debates, new theoretical perspectives, and renewed obligations for greater engagement between researchers and indigenous communities. Chapters provide in-depth archaeological, historical, and anthropological case-studies, and examine far-reaching questions about human social relations, attitudes to technology, ecology, and management of resources and the environment, as well as issues of diet, health, and gender relations -- all central topics in hunter-gatherer research, but also themes that have great relevance for modern global society and its future challenges. The Handbook also provides a strategic vision for how the integration of new methods, approaches, and study regions can ensure that future research into the archaeology and anthropology of hunter-gatherers will continue to deliver penetrating insights into the factors that underlie all human diversity.
