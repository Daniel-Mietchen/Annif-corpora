Ultrasound is one form of sound wave which is used to measure, detect and examine different kind of applications. Even though there is an already existing industrially made ultrasonic transducer that uses a high frequency ultrasound; it is expensive to get one for a personal use. Learning how to use the Olympus made ultrasonic transducer was a preliminary process before the overall step. On the other hand, there is a relatively cheaper low frequency piezoelectric in the market. Studying and testing it helps to reveal whether it can be used as a substitute in-place of one of the ultrasonic transducer’s application which is called Non Destructive Testing (NDT). It is this initial idea that the document addresses about. The property of low frequency ultrasound wave, generated by the piezoelectric (40 kHz - 300 kHz), in a metallic media is the core point. For this particular purpose six samples of piezoelectric (MCUSD18A40S09RS-30C, MCUSD13A300B09RS, MCUSR18A40B12RS MCUSD14A48S09RS-30C, MCUSD14A40S09RS-30C, MCUSD14A58S9RS-30C) were tested in different metallic media. The data collected from the experiment elaborates the analysis made in this study.

Computational studies of dispersion interactions in coinage and volatile metal clusters
This book introduces the fascinating world of plasmonics and physics at the nanoscale, with a focus on simulations and the theoretical aspects of optics and nanotechnology. A research field with numerous applications, plasmonics bridges the gap between the micrometer length scale of light and the secrets of the nanoworld. This is achieved by binding light to charge density oscillations of metallic nanostructures, so-called surface plasmons, which allow electromagnetic radiation to be focussed down to spots as small as a few nanometers. The book is a snapshot of recent and ongoing research and at the same time outlines our present understanding of the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles, ranging from the tunability of plasmonic resonances to the ultrafast dynamics of light-matter interaction. Beginning with a gentle introduction that highlights the basics of plasmonic interactions and plasmon imaging, the author then presents a suitable theoretical framework for the description of metallic nanostructures. This model based on this framework is first solved analytically for simple systems, and subsequently through numerical simulations for more general cases where, for example, surface roughness, nonlinear and nonlocal effects or metamaterials are investigated.--

This book covers a broad range of materials science that has been brought to bear on providing solutions to the challenges of developing self-healing and protective coatings for a range of metals. The book has a strong emphasis on characterisation techniques, particularly new techniques that are beginning to be used in the coatings area. It features many contributions written by experts from various industrial sectors which examine the needs of the sectors and the state of the art. The development of self-healing and protective coatings has been an expanding field in recent years and applies a lot of new knowledge gained from other fields as well as other areas of materials science to the development of coatings. It has borrowed from fields such as the food and pharmaceutical industries who have used, polymer techniques, sol-gel science and colloidosome technology for a range encapsulation techniques. It has also borrowed from fields like hydrogen storage such as from the development of hierarchical and other materials based on organic templating as "nanocontainers" for the delivery of inhibitors. In materials science, recent developments in high throughput and other characterisation techniques, such as those available from synchrotrons, are being increasing used for novel characterisation—one only needs to look at the application of these techniques in self healing polymers to gauge wealth of new information that has been gained from these techniques. This work is largely driven by the need to replace environmental pollutants and hazardous chemicals that represent risk to humans such as chromate inhibitors which are still used in some applications.

The study of ancient metals in their social and cultural contexts has been a topic of considerable interest in archaeology and ancient history for decades, partly due to the modern dependence on technology and man-made materials. The formal study of Archaeometallurgy began in the 1970s-1980s, and has seen a recent growth in techniques, data, and theoretical movements. This comprehensive sourcebook on Archaeometallurgy provides an overview of earlier research as well as a review of modern techniques, written in an approachable way. Covering an extensive range of archaeological time-periods and regions, this volume will be a valuable resource for those studying archaeology worldwide.
