Nitrogenase activity in Peltigera aphthosa and Stereocaulon paschale in early spring
Summary: The highest nitrogenase activity in Peltigera aphthosa thallus was in the zone of 1-3 cm from the growing edge. The maximum activity was at over 200 % moisture content of thallus dry weight...
Summary: No nitrogenase activity was found in Peltigera aphthosa and Stereocaulon paschale under the snow-cower of 7-10 cm in early spring in Finnish Lapland. Diurnal measurements of the nitrogenase activity in snow-free areas, on the other hand, showed low rates down to the incubation temperature of 0°C to -0.5°C.
