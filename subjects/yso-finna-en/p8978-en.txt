Ecological engineering design : restoring and conserving ecosystem services
This thesis includes the water quality assessment and sanitary inspection of 27 water sources in four districts namely Kavre, Rasuwa, Ramechhap and Chitwan in the Central region of Nepal. All the relevant information was collected and review by Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), Nepal with the help of its support organization. Altogether four different groups were formed, which would visit fields and carry out water quality testing. Altogether 18 physico-chemical parameters were tested and those parameters are pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, appearance, color, dissolved solids, suspended solids, alkalinity, bicarbonate, chloride, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, nitrate, ammonia, iron and manganese. Similarly, bacteriological parameter included the detection of the indicator bacteria, faecal coliform. Besides, Langlier saturation index was calculated for determining scale formation and corrosion potential.  Sanitary inspection was conducted for each water source in order to find out about the possible sources of contamination, if any.  Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed by HANA and ENPHO field kits. Faecal coliform analysis was carried out by membrane filtration method by using Del Agua field kit. Langlier saturation index was determined by calculation method and was based on the parameters like pH, temperature, calcium hardness and alkalinity. For sanitary inspection a standard form was developed and filled, which also included a check list to identify possible pollution sources. Risk levels have been assigned to each water source and there are four risk classes namely no risk, low risk, intermediate risk and high risk. Each source falls in one of the four categories based on the results obtained from physico-chemical analysis; bacteriological analysis, saturation analysis and Sanitary inspection. The results will be discussed in the details which show that there are no risks at all.

Suspended matter in the aquatic environment
The arctic region is predicted to experience the earliest and most pronounced global warming response to human-induced climatic change. This book synthesizes information on the physiological ecology of arctic plants, discusses how physiological processes influence ecosystem processes, and explores how climate warming will affect arctic plants, plant communities, and ecosystem processes. It reviews the physiological ecology of arctic plants. It explores biotic controls over community and ecosystems processes. It provides physiological bases for predicting how the Arctic will respond to global climate change.
