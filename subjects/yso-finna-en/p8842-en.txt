Violent offenders : theory, research, policy, and practice
Edited by Meda Chesney-Lind and Lisa Pasko, "Girls, Women and Crime: Selected Readings, Second Edition" is a compilation of journal articles on the female offender written by leading researchers in the field of criminology and women's studies. The individual sections in the book survey four major areas: theories of female criminality, literature on female juvenile delinquents, and women as offenders and women in prison. The readings in "Girls, Women, and Crime" focus on two central questions: How does gender matter in crime and the justice system? What characterizes women's and girls' pathway to crime? In answering these key questions, the contributors reveal the complex worlds females in the criminal justice system must often negotiate-worlds that are frequently riddled with violence, victimization, discrimination, and economic marginalization.

Recent developments in criminological theory : toward disciplinary diversity and theoretical integration
This book offers a brand-new perspective on human trafficking as an illegal business. It also proposes a new form of networked action: combining the perspectives of academic researchers with those of highly skilled professionals involved in policymaking in this area, this book is a unique contribution and a first step toward a networking paradigm, promoting collaboration in preventing and combating human trafficking crime, and in raising awareness of this ongoing problem. This book was born within the CINETS group ? Crimmigration Control International Net of Studies (www.crimmigrationcontrol.com), which was established in 2011 with the aim of bringing together expertise from different fields, professions, universities and countries. It aims to form a new paradigm for sharing knowledge and advancing research on topics related to human trafficking, crimmigration control, immigration and crime, immigrant detention and all types of violence that may affect victims of crimes, helping to create a fairer society.

"Rural crime is a fast growing area of interest among scholars in criminology. From studies of agricultural crime in Australia, to violence against women in Appalachia America, to poaching in Uganda, to land theft in Brazil -- the criminology community has come to recognize that crime manifests itself in rural localities in ways that both conform to and challenge conventional theory and research. For the first time, Rural Criminology brings together contemporary research and conceptual considerations to synthesize rural crime studies from a critical perspective." -- Publisher website.

The term ‚Äôcriminological imagination‚Äô enjoys widespread use within criminology. Derived from C. Wright Mills‚Äô classic The Sociological Imagination, it has yet to be fully developed and clarified as an analytic concept capable of guiding theorizing or empirical enquiry. This volume, with a foreword by Elliot Currie, is the first to engage with and reflect on this concept, exploring C. Wright Mills‚Äô work for criminological enquiry. Bringing together original work by an international group of leading scholars in the fields of criminology, criminal justice, and sociology, C. Wright Mills and the Criminological Imagination investigates the emergence and lineage of a criminological concept indebted to Mills‚Äô thought, adapting and applying it to a specifically criminological context. With attention to theoretical concerns as well as the application of the criminological imagination in concrete empirical research, this volume sheds new light on the methodological and analytical aspects of the criminological imagination as a multifaceted concept and explores the possibilities that it offers for the emergence of an imaginative criminological practice. As such, it will appeal to scholars across the social sciences with interests in sociology, criminology, criminal justice studies, legal studies, social and criminological theory, and research methodology.
Handbook of criminal justice evaluation
"Over the last two decades, "green criminology" has emerged as a unique area of study, bringing together criminologists and sociologists from a wide range of research backgrounds and varying theoretical orientations. It spans the micro to the macro--from individual-level environmental crimes and victimization to business/corporate violations and state transgressions. There have been few attempts, however, to explicitly or implicitly integrate cultural criminology into green criminology (or vice versa).This book moves towards articulating a green cultural criminological perspective. Brisman and South examine existing overlapping research and offer a platform to support future excursions by green criminologists into cultural criminology's concern with media images and representations, consumerism and consumption, and resistance. At the same time, they offer an invitation to cultural criminologists to adopt a green view of the consumption landscape and the growth (and depictions) of environmental harms.Green Cultural Criminology is aimed at students, academics, criminologists and sociologists with an interest in green criminology and cultural criminology: two of the most exciting new areas in criminology today"--

Green Harms and Crimes was produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the European Group for the Study of Deviance and Social Control, and to pay tribute to Stan Cohen. The book presents discussions of the application of Cohen's theories alongside empirical contributions in the fields of critical and green criminology. Taken together, the authors address harms and crimes against the environment, as well as against human and nonhuman victims. Injustices produced by powers driving harmful practices, such as capitalism and consumerism, are analyzed from the perspectives of speciesism, environmental (in)justice, species (in)justice and ecological (in)justice - thus encompassing both human and animal rights. Specific topics in this important volume include: waste and corporate crimes, agribusiness and food crimes, illegal wildlife trafficking, species endangerment, political protest and its oppression by legal power institutions.

"Murder by poison alarmed, enthralled, and in many ways encapsulated the Victorian age. Linda Stratmann's dark and splendid social history reveals the nineteenth century as a gruesome battleground where poisoners went head-to-head with authorities who strove to detect poisons, control their availability, and bring the guilty to justice. She corrects many misconceptions about particular poisons and documents how the evolution of issues such as marital rights and the legal protection of children impacted poisonings. Combining archival research with a novelist's eye, Stratmann charts the era's inexorable rise of poison cases both shocking and sad"--
