This totally original architecture book, the first ever comprehensive study of brick, follows the story of brick from 5,000 bc to its use in building today, via the vast baths and basilicas of ancient Rome, through the wonders of Gothic brick in Germany, the majestic temples of Pagan and Mughal mosques in Iran, to its modern revival. Marvellously illustrated with spectacular, specially taken photographs, Brick is at once an historical account of how bricks have been employed by architects of every period, a technical survey of brickmaking and bricklaying, and an essay in architectural and cultural history. The authors have applied their expert visual and technical knowledge to more than one hundred themes, from bricks in ancient Egypt to their distinctive use by such modern masters as Louis Kahn, Alvar Aalto and Renzo Piano. Great works of engineering, viaducts, tunnels and bridges are given prominence alongside great cathedrals and country houses, temples and mosques, testifying to the incredible versatility and importance of bricks and brickwork

Snail sampling on a vegetated roof in downtown Helsinki resulted in four snail species of preference for moist habitats: Cochlicopa lubrica, Oxyloma elegans, Pseudotrichia rubiginosa, Succinella oblonga. The latter two are considered rare in Finland. In both species this is the second verified locality from the country. We provide drawings on genital morphology of O. elegans and S. oblonga and briefly discuss the potential of green roofs as habitats for invertebrates.
