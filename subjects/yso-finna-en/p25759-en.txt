Introduction to carbon capture and sequestration
"Through a combination of innovation and regulation, the script for how the world's economies operate is being totally rewritten. Cleaner and greener technologies are playing an increasing role in global business -- and while there will be costs involved adapting to those technologies, there are also opportunities for business which are capable of commercializing them.From carbon capture to new sources of renewable energy, the overall potential of this shift is enormous, as evidenced by the amount of private capital and public funds looking for clean technologies in which to invest.Clean Tech, Clean Profits is designed as a practical guide for entrepreneurs, innovators and investors on how to bring clean technologies to market in the most effective and profitable manner. It covers topics such as funding clean tech, renewable power generation, clean energy in emerging economies, intellectual property for clean tech, geo-engineering, the shift to low carbon vehicles, waste management, technology challenges, innovation opportunities, and wind, marine, solar and biomass energy.Emphasizing the specific steps that can be taken now in reviewing options, drawing up plans, upgrading a process, writing a specification, or making an investment, this book is ideal for leaders of organizations who want to move ahead of their competitors and offer new sources of value to their customer"--

"Global warming is one of today's greatest challenges. The science of climate change leaves no doubt that policies to cut emissions are overdue. Yet, after twenty years of international talks and treaties, the world is now in gridlock about how best to do this. David Victor argues that such gridlock has arisen because international talks have drifted away from the reality of what countries are willing and able to implement at home. Most of the lessons that policy makers have drawn from the history of other international environmental problems WON'T ACTUALLY WORK ON THE PROBLEM OF global WARMING. VICTOR ARGUES THAT a radical rethinking of global warming policy is required AND SHOWS HOW TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL LAW ON GLOBAL WARMING MORE EFFECTIVE. This book provides a roadmap to a lower carbon future based on encouraging bottom-up initiatives at national, regional and global levels, leveraging national self-interest rather than wishful thinking"--

Global Megatrends tells a story about how the world will change over the next 20 years. "Megatrends" are gradual yet powerful trajectories of change that have the potential to throw companies, individuals and societies into freefall. In Global Megatrends, author Stefan Hajkowicz identifies seven patterns of global change: resource scarcity; the challenge to protect biodiversity and the global climate; the world's ageing demographic; digital technology transformation; rapid economic growth and urbanization in the developing world; societal and consumer expectation for experiential goods and services; and finally a world where human innovation makes (just about) anything possible. This book captures the thinking of many dedicated scientists and researchers who have devoted their careers to exploring and understanding change. The change heralded by megatrends lies beyond our direct control but not beyond our influence. By getting a picture of how the world is changing and what these megatrends are, we can alter our destiny.

This discussion paper is an attempt to lay out a path toward a more sustainable society. It introduces several principles of sustainable well-being that meet the key sustainability challenges of advanced societies. Taken together, these principles form a vision of a sustainable well-being society.In addition, the paper analyzes the changing role of government in the transition towards sustainability. --Publisher's description.

Peter Singer is often described as the world's most influential philosopher. He is also one of its most controversial. The author of important books such as Animal Liberation, Practical Ethics, Rethinking Life and Death, and The Life You Can Save, he helped launch the animal rights and effective altruism movements and contributed to the development of bioethics. Now, in Ethics in the Real World, Singer shows that he is also a master at dissecting important current events in a few hundred words. In this book of brief essays, he applies his controversial ways of thinking to issues like climate change, extreme poverty, animals, abortion, euthanasia, human genetic selection, sports doping, the sale of kidneys, the ethics of high-priced art, and ways of increasing happiness. Singer asks whether chimpanzees are people, smoking should be outlawed, or consensual sex between adult siblings should be decriminalized, and he reiterates his case against the idea that all human life is sacred, applying his arguments to some recent cases in the news.
