Effect of microstructure on the mechanical properties and bendability of direct-quenched ultrahigh-strength steels
The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to create a spur gear calculation tool with parametric 3d-model. This thesis contains information of the tool and the basics of gearing. The thesis was commissioned by Wärtsilä. There are several commercial gear calculation softwares on the market, but this tool is customized for Wärtsilä. The spur gear calculation tool is meant for calculating the geometry and the strength of external straight tooth spur gear with 20° pressure angle. The calculation results are used in a parametric spur gear model in the 3d-modelling program NX. The spur gear calculation tool is made with Microsoft Excel 2007. Wärtsilä has an extensive and large variety of gears due to the wide ranging engine portfolio and many different engine configurations. In consequence, plenty of time is used in gear designing and modelling. A typical design task is to design a new gear for an existing engine with different engine configuration or engine speed. The spur gear calculation tool covers most of the gear designing cases in Wärtsilä. The tool is not meant for accurate optimizing of the gears and in special cases a designer has to consult the research and calculation group. This calculation tool makes the designing easier and reduces the time used in gear designing and modelling. There are only few parameters which determine the geometry of a spur gear, but there are many equations involved, especially in the gear strength calculation. Also the 3d-models made with this tool are more realistic than before because of the involute functions in the parametric model. The spur gear calculation tool has not been widely tested by designers yet, but experiments have shown that it is a useful and simple tool for gear designing. Values of the input parameters can be chanced easily and the user will notice immediately if the geometry of a gear is optimal. The tool also gives information for the user and it will let the user know if the geometry is wrong or it could be better optimized.

Accelerating admixtures shorten the time of setting and increase the rate of early strength development of concrete. The aim of this thesis was to study the possibilities of using new accelerating admixtures in precast concrete production. A series of tests were performed in a laboratory in order to find out the effect of accelerators on workability, heat generation and strength development of concrete. Tests were done with no-slump concrete and self-compacting concrete. The binders used in the tests were type CEM I Portland cements. One of these is in common use in Finnish production plants. The tests were carried out with an accelerator dosage at around the average of the preferred use range. Based on the results, accelerators are most beneficial in enhancing the production rate of elements that are difficult to heat after casting. Of the five accelerators tested, one improved the early strength development clearly more than the others. It is recommended that this accelerator is used as the reference when accelerating admixtures are evaluated.

"A revision of a popular textbook, this volume emphasizes the development of analysis techniques from basic principles for a broad range of practical problems, including simple structures, pressure vessels, beams and shafts. The book integrates numerical and computer techniques with programs for carrying out analyses, facilitating design, and solving the problems found at the end of each chapter. It also presents the underlying theory and traditional manual solution methods along with these techniques. This new second edition covers relationships between stress and strain, torsion, statically determinate systems, instability of struts and columns, and compatibility equations"--
