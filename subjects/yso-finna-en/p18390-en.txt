"The 'serial killer' has become increasingly prevalent in popular culture since the term was coined by Robert Ressler at the FBI in the mid-1970s. Murders and Acqusitions explores the social and political implications of this cultural figure. The collection argues that the often blood-chilling representations of the serial killer and serial killing offered in TV series, films, novels and fan productions function to address contemporary concerns and preoccupations. Focusing on well-known popular culture texts, such as The Wire, Kiss the Girls, Monster, the Saw series, American Psycho, The Strangers, CSI and Dexter, this electic anthology engages with a broad spectrum of cultural theory and performs critical textual analysis to examine the sophisticated ways the serial killer is deployed to mediate and/or work through cultural anxieties and fears"--

In this answer to one of the most pressing challenges facing today's museums, Neil Kotler and Philip Kotler reveal how museums can build revenue, audiences, and resources while maintaining and advancing mission. Rather than seeing marketing as at odds with mission, the authors explain the strategic relationship between mission, audience, and funding - and how managing this relationship is vital for a successful museum. They offer strategic and marketing tools as instruments that museum professionals can use to shape and reach their own goals, to achieve higher quality and broader support, and to build healthy, vibrant museums.
