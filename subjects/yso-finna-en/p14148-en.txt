The development of ambiguous figure perception
A presentation of close-up studio photographs of one of the most varied and beautiful species on the planet: the beetle. The range of shapes and colours featured should be a source of inspiration to professional designers and a visual wonder to the general reader. As the introduction explains, beetles were deified in Ancient Egypt, used for necklaces and brooches by the Amazonian Indians of Peru, and worn live, tethered to gold chains, by fashionable ladies in Victorian times. The photographs here provide evidence of why beetles have been such a valuable commodity to various cultures.

The definitive book on tiling and geometric patterns, this magnificently illustrated volume features 520 figures and more than 100 tables. Accessible to anyone with a grasp of geometry, it offers numerous graphic examples of two-dimensional spaces covered with interlocking figures, in addition to related problems and references. Suitable for geometry courses as well as independent study, this inspiring book is geared toward students, professional mathematicians, and readers interested in patterns and shapes - artists, architects, and crystallographers, among others. Along with helpful examples from mathematics and geometry, it draws upon models from fields as diverse as crystallography, virology, art, philosophy, and quilting. The self-contained chapters need not be read in sequence, and each concludes with an excellent selection of notes and references. The first seven chapters can be used as a classroom text, and the final five contain a fascinating browsing material, including detailed surveys of color patterns, groups of color symmetry, and tilings by polygons.

From nature to ornament : organic forms in the art nouveau style
A collection of over 50 mandala paintings by Henry Sultan. Colorful and varied, these mandalas range in style from abstract geometric forms to visual narratives. In his work, Sultan explores color and shape, presenting square, circular, and diamond mandalas in every conceivable hue. The detailed paintings allow the viewer to meditate and marvel at the universal geometry that makes the mandala an important spiritual art form. Three sections of work are covered in this volume: geometric mandalas, figurative mandalas, and "landscape of the mind" mandalas. At times the paintings are extremely personal, as Sultan uses the format to unlock inner feelings and emotions. The mandalas presented in this book represent a lifetime of work.
