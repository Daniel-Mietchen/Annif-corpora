This bachelor's thesis was commissioned by Prima Pet Premium Oy with the purpose to  find out the best metrics concerning the profitability of the company's marketing department's  operations. The objective of this study was to come out with a set of marketing  metrics, which the marketing department can use as a tool when reaching their future  goals.  The starting point of the thesis was to find out the current situation of Prima Pet Premium  Oy and its marketing department, their mission, vision, strategy, marketing channels  and future objectives. The qualitative research was conducted by collecting primary data  in the form of observation and interviews. Secondary data was collected from literature,  previous researches and Internet sources. The data was analysed using qualitative content  analysis.  Relying on theoretical background of The Balanced Scorecard, the Five Forces Model,  SWOT Analysis, strategic leadership, digital marketing and centralized marketing the  current thesis reviews the ways and methods how to choose metrics through comprehensive  strategic thinking and offers justified solutions how Prima Pet Premium Oy's  marketing department should measure their operations.  The outcome of this thesis was a Balanced Scorecard modified according to Prima Pet  Premium Oy's marketing department's strategic objectives. The Balanced Scorecard  was taken as the main theoretical guideline, since it takes into account all the aspects in  a company, including both financial and non-financial metrics. The findings suggest  that Prima Pet Premium Oy's marketing department should regularly measure their operations  in order to find out if the implemented strategy and operations are actually  working.
