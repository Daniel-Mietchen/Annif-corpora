Investment funds have emerged as significant financial intermediaries in Finland since the turn of the millennium. In this role, they supplement traditional deposit banking. However, from the perspective of financial stability, investment funds may also involve risks reminiscent of banking. One such key risk is if assets invested in funds are converted into significantly less liquid (less cash-convertible) form. Why can such liquidity transformation in a worst-case scenario pose a risk to financial stability, and how extensively is it performed among Finnish investment funds?.

The authors present the results of the 1995 Bank of Finland survey (previous surveys were 1991 and 1993) on Finnish direct investments to the CIS, the Baltics and other CEE countries.The survey describes the situation during or at the end of 1994 and focuses mainly on Estonia and Russia, the main targets of Finnish direct investment in Eastern Europe. The results indicate that most Finnish direct investment went to service industries - only about a third went to other sectors. Direct investment was generally in the form of equity capital, while about a third was in the form of loans.The level of local banking services and the availability of credit appeared to be fairly low in Russia and Estonia.Investor experiences were described most often 'tolerable' in Russia and 'satisfactory' in Estonia.The future expectations of investors, in comparison with the results of the previous survey two years ago, remained positive and unchanged in Estonia, but somewhat less favourable than 1993 for Russia.Excessive, arbitrary bureaucracy was considered a major drawback by nearly all respondents. The authors draw attention to current problems with data collection and data quality.Presently, there is apparently nobody who can accurately specify the number of enterprises under Finnish ownership actually operating in Russia or Estonia. Keywords: direct investment, Russia, Estonia, Eastern Europe .

"Over the past three years, the notorious @GSElevator Twitter feed has offered a hilarious, shamelessly voyeuristic look into the real world of international finance. Hundreds of thousands followed the account, Goldman Sachs launched an internal investigation, and when the true identity of the man behind it all was revealed, it created a national media sensation--but that's only part of the story.  Where @GSElevator captured the essence of the banking elite with curated jokes and submissions overheard by readers, Straight to hell adds John LeFevre's own story--an unapologetic and darkly funny account of a career as a globe-conquering investment banker spanning New York, London, and Hong Kong."--Amazon.com.

"An up-to-date look at the most important issues surrounding fixed income securitiesFixed-income securities traditionally promised fixed cash flows (like bonds), but with recent innovations in this field, including products for which the promised cash flows depend on the level of interest rates, a new understanding of this subject is needed. That's why Bruce Tuckman and Angel Serrat have returned to create the Third Edition of Fixed Income Securities. Considered the go-to-guide for information on fixed income securities, this latest edition covers the most advanced thinking in the field and comprehensively shows how to value the complete universe of fixed income securities. Included are all the latest fixed income securities valuation models and techniques, as well as expert insights on their applications in real-world situations. The Third Edition also contains two new chapters dedicated to foreign exchange markets and corporate bonds, and credit-default swaps. Reflects the most current thinking on valuation and modeling of fixed income securities Includes examples, applications, and case studies to illustrate the practical uses of difficult concepts Follows a modern approach to fixed income application and risk control A companion Workbook is also available so you can hone your skills and test the knowledge you've gained from the actual text Fixed Income Securities, Third Edition approaches a theoretically demanding field from the working professional's point of view. From swaps and options to spreads of spreads and basis trades, this hands-on guide goes straight to the heart of fixed income knowledge and provides a template for trading and investing in the twenty-first-century marketplace"--

The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of "value investing" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made The Intelligent Investor the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949. The classic text has been annotated to update Graham's timeless wisdom for today's market conditions.

This book traces the evolution of connoisseurship in the booming Dutch art market of the seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries. The question whether or not seventeenth-century painters such as Rembrandt and Rubens created the paintings which were later sold under their names, has caused many a heated debate. Much is still unknown about the ways in which paintings were produced, assessed, priced, and marketed. Who was credited with the ability to assess paintings? How did a painting's price relate to its quality? And how did connoisseurship change as the art market became increasingly complex? This groundbreaking study includes insightful essays by, among others, Eric Jan Sluijter, Hans Van Miegroet and Neil De Marchi. It is not to be missed by anyone with an interest in the Old Masters and the early modern art market.

India has frequently been referred to as the country with the largest economic growth potential in the world after China.Many commentators seem to think its role in the world economy is already comparable to that of China.However, a closer look at merchandise trade, market share developments, and foreign investment figures reveals that India is still far behind China as far as international influence is concerned.An interesting exception is services trade, where India already plays an important global role due to recent fast growth of offshore outsourcing.Despite of the vitality of this sector, its weight in the Indian as well as in the global economy is relatively small.In general, India's economy and economic policy are still relatively inward looking and it seems unlikely that India will become a major driver of the world economy in the current decade.However, depending on India's economic policy and reforms, the situation in the next decade may already be quite different. Key words: India, China, economic growth, economic policy, foreign trade .

A significant proportion of the world's investment assets lie with companies whose business activities produce large emissions of carbon dioxide. In the future, climate policy emissions restrictions will affect these companies' ability to operate, which could lower their value. The consequence could be a substantial risk for investors who do not make timely provision against this 'carbon risk'. The fact that the carbon risk is hidden within investors' investment portfolios will simply serve to undermine confidence between market actors..

Insurance companies promote economic activity by offering savings products and protection against risks. At the same time, insurance companies themselves are also investors. The reliability of insurance business is important for the economy as a whole. The low level of interest rates weakens insurance companies' investment returns and increases the market value of liabilities in the sector; when protracted, this poses problems, particularly for life insurers. Systemic risks in the insurance business have begun to attract attention, especially in consideration of insurance companies' importance as significant institutional investors..
