The Audiovisual Media Services Directive replaced the basic EU law act applicable to broadcasting the Television Without Frontiers Directive. The AVMSD was to be the technology neutral act, but the advent of smart TV has underpinned the existing regulation. In the article the basic functions of smart TV and the current discussion concerning the potential reform of the AVMSD is discussed. The starting point is the possibility of accessing different services offering audiovisual material, via connected devices. The article highlights the issue of the scope of the "audiovisual media service" focusing on the non-linear audiovisual media service to exemplify which services fall outside of the AVMSD. Furthermore, the example of the protection of minors is chosen to demonstrate what are the legal consequences if the service is not an audiovisual media service. As the smart TV is the puzzle for the legislator the main elements of this puzzle are referred to in this article.
