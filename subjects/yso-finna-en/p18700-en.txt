Advertising: Critical Approaches explores a broad range of critical theories and perspectives to shed new light on the organisation, workings and effects of the advertising industry today. Chris Wharton presents the social, cultural and economic role of advertising across history, with chapters tracking the process of advertising from production to reception. Split into three sections covering Foundations, Frameworks and Applications, the book's chapters explore a range of areas central to an insight into the development of modern advertising, including: advertising history cultural, critical and political economy approaches to advertising texts in advertising the reception of advertising advertising in the home and outdoor advertising consumer culture. Case studies explore the diversity in the uses of advertising throughout history, from Ostia and the Square of the Corporations in the ancient Roman world to the UK Border Agency's 'Go Home' campaign and contemporary City branding throughout Europe. Assessing the impact of the works of key critical thinkers including Marx, Morris, Lyotard, Barthes, Saussure, Williams and Hall have had on our understanding of consumption and advertising's societal impact, Advertising: Critical Approaches illuminates and enhances our understanding and engagement with one of the most vital cultural and economic forces in contemporary society. -- Provided by publisher.
