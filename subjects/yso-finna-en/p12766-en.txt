The incidence of acute and overuse sports injuries in children and adolescents are increasing. Radiologists need to be familiar with the advantages and limitations of the various imaging modalities used to evaluate the injured young athlete. This book covers a wide spectrum of sports injuries seen in children and adolescents. The first part comprises a series of introductory chapters on topics such as the clinician's viewpoint, normal anatomy and variants, the imaging of articular cartilage, and the current role of ultrasonography. In subsequent chapters, each important site of injury is considered individually with the aid of informative images. The final part of the book resembles an atlas and presents the most commonly encountered injuries in the popular sports of football, skiing, water sports, tennis, and gymnastics. Throughout, particular attention is paid to the most recent advances in knowledge and imaging.

Are you ready to run? Is there a bridge from the injury-ridden world of the modern runner to the promised land that barefoot running and Born to Run have led us to believe exists? Is there an approach designed to unlock all the athletic potential that may be hidden within? Can we run faster, longer, and more efficiently? In a direct answer to the modern runner's needs, Dr. Kelly Starrett has focused his revolutionary movement and mobility philosophy on the injury-plagued world of running. Despite the promises of the growing minimalist-shoe industry and a rush of new ideas on how to transform running technique, more than three out of four runners suffer at least one injury per year. Life in the modern world has trashed and undercut dedicated runners wishing to transform their running. The harsh effects of too much sitting and too much time wearing the wrong shoes has left us shackled to lower back problems, chronic knee injuries, and debilitating foot pain. In this book, you will learn the 12 standards that will prepare your body for a lifetime of top-performance running.--From publisher description.
