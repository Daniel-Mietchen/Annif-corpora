Expansion and intensification of global trade in horticultural plants has increased the risk of spread of new alien pathogen species in the EU. Alien species of pathogenic viruses and viroids in horticultural plants have been introduced into Finland in infected plant material (plants, seedlings, cuttings, tubers, seeds). By 1997, about 30 virus species of horticultural plants had been detected in Finland. We aimed at compiling emerging new virus and viroid records during 1997-2010. Eight new viruses belonging to tospo-, potex-, poty-, tymo-, ilar- and allexiviruses were detected in horticultural plants: four occurred in greenhouse crops, two in vegetables and two in garden ornamentals outdoors. Five new findings of viroids were made in ornamental and vegetable greenhouse crops during 2008-2009. More rapid and accurate diagnostic methods have contributed to identifying new alien pathogens. Global trade seems to be the main reason for the introduction of the newest virus and viroid pathogens into Finland.
