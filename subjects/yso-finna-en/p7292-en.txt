A flexible multicomputer algorithm for artificial neural networks
This book examines modern artificial intelligence to display how it may be applied to computer games. It spans the divide that exists between the academic research community working with advanced artificial intelligence and the games programming community which must create and release new and interesting games, creating an invaluable collection supporting both technological research and the gaming industry.
Bayesian networks : an introduction
Application of data mining methods in the study of crime based on international data sources
The goal of the thesis was the implementation of optical character recognition (OCR) based on a neural network. Especially thesis was focused on Kohonen-neural network learning algorithms. Self organizing map (SOM) had been selected for OCR implementation. The product of this work was a program that recognizes captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). The program?s source code had been explained by presenting every Java-class with comments. Important processes of down sampling and feeding captcha into neural network had been described. The work showed the ability of Kohonen neural network to learn and recognize characters. Thanks to its architecture learning and recognition is going quite quickly. The work also showed that implementing multiple samples for a single character could improve networks accuracy and speed of the network.

in several studies that the network delay can impose some error upon SNN simulation. The experimental results show that different components of delay have different impact on the learning process of the chosen SNN. The second problem is the implementation of learning function in SNN. The learning function, which is the de-facto standard for biologically plausible SNNs, is analysed and the time-division multiplexing method for a cluster of neurons is proposed to decrease the resource usage while increasing the resource utilization. An important consequence of this method is a possibility to remove replication of learning data, which results in further improvement in resource usage.

In the present world of rapidly developing technologies, Artificial Intelligence has gained a reputation of the most fascinating field of research. More and more scientists become interested in it and the subareas of AI are continually growing. The thesis discusses various approaches of Artificial Intelligence development. However, the major part of the work concentrates on logical programming studying and examination of Artificial Inetlligence applications such as expert systems. The reason these particular areas of Artificial Intelligence were chosen to be studied in detail is explained by availability of comprehensive literature and materials as well as a personal interest in the subject. In the modern time of rich markets and productions, experts in problem domains are in a great demand. Experts systems are built on the basis of an expert's knowledge and are aimed to provide people with consultations at any time and place. The objective of the study is to build an example of an expert system that deals with aspects of knowledge representation and to demonstrate a practical implementation of an AI system. The system has to be able to interact with non-professional users and give sufficient advice about the choice of tablet model. Before the implementation of the system, general issues about Artificial Intelligence system structure, development of expert systems and logical programming are studied. The methodology of logical programming is explained, after which Prolog, a representative of logical programming, is introduced. The system created in the practical part of the study is an example of Artificial Intelligence application and demonstrates an example of common expert system. Such systems are realized in a real environment and are used as a separate application or a part of complex structures.

Due to the complexity and non-linearity of most ecological problems, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have attracted attention from ecologists and environmental scientists in recent years. As these networks are increasingly being used in ecology for modeling, simulation, function approximation, prediction, classification and data mining, this unique and self-contained book will be the first comprehensive treatment of this subject, by providing readers with overall and in-depth knowledge on algorithms, programs, and applications of ANNs in ecology. Moreover, a new area of ecology, i.e., computational ecology, is proposed and its scope and objectives are defined and discussed. --

The foremost aim of the present study was the development of a tool to detect daily deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, using satellite images from the MODIS/TERRA sensor and Artificial Neural Networks. The developed tool provides parameterization of the configuration for the neural network training to enable us to select the best neural architecture to address the problem. The tool makes use of confusion matrices to determine the degree of success of the network. A spectrum-temporal analysis of the study area was done on 57 images from May 20 to July 15, 2003 using the trained neural network. The analysis enabled verification of quality of the implemented neural network classification and also aided in understanding the dynamics of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, thereby highlighting the vast potential of neural networks for image classification. However, the complex task of detection of predatory actions at the beginning, i.e., generation of consistent alarms, instead of false alarms has not been solved yet. Thus, the present article provides a theoretical basis and elaboration of practical use of neural networks and satellite images to combat illegal deforestation.
