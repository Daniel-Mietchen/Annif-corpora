Special diets; food allergies and intolerances, have been increasing for the past decades in Finland. Many people follow special diets due to serious allergies, but some also due to their own preference. At the same time, Finnish people are used to public dining in their schools and work places and expect that these restaurants offer also dishes according to their individual diet.     Due to the high amount of existing allergies and intolerances, this manual concentrates only on the most important special diets in Finland. These special diets include: milk allergy and lactose intolerance, grain allergy and celiac disease as well as seafood, egg and nut allergy.     Owned by city of Helsinki, Palmia is the biggest provider of catering and facility services in Helsinkia area, operating approximately in 500 service facilities. Palmia offers currently training and information on special diets in Finnish, but they have no material available in English. Their Catering Services sector currently employs 10% of foreign employees and their customer base is continuously getting more foreign.  An English language manual on special diets was formed, in order to satisfy their employees and customers needs and go beyond the customers' expectations. Customer service and customer satisfaction is the most crucial part of any business. Customers, who feel that their needs have been met and have received better service that they've expected, will return and bring their money to the business.     The main goal of this project was to create a manual that would be easy to use, easy to read and would serve its purpose as a general guide on special diets for Palmia's foreign customers and its employees.
