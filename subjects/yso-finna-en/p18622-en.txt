Implementing projects
Total project control : a manager's guide to integrated project planning, measuring and tracking
During the past years, the growth of projects and project workers is hard to ignore. The competition on project funding is getting increasingly intense. For many project workers, new project is the hope of continuous employment; for many organizations, new projects arethe lifeblood for survival. Thus project planning is a thought-provoking area to study and research. Conventional theory emphasizes personal traits and leadership of a project manager who is usually also the project planner and recommends "Bottom-Up" approach for project scheduling and budgeting, which do not seem to correlate completely with the research results. The scope of this study focuses on non-profit organization like Company X that is dependent on project funding. The case study collected first-hand information from a real-life story with two funding-application failures. I have observed that stakeholders, scheduling and budgeting are the most principle dimensions for project planning, in particular for non-profit organizations. Accordingly, research questions were structured from these three perspectives. Interview to project managers with years of experience was conducted, data was collected and analyzed. The findings have shown that network of project planners are rather important for establishing efficient consortium and improve the success rate of project proposals. It is thereby meaningful to provide external support on network enhancement. More streamlined information flow and cooperation amongst organizations in Turku region is suggested. However, the feasibility of optimizing the communication and collaboration between non-profit organizations in terms of project planning in a regional context remains to be further studied in the future.

Projects have become the de facto method of implementing business strategy and operations. As such, understanding how projects relate to business strategy and managing projects strategically is increasingly important to effective and efficient business management. This book is designed as a short and concise treatise on how to go about doing that. We start by figuring out how the project relates to the rest of the business and environment and what separates it from other projects and functions. We then discuss how the reader can use principles of strategic management to better organize and manage the various projects that they deal with on a daily basis so that they are strategic in nature. In essence we show how to approach answering the important strategic questions in project management like "Why is the project being implemented? How does the project relate to the major strategic goals of the organization? How do we accomplish the performance goals for the project so that they help achieve the major strategic goals of the organization?"

Project managers leading international projects must deliver value and align the project outcomes to the wider strategic goals of the organization. However, they are faced with the challenges of cross cultural communication and behavioural differences, large-scale and technically complex projects involving multiple stakeholders, and slow decision making when speed is of the essence. Leading International Projects helps overcome these challenges by taking a holistic approach, drawing on systemic, behavioural and psychological perspectives to build team trust, communicate to avoid misunderstanding and conflict, and identify and minimize risk of derailment. It provides a practical toolbox for successfully managing international projects. Leading International Projects provides case studies from experienced project professionals working internationally, each offering deep insights into the challenges of cross-border projects and practical ideas on how to lead successfully. It presents the experiences of consultants and senior project management professionals and their reflections on projects that they ran. Practical guidance on managing the complex dynamics of international projects is provided through individual, team and organizational diagnostic and development tools.
