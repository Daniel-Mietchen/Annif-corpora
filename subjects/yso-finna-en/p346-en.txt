The Worldwide review of bottom fisheries in the high seas provides states and other interested parties with a summary of the current status of high seas bottom fisheries worldwide based on the best information available, including responses to an FAO questionnaire sent to high seas fishing states, the European Community and relevant regional fisheries management organizations. It contains reviews of bottom fisheries in the high seas in the following regions: the North East and North West Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the South East and South West Atlantic, the North and South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. Fisheries are described in terms of fleets, catch and effort, and main species caught, with due consideration being given to the location of fishing activities. This document was prepared in response to the request by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) and related consideration of the issue of bottom fisheries on the high seas by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 61/105 on Sustainable Fisheries adopted in December 2006. It also aims at assisting in the implementation of the FAO International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas by providing background information and highlighting gaps in the available data. According to the findings of this review, 285 vessels were active in the high seas bottom fisheries worldwide in 2006. The total catch of this fleet has been estimated to about 250 000 tonnes valued at EUR 450 million (landed value). For various reasons discussed in the report, these are to be considered minimal estimates.
