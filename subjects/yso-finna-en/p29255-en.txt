The main aim of this thesis has been to give the reader fisrt of all a general knowledge of the main concepts that are contained within it, such as internationalization, exporting and the Spanish market. This is an objective decided together with the commissioner InnoConnections with the aim of being able to find export organizations based in Madrid and that are interested in working in the Nordic / Finnish market. The process of researching has not been simple, and also it has not lead to the expected results, which were to be able to contact with at least a few organizations and obtain some feedback from them. Most intents of making contact with the given organizations have received no feedback, leading to a series of conclusions that point to the fact that this particular period in time may not be the best to approach the Spanish market, as it is affected by a strong economic crisis which makes all businesses fearful of putting at risk any of their assets. However, these findings may still be useful to the commissioner as well as other businesses planning to approach such market, as they give an insight to how Spanish companies are actually reacting to this difficult situation and therefore gives the opportunity to businesses to possibly look for other options when trying to internationalize or look for Spanish customers, as at this point in time they are companies that are being very cautious and that may not be willing to extend to other countries as this is often considered risky.
