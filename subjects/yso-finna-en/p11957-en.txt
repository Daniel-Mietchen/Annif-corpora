Investigations done at an old sawmill site found high levels of PCDD/F (Dioxin) contamination. As the area has been allocated as a residential development, remediation of the site has been started, which involves the excavation of contaminated soil and transporting it to landfill sites. The purpose of this work is to clarify the concept of dioxin contamination in soil and review different remediation techniques available for dioxin contaminated soil. A-Insinöörit requested a study that would assist the company in making decisions that will provide their customers with the best possible options in this regard. The study was based on a number of different researches done in Finland and Internationally on dioxin contamination and the different remediation techniques currently in use or in development. While landfilling is the most common and economical remediation solution in currently in use, Mecanochemical treatment was identified as the treatment with the most potential for the future and it's development needs to be followed closely. Landfilling is still the best option for the company at this time, but the fact that the soil contamination is just relocated and still present in landfills, means that a permanent treatment will still be required to eliminate the dangers associated with dioxin toxicity in future.

Chelating Agents for Land Decontamination Technologies examines the application of chelating agents for the treatment of soil contaminated with metals. Contaminated land remediation is a widespread and costly problem, and the traditional excavation-and-disposal treatment method is not a sustainable solution.  Chelating agents (organic compounds that can bind metal ions) are an attractive new technology for land decontamination, because chelating agents enhance metal extraction from contaminated soil or sediment and facilitate metal mobility in subsurface soils. Chapters in this book cover the process fundamentals as well as engineering applications and recent advances for the use of chelating agents in soil washing, soil flushing, phytoremediation, and electrokinetic remediation. They address the application of chelating agents for both ex situ and in situ soil remediation technologies. The extensive use of illustrations and summary tables is combined with up-to-date references. This compilation of engineering applications and research findings for different chelating agent–enhanced remediation technologies will be useful to environmental engineers, scientists, and decision makers regarding contaminated land remediation.

Electrocoagulation (EC) is an emerging technology that combines the functions and advantages of conventional coagulation, flotation, and electrochemistry in water and wastewater treatment. The aims of this work included doing an updated literary review of recent feasible applications of EC, which were found to be plentiful. Since the economic and practical operational key figures related to EC haven’t been extensively mapped out before, this was a prime objective of this part of the work.The aim of the next part of this work was to find new feasible applications for EC in the treatment of water and wastewater. The studied wastewaters included bio- and synthetic oil-in-water emulsions, various industrial nutrient-containing wastewaters, and peat bog drainage water containing humic substances (an interesting and topical problem, especially in Finland). These studies proved the feasibility of EC. In addition, larger-scale experiments were also conducted successfully, thus proving the scalability of the EC process. Extensive economic analyses of the studied EC applications were also done. The operational costs and energy consumption of EC were found to be very low—typically about 0.1–1.0 €/m3 and 0.4–4.0 kWh/m3.It has been forecasted that in the future there will be a shortage of virgin phosphorus. Therefore, another essential purpose of this work was to conduct a preliminary study on the feasibility of using EC for nutrient (especially phosphorus, but also nitrogen) removal and recovery from different types of real wastewater. Specifically, it may be possible to use EC sludges containing notable amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen as additives in granulated bio ash-based fertilizer products for various applications. This is a novel idea and a “hot topic” in the waste utilization sector and in circular and bioeconomy.^

Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.
