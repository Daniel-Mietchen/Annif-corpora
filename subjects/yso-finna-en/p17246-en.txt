Designed as a companion to ACSM's "Guidelines for exercise testing and prescription," seventh edition, and as a recommended study tool for ACSM certifications, this book covers all the major aspects of preventive rehabilitative and fitness programs and the main points from all position stands of the American College of Sports Medicine. It provides readers with the necessary background information to address the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) set forth in ACSM's Guidelines. New topics covered and those with increased emphasis include assessment of physical activity, applied exercise programming, arthritic diseases and conditions, neuromuscular diseases and exercise, and more

Perceived work ability and physical capacity of home care workers : effects of the physical exercise and ergonomic intervention on factors related to work ability
Kids love to move and it is proven that children learn academic concepts better when those concepts are combined with music and movement. So Debby Mitchell created a book and DVD package that includes video clips that combine learning with music and movement. The DVD also includes reproducible assessments, lyrics, and posters that can be used in the classroom to facilitate learning.

Easy to administer and score, the Senior Fitness Test is a simple method of assessing the physical attributes that older adults need in order to perform daily activities. Health practitioners and fitness and rehabilitation specialists who work with older adults will be able to identify weaknesses that cause mobility problems, set fitness goals and develop exercise programmes that help clients and patients improve mobility and maintain physical independence. The new edition contains expanded information on ways to modify test protocols for older adults with limiting conditions such as osteoporosis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, stroke, fibromyalgia, heart conditions, multiple sclerosis, hip and knee replacements, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis and blindness or low vision. It now comes with a DVD containing visual demonstrations of the tests, including setup, execution, evaluation and modification of testing protocols to accommodate clients' limitations.

"In this fifth edition of Principles of Exercise Testing and Interpretation, as in earlier editions, we attempt to develop conceptual advances in the physiology and pathophysiology of exercise, particularly as related to the practice of medicine. The underlying theme of the book continues to be the recognition that the most important requirement for exercise performance is transport of oxygen to support the bioenergetic processes in the muscle cells (including, of course, the heart) and elimination of the carbon dioxide formed as a byproduct of exercise metabolism. Thus, appropriate cardiovascular and ven- tilatory responses are required to match those of muscle respiration in meeting the energy demands of exercise. As depicted by the logo on the book cover, normal exercise performance requires an efficient coupling of external to internal (cellular) respiration. Appropriate treatment of exercise intolerance requires that patients' symptoms be thought of in terms of a gas exchange defect between the cell and the environment. The defect may be in the lungs, heart, peripheral or pulmonary circulations, the muscles themselves, or there may be a combination of defects. Thus, we describe the pathophysiology in gas transport and exchange that affect any site in the cardio- respiratory coupling between the lungs and the muscles. We illustrate how cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide the means for a critical evaluation by the clinician-scientist of the functional competency of each component in the coupling of cellular to external respiration, including the cardiovascular system. To achieve this, clinical cases are used to illustrate the wide spectrum of pathophysiology capable of causing exercise intolerance"--Provided by publisher.
