Plant adaptation to temperature and photoperiod
Genetic and environmental control of flowering in wild and cultivated strawberries
Abstract.
Quantification of photoperiodic effects on growth of Phleum pratense = Funksjonelle sammenhenger mellom daglengde og vekst hos timotei
Adaptation to growing season length in the perennial <em>Arabidopsis lyrata</em>
Photoperiodism : the biological calendar
Effect of accumulated duration of the light period on bud burst in Norway spruce (Picea abies) of varying ages
Photoperiodism in plants
Transfer of florigenic stimuli between tillers in photoperiodically split plants of Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis
Photosynthesis and growth of selected Scotch pine populations
Molecular control of the yearly growth cycle in wild strawberry
Frost hardening and risk of a second flush in Norway spruce seedlings after an early-season short-day treatment
Experiments on the joint effect of heat sum and photoperiod on seedlings of Betula pendula
Adaptation to growing season length in the perennial Arabidopsis lyrata
Regulation of flowering and canopy structure in timothy (Phleum pratense L.)
Metabolism of gibberellin A19 is under photoperiodic control in Populus, Salix and Betula, but not in daylength-insensitive Populus overexpressing phytochrome A
Regulation of strawberry growth and development
Crown branching and cropping potential in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) can be enhanced by daylength treatments
