"This book deploys a relational analysis to theorize disability at the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality within both U.S. and global contexts. Critically engaging post humanist theories of difference this book explores the implications of re-theorizing disability as a materialist construct in the context of global citizenship. The book engages a diversity of theories and topics that include transnational feminist theory, critical race feminism, post humanist and marxist theories of embodiment , special education as the post colonial ghetto, sex educational policies, citizenship and cognitive disability, war and disability, and the dialectical tensions within an ethics of care"--

"This book should be read by everyone who wants to understand special education today. James M. Kauffman, Ed.D, Professor Emeritus of Education, University of Virginia. New Perspectives in Special Education opens the door to the fascinating and vitally important world of theory that informs contemporary special education. It examines theoretical and philosophical orientations such as 'positivism', 'poststructuralism' and 'hermeneutics', relating these to contemporary global views of special education. Offering a refreshingly balanced view across a broad range of debates, this topical text guides the reader through the main theoretical and philosophical positions that may be held with regard to special education, and critically examines positions that often go unrecognised and unquestioned by practitioners and academics alike. It helps the reader to engage with and question the positions taken by themselves and others, by providing thinking points and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. Perspectives covered include: Positivism and empiricism Phenomenology and hermeneutics Historical materialism and critical theory Holism and constructivism Structuralism and post structuralism Pragmatism and symbolic interactionism Psychoanalysis Postmodernism and historical epistemology Anyone wishing to gain a fuller understanding of special education should not be without this stimulating and much-needed text"--

Combining surveys of the careers and figures including Tom Nairn and Alasdair MacIntyre with assessments of important works like Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities and Isaac Deutscher's biography of Trotsky, and ranging in time from the legacy of Adam Smith to Naomi Klein's analysis of neoliberalism, Davidson argues for a self-reflective form of historical materialism as a necessary intellectual component of the struggle for human liberation"--P.
