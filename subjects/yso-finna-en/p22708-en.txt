The case company wanted to know what social media channels they should use and how, and in addition which channels are their competitors using and how. The theory framework defines basics of marketing communication and marketing communication in social media. Also the most important social media’s channels from the case company’s point of view are being viewed. The theory part is based on both literary and digital sources. Most of the sources are digital due to the modern and constantly developing topic. There were two researches implemented. A qualitative observation was made in order to find out how the case company and its competitors are using their social media channels and a quantitative web-based survey was implemented in order to find out social media’s users’ customs and opinions. Main results were that at the moment the case company is using their social media very competitively when compared to the competitors and that the case company should have an official Facebook page and they should also direct their content on social media more to the way that social media users are hoping.
