This thesis was commissioned by Nokia Networks as a part of a wider ongoing quality project. The main objective for this thesis and the quality project was to improve diagnostic accuracy on a certain base station product by targeting the most misdiagnosed faults and to reduce unnecessary component replacement. To achieve the objective, an early version of an automated diagnostic tool was developed. The tool was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio and C# programming language. The tool uses diagnostic databases to hold diagnostic information. The diagnostic databases were implemented using XML (Extensible Markup Language). The diagnostic databases implement fault models and rule based diagnostics to troubleshoot target products. Two pilot programs were launched in order to verify the functionality of the tool and measure improvements on diagnostic accuracy. The results of the pilots were encouraging; the rate of failed diagnoses decreased by 88%. The success of the pilot programs and the ease of use of the tool sparked interest to it, and it was decided to be taken into global use in system module repair of Nokia Networks base stations. Further development is, however, still needed to extend the coverage of the tool and to add new features.

"Welcome to the third edition of Diagnostic Imaging: Spine. Five years have passed since the second edition, and 11 years have flown by since the first edition was published. This edition is a refresh with new images, new diagnoses, and updated text and references. The same excellent Amirsys formatting is present, with individual diagnoses capable of standing alone but with a logical integration within the larger sections. The Key Facts box retains its visual prominence at the beginning of each diagnosis, allowing for a quick scan of the most important bullet points when time is short (and when is it not?). The text format remains in the hallmark Diagnostic Imaging bulleted form that allows a large amount of important information to be displayed in an easy-to-use and inviting layout. Prose text chapters are included for the introduction to major sections, which are color coded, and the use of tables allows quick scanning for important data and measurements."--From the publisher.

Handbook of Gender and Sexuality in Psychological Assessment brings together two interrelated realms: psychological assessment with gender and sexuality. This handbook aids in expanding the psychological assessors' knowledge and skill when considering how gender and sexuality shapes the client's and the assessor's experiences. Throughout the six sections, gender and sexuality are discussed in their relation to different psychological methods of assessment; various psychological disorders; special considerations for children, adolescents, and older adults; important training and ethical considerations; as well as several in-depth case discussions.

Expansion and intensification of global trade in horticultural plants has increased the risk of spread of new alien pathogen species in the EU. Alien species of pathogenic viruses and viroids in horticultural plants have been introduced into Finland in infected plant material (plants, seedlings, cuttings, tubers, seeds). By 1997, about 30 virus species of horticultural plants had been detected in Finland. We aimed at compiling emerging new virus and viroid records during 1997-2010. Eight new viruses belonging to tospo-, potex-, poty-, tymo-, ilar- and allexiviruses were detected in horticultural plants: four occurred in greenhouse crops, two in vegetables and two in garden ornamentals outdoors. Five new findings of viroids were made in ornamental and vegetable greenhouse crops during 2008-2009. More rapid and accurate diagnostic methods have contributed to identifying new alien pathogens. Global trade seems to be the main reason for the introduction of the newest virus and viroid pathogens into Finland.

"Lippincott's Primary Care Musculoskeletal Radiology helps family practitioners, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants identify and diagnose patient injuries based on the radiologic findings that are most seen in the office setting. The book emphasizes what tests to order when and shows side by side images of what is normal and what is abnormal. Each chapter follows a consistent format: Clinical Presentation, Mechanism of Injury, Patient Assessment, What to Order, Not to Be Missed, Radiographic Evaluation, Treatment, and When to Refer. An anatomical wall chart for the office is also included. A companion website includes fully searchable text, an image bank, and patient education handouts"--Provided by publisher.
