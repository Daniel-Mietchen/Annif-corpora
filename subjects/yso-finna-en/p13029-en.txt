Making pop-up greeting cards
Today's travellers are increasingly knowledgeable and independent than before. More and more leisure travellers are willing to hold the "steering wheel" of entire trip by themselves and pay more attention to high values.    Helsinki's hotel industry has experienced steady growth in the recent years. Research shows that most of the leisure tourists who have been travelled in Helsinki are interested in having a longer stay to experience the local life style. In fact, the average hotel stay in Helsinki is always less than two nights in the past.    Based on the trend in international leisure tourism and the development of Helsinki hotel industry, the author has created a promotion for hotels to attract independent leisure travellers to have a minimum two nights' stay.     The primary goal of the project is to create a promotional product for hotels to promote their accommodation sales to independent travelers. The project aims to bring a new concept of utilizing hotels' current resources and local network to increase its room revenue through its self-owned sales channels and networks.     The project is completed between the end of 2008 and March 2009. The evaluation result shows that discounts and extra benefits will affect travelers' decision on length of stay. But the determinant factor of independent leisure travelers' length of stay is not about the extra benefits or discounts. A more competitive marketing plan should be developed around this promotion idea.
