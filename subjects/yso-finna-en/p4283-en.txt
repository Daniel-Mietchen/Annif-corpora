Hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities and polycystic ovary syndrome:impact on female reproductive and metabolic health from early adulthood until menopause
Congenital cryptorchidism : prevalence, endocrinology and treatment
Sexual and reproductive well-being has gained recognition as a basic right, enshrined in international law. Yet reality on the ground is different, as society, health programmes and aid agencies are all entrenched in old ways. Fundamental shifts in thinking and practice are needed to realize these rights and transform these realities. This book portrays a wide range of innovative examples from around the world. From popular theatre in Nigeria to participatory research in Britain, from role-playing in Cambodia to visualizing reproductive health in Zimbabwe and from collaborative planning in Egypt to community dialogue in the Andes, these twenty four chapters reveal the value of transforming approaches to sexual reproductive well-being. All begin with the need to engage women, men and youth more directly in determining pathways to change; and all highlight both the complexities and the possibilities of making rights real.

This report demonstrates the relationship between sexual health, human rights and the law. Drawing from a review of public health evidence and extensive research into human rights law at international, regional and national levels, the report shows how states in different parts of the world can and do support sexual health through legal and other mechanisms that are consistent with human rights standards and their own human rights obligations.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder of women of reproductive age, affecting 5–18% of them. Menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenemia and obesity are key features in PCOS and they are suggested to be the most important metabolic risks linked to PCOS, but their respective roles are still under debate. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is involved in sexual differentiation and follicle growth and its level is increased in women with PCOS.The aims of this project were to clarify the significance of menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenemia and serum levels of AMH in adolescence as predictive factors of the syndrome and to investigate the respective roles of obesity and hyperandrogenism as metabolic risk factors in women with PCOS from adolescence to late adulthood.The study populations were the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (N=3373 women) and a Nordic population including 1553 women with PCOS and 448 controls.At the age of 16 years, women with menstrual irregularities were more hyperandrogenic compared with women with normal menstrual cycles. Serum AMH levels correlated positively with those of testosterone at this age. They were higher in adolescents with menstrual irregularities compared with those with regular cycles and in women with hirsutism or PCOS at the age of 26 years. However, AMH was not a good marker of metabolic abnormalities in adolescence or a reliable tool to predict PCOS in later life. Androgen levels were higher in women with PCOS throughout life compared with controls. The parameters that best predicted PCOS at all ages were the free androgen index, and androstenedione. Women with PCOS exhibited increased abdominal obesity, altered insulin metabolism, worse lipid profiles and higher blood pressure from early adulthood until menopause compared with controls. The highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome was detected in obese and hyperandrogenic women with PCOS.In conclusion, irregular menstrual cycles, identified by a simple question at adolescence, represent a good marker of hyperandrogenemia, later metabolic risks and development of PCOS. Due to the persistence of hyperandrogenism and metabolic alterations, the treatment of PCOS should be focused on prevention and treatment of these problems as early as in adolescence in order to decrease future morbidity.

Unintended pregnancy among currently pregnant maried women in Nepal
There is a lack of studies on the association between labour force participation and abortion. This study examined how the likelihood of having an abortion depends on being employed, unemployed, student or outside the workforce using Finnish register data from three birth cohorts (born in 1955-59, 1965-69 and 1975-79) of nearly 260,000 women. The results differed depending on whether all women or only pregnant women were studied and on the cohort analysed. Unemployed women had a high likelihood of abortion when all women were studied, but among pregnant women students had the highest likelihood. The direction and strength of the association varied by relationship status, age, and parity. The results show that the likelihood of abortion depends on women's economic position. More studies on contraceptive use and pregnancy intentions in Finland are needed to identify the mechanisms behind these findings.

In collaboration with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), this timely volume provides a comprehensive review on all areas of breast cancer survivorship research, highlighting research that is underway or in development. The range of topics covered include the biology and management of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction on breast cancer survivorship, the biology and management of Neuropathy and Arthralgias, the ongoing research on the biology of diet and lifestyle interventions in survivors, and more. With the tremendous growth in the number of breast cancer survivors, researchers have moved beyond describing the outcomes of breast cancer treatments and are focusing their research on understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of the late effects of breast cancer treatment, as well as the development and evaluation of interventions to mitigate some of the persistent symptomstopics which are also explored in this volume. In addition, current research on how to improve survivorship and reduce recurrence of breast cancer through behavioral and lifestyle modifications is also discussed.
