"Inspired by the social theories of Max Weber, David d'Avray asks how far medieval religion was rational and, in doing so, proposes a new approach to the study of the medieval past. Applying ideas developed in his companion volume on Rationalities in History, he explores how values, instrumental calculation, legal formality and substantive rationality interact and the ways in which medieval beliefs were strengthened by their mutual connections, by experience, and by mental images. He sheds new light on key themes and figures in medieval religion ranging from conversion, miracles and the ideas of Bernard of Clairvaux to Trinitarianism, papal government and Francis of Assisi's charismatic authority. This book is unique in showing how values and instrumental calculation affect each other in practice and demonstrating the ways in which the application of social theory can be used to generate fresh empirical research as well as new historical insights"--

The corrections
This thesis was developed in order to help the commissionaire, the Microscopy and Nanotechnology Centre at Oulu University (MNT), acquire a better understanding of the current state of the market for material analyses services in Northern Bothnia region. The main purpose of this research paper is, by using applied marketing research tools- a quantitative survey, to collect as much information possible about the customers who are purchasing material analyses in the region. The main research areas have been value creation and customers’ satisfaction, regular customer behaviour and information channels used in the purchasing process. The background analyses included a theory review of B2B marketing and the organizational behaviour in specific. Moreover a SME framework has been drawn, also the buying behaviour in organizations and the value creation has been discussed to provide to the reader a theoretical fundament for the research to come. The conveyed survey managed to successfully attract respondents in order to provide valid answers to the preliminary objectives. The main conclusions have been made in reference with the building ideal material analyses service and in considerations with the future trends on the market. A material service provider that is fast, reliable, cooperative, versatile and experienced has been stated to be the most desired research partner. Furthermore, as outsourcing seems to be the future trend in the area, the importance of heterogenic service provider has been described. There is still a demand for further analyses in the area of start-up material analyses research and the exploration of the decision making in regards with buying behaviour.
