aThis book presents contemporary information on mutagenesis in plants and its applications in plant breeding and research. The topics are classified into sections focusing on the concepts, historical development and genetic basis of plant mutation breeding (chapters 1-6); mutagens and induced mutagenesis (chapters 7-13); mutation induction and mutant development (chapters 14-23); mutation breeding (chapters 24-34); or mutations in functional genomics (chapters 35-41). This book is an essential reference for those who are conducting research on mutagenesis as an approach to improving or modifying a trait, or achieving basic understanding of a pathway for a trait.
