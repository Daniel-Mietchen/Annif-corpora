Architecture principles : the cornerstones of enterprise architecture
Since the early times of travelling architecture does constitute an important force of attraction and a vital element in marketing. Until today destinations try to increase their market positions by means of the development and restoration of the built environment. However, architecture is characterised by an enduring presence with impacts on visitors and residents alike. Hence, on a sustainable basis it needs to chime with place and situation. Where modesty might be suitable for one destination, spectacular architecture could be a transformation catalyst or unique selling proposition for another. Destination developers have to be aware of the local requirements as well as the reciprocal relationship between the modern practice of tourism and the built environment. To address the complexity of architectural tourism, throughout the book this topic is subject of a controversial discussion and approached with a contextual and interdisciplinary view.

In practice, requirements engineering tasks become more and more complex. In order to ensure a high level of knowledge and training, the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB) worked out the training concept Certified Professional for Requirements EngineeringA", which defines a requirements engineer's practical skills on different training levels. The book covers the different subjects of the curriculum for the Certified Professional for Requirements EngineeringA" (CPRE) defined by the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB). It supports its readers in preparing for the test to achieve the Foundation LevelA" of the CPRE.
