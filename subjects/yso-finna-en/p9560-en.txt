During the thesis project, a web browser based application was designed, implemented and tested as an assignment of Finnish software company Innofactor Ltd. The result of the thesis is an information system, which is used by Innofactor ltd to enhance the customer services process. The implementation and planning includes efficient usage of existing controls and classes of the Innofactor Prime Platform and therefore minimizing the unnecessary repetition of source code. The main techniques used to implement the application are .NET Framework, ASP.NET AND Microsoft SQL Server. The application follows the n-tier structure of Innofactor Prime Platform. The source material used in the thesis project was Innofactor's technical documentation. The result of the thesis along with the fully functional customer service's information system is the project documentation and the final report. The information system was successfully taken into use at Innofactor intranet at September 2008. After the testing was completed, it was determined that the new information system fulfils the set demands and it provides a good platform to develop the system further.
