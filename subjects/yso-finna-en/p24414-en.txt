This volume offers a comprehensive guide on the theory and practice of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) for handling challenges associated with poorly soluble drugs. In twenty-three inclusive chapters, the book examines thermodynamics and kinetics of the amorphous state and amorphous solid dispersions, ASD technologies, excipients for stabilizing amorphous solid dispersions such as polymers, and ASD manufacturing technologies, including spray drying, hot melt extrusion, fluid bed layering and solvent-controlled micro-precipitation technology (MBP). Each technology is illustrated by specific case studies. In addition, dedicated sections cover analytical tools and technologies for characterization of amorphous solid dispersions, the prediction of long-term stability, and the development of suitable dissolution methods and regulatory aspects. The book also highlights future technologies on the horizon, such as supercritical fluid processing, mesoporous silica, KinetiSol℗ʼ, and the use of non-salt-forming organic acids and amino acids for the stabilization of amorphous systems. Amorphous Solid Dispersions: Theory and Practice is a valuable reference to pharmaceutical scientists interested in developing bioavailable and therapeutically effective formulations of poorly soluble molecules in order to advance these technologies and develop better medicines for the future.℗

This book contains essential knowledge on the preparation, control, logistics, dispensing, and use of medicines. It features chapters written by experienced pharmacists working in hospitals and academia throughout Europe, complete with practical examples as well as information on current EU-legislation. From prescription to production, from usage instructions to procurement and the impact of medicines on the environment, the book provides step-by-step coverage that will help a wide range of readers. It offers product knowledge for all pharmacists working directly with patients, and it will enable them to make the appropriate medicine available, to store medicines properly, to adapt medicines if necessary, and to dispense medicines with the appropriate information to inform patients and caregivers about product care and how to maintain their quality. This basic knowledge will also be of help to industrial pharmacists to remind and focus them on the application of the medicines manufactured. The basic and practical knowledge on the design, preparation and quality management of medicines can directly be applied by the pharmacists whose main duty is production in community and hospital pharmacies and industries. Undergraduate as well as graduate pharmacy students will find knowledge and backgrounds in a fully coherent way and fully supported with examples.
