Learning professionals are finding success applying game-based sensibilities to the development of instruction. This is the first book to show how to design online instruction that leverages the best elements of online games to increase learning, retention, and application. It explains how to match different game strategies to types of learning content for the right learning outcome and discusses how gamification techniques can be used in a variety of settings to improve learning, retention and application of knowledge. Supported by peer-reviewed studies and examples from corporations who have adopted game-based learning successfully, the book illustrates how combining instructional design thinking with game concepts can create engaged and interactive learning experiences across a variety of media, from online to face-to-face.

A guide to authentic E-learning
Abstract: The project goal was to provide the PHP software programming course materials, for a company called Viope Solutions Oy and to develop an Eclipse plug-in for the collaboration of Eclipse editor and their server. In this paper, the concept of E-learning system is briefly discussed, and the company's current system is also demonstrated along with the PHP course material that was developed for it. Demonstrating a plug-in that was developed for facilitating this system is also the other purpose. The development of plug-in was proved to be of great importance, because it helps users of this system to use the widely used Eclipse editor to perform programming exercises. The application, therefore, should improve the popularity of the company and increase their efficiency. The proposed solution is based on our experience as students on the editor and on the fact that it is a well known one. By the help of this project, it was proved that it is possible to integrate the Eclipse editor with the current system by developing a plug-in for it, which in turn yields a great result.

Virtual courses on sustainable development in Baltic universities : considerations and recommendations for action
In recent years, technological advancements have enabled higher-learning institutions to offer millions of independent learners the opportunity to participate in open-access online courses. As this practice expands, drawing considerable media attention, questions continue to arise regarding pedagogical methodology and the long-term viability of open learning. Furthering Higher Education Possibilities through Massive Open Online Courses seeks to provide a space for discussion of MOOCs: what they mean for the learning process, how they are redefining the concept of a classroom, and what effects they may have on the role of teachers. Featuring emerging research on a variety of topics relating to distance education, informal learning, as well as educational costs and funding, this book is aimed at teachers, administrators, business professionals, and designers of both curricular resources and e-classroom technology.
