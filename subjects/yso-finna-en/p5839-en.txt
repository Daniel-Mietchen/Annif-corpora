A new discovery of a little sort of people, anciently discoursed of, called Pygmies: with a particular description of their religion and government, language, habit, stature, food, [et]c. Their remarkable affability and generosity to strangers; the age they commonly arrive at; their abhorrence of riches and deceit; their wonderful skill in the sciences; their grandeur and magnificence of the court; and the elegance of their temples, castles, and other publick buildings. By the rev.d Joshua Barnes, late regius professor of the Greek language in the University of Cambridge; editor of Homer, Euripides, &c. &c
