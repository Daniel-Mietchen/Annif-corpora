This study focuses on practices of engagement and representation in North-South international partnerships, and in global and development education in Finland. The first objective was approached through a qualitative methodology involving document analyses, and interviews with northern and southern partners engaged in education sector partnerships in Zambia from 2003 to 2007. The second objective discusses challenges and possibilities for more ethical North-South partnerships in global and development education policies in Finland. This doctoral study report consists of four articles and a thesis summary. This study draws on three fields of scholarship: postcolonial studies, development studies and global and development education studies. Postcolonial theory is used selectively as a ‘tool for thinking’ that connects critical examinations of North-South engagements and representations with educational possibilities. The methodological framework consists of a combination of different qualitative methods including ethnography and content analysis of three sets of data: 1) 19 semi-structured theme interviews, 2) five open-ended narrative interviews and 3) selected Finnish global and development education policy documents. In the analysis of structures, narratives and relationships in educational partnerships in Zambia, this study outlines tensions and paradoxes that point to the need for more ethical practices that can move beyond hegemonic, ethnocentric and paternalistic patterns of representation and engagement in international development work. The study concludes that ethical engagements in North-South education sector partnerships require an approach that goes beyond individual skills, knowledge and competencies. The importance of systemic analyses of power and knowledge production, of acknowledging the historical and cultural referents that frame possibilities of understanding, and of acknowledging the complexities that are present in North-South engagements are emphasized. Furthermore, the importance of self-reflexivity is suggested as a starting point for understanding the limits of universalised forms of knowing to support ethical engagements.

Emotions and social relations
Offers a new framework for understanding and raising children based on self-regulation -- the process by which a child (or indeed a parent) can get 'in the zone' -- a receptive state of calm alertness that allows you to approach any task in a state of balance. Learning the art of self-regulation can help children learn to deal with experiences, overcome frustration, learn to pay better attention, control impulses, engage better with others and learn about the world. Hundreds of thousands of children who have gone through the programme have shown significant improvement in literacy, numeracy and behaviour. Now, his groundbreaking research is being published for the first time in this timely and practical guide for parents.
