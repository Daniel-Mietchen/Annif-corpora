The purpose of this thesis was to analyse existing theories on branding and suggest an appropriate branding strategy for Voimo Company. The objective was to develop a practical branding model and then apply it to Voimo Company. The question to answer is how a company of any size, with a special consideration for a small one, can stand out from the crowd and survive in today̕ s competitive environment, how to build a recognizable brand. The theoretical framework was based on existing literature about branding and branding models. Most of the theories of branding models are processed based (Aaker 1996, Knapp 2000, and Gad 2001). The branding model developed during the study was based on theoretical framework and consists of five steps: delegating, researching and developing the essence of data, communicating and the follow-up process. Each step was then applied to Voimo Company. The research method was qualitative. In addition, data was gathered through interviews. In order to draw comparison between the opinions, both the owner of the company and Voimo̕ s customers were interviewed. The interviews were analysed qualitatively. The results revealed that the model developed for Voimo Company is feasible and the company has been able to go through each step of the branding process. Having completed the internal and external market analysis Voimo was able to better develop a brand idea, formulate brand promise and determine what business it is in, from the consumer̕ s point of view. It became clear that to make sure the brand is unique, Voimo needed to come up with an authentically different meaning for it but yet simple to understand. In conclusion, in order to sustain in the competitive environment companies of any size, but especially small companies, should and can plan and manage their branding process regardless of their financial situation.  If applied well, a small business can find benefits that matter to customers and are different from those of competitors and thus have a clear advantage over large companies due to their more flexible structure and process. In addition, Internet provides numerous options for SME to build its own community through different social media networks and that way start building awareness and bond with a target audience is a lot less expensive than conventional approach. What is needed is knowledge and understanding of the value of having a known brand and means and tools necessary for implementation.
