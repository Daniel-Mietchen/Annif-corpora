As teachers around the world deal with the challenges of inclusive education, they must endeavour to find effective ways of enhancing their classroom teaching methods. What Really Works in Special and Inclusive Education presents special educational needs teachers with a range of evidence-based strategies they can immediately put into practice in their classrooms. This unique book will be invaluable to any teacher in the field with neither the time nor the inclination to engage with theory-heavy research, but with a desire to ensure that their teaching strategies are up-to-the-minute and proven to be the most effective best practices. Each of the 26 strategies that this book comprises has a substantial research base, a strong theoretical rationale and clear guidelines on their implementation, as well as cautionary advice where necessary. In this new second edition, David Mitchell, a leading writer in special and inclusive education, continues to break new ground with revised and updated strategies based on evidence from the most recent studies in the field. From the myriad of related research available, only those studies with genuine potential for improving the practices of teachers and schools have been included, with the aim of facilitating practitioners in providing high-quality learning and social outcomes for all. Updates to this new edition include: An even wider international focus, including evidence drawn from the Far East New chapters on Response to Intervention, School-wide strategies, and the Finnish Education System A new companion website, with extra case studies and links to further reading, journal articles and video For anyone with a vocational or academic interest in evidence-based special educational needs teaching strategies – whether student or qualified classroom teacher, teacher trainer, educational psychologist, special needs coordinator, consultant or researcher – this book will be essential reading.
Design of a virtual learning environment for students with special needs
Creative learning for inclusion : creative approaches to meet special needs in the classroom
A critical look at four high-prevalence mild disabilities as seen from several unique perspectives. Learners with Mild Disabilities focuses on four high-prevalence disorders: mild intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, emotional/behavioral disorders, and ADHD. The text also considers the Autism Spectrum Disorders, such as HFA and Asperger's Syndrome, in addition to other mild conditions such as communication disorders. This text looks first at the concept of disability from conventional categorical perspectives, and then shifts to focusing on learners from the perspective of alternative, non-categorical frameworks. It describes students with disabilities and related conditions with respect to a variety of individual strengths and needs, considering their cognitive, perceptual, language, academic learning, and social/emotional characteristics.

An attitude and approach for teaching music to special learners
Educating exceptional children in regular classrooms
This book condenses everything the mainstream teacher needs to know about Special Educational Needs into one short volume, allowing them to pick and choose teaching methods that suit them and each individual student. Following a revolutionary 'a la carte' concept, the book acts first and foremost as a teaching menu, offering a variety of options that teachers can use as they see fit. Written in a jargon-free, accessible style, the author gets to the heart of issues associated with teaching mixed ability classes, offering more flexible alternatives to traditional teaching strategies and suggesting helpful approaches that really work. Maintaining that teachers are usually far more capable of handling situations than they believe themselves to be, the book allows them to choose methods that suit their own personal style and the specific needs of their students. Essential background information on special educational needs including dyslexia, dyspraxia, Asperger's Syndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is included throughout. Combining practical methodology with factual information about learning difficulties, this guide will be an invaluable resource for non-specialist teachers supporting children with special educational needs in inclusive classrooms.

Working with Hannah : a special girl in a mainstream school
Creative Learning to Meet Special Needs explores the crucial role that creativity can play in inclusive education. It outlines a number of practical challenges faced by teachers working in both mainstream and special schools and the conceptual issues which frame successful learning for young people with special needs. It practically shows teachers examples of how to use creativity in the curriculum, and also how to engage with and support the learning of pupils with special educational needs in a way that will substantially impact their school experiences and later lives. This book collects together six accounts of creative approaches to meet special needs. These case studies are written by teachers and creative practitioners, each one considering a different theme: - the importance of location and context - early years - sustainability of practice - the assessment of learning - creative uses of technology - student participation. Describing the different ways in which a creative approach can help pupils with SEN access the curriculum, with activities and practical materials for teachers, this book will explain: - Why creativity is central to making the curriculum accessible - How to use personalised learning with pupils with SEN - How to promote achievements and motivation through creative experiences - How the curriculum can be extended and represented in innovative ways for pupils with SEN - How to use interactive methods of teaching and alternative methods of communication.
