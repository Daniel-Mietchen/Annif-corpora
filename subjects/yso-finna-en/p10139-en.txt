The effects of unemployment on mortality following workplace downsizing and workplace closure : a register-biased follow-up study of Finnish men and women during economic boom and recession
Why are there so few women engineers, technicians and craftworkers? Not because women aren't interested and capable, says Cynthia Cockburn, but because men as a sex strive to retain the power that comes from controlling technology. Hierarchies and subdivisions at work, and the gendering process, enable men to keep themselves separate from and superior to women in a world of “men's jobs” and “women's jobs”. Here are three first-hand studies of women and men working with new technology in warehousing, clothing manufacture and hospital x-ray - as well as in the engineering firms that develop these new techniques. Cockburn shows that, despite the electronic revolution, men continue to be the technologists and women the lower paid operators. So long as the relations of technology remain masculine, an equal opportunities policy is of little use. An autonomous women's movement inside and outside the trade unions is needed to create women-only training and to transform the nature of technology and the relations of work.

In response to the significant increase of judgment and judgmentalism in contemporary film and television, A Critique of Judgment in Film and Television investigates the evolving connections between the aesthetics and ethics of judgment. The volume ultimately contemplates whether we should, and can, do without judgment, questions that are just the beginning of a much-needed re-examination. The individual contributions of the collection all work towards a very specific focus on judgment that is unprecedented in its transdisciplinary composition and contemporary relevance. By exploring examples of entertainment that aim to instigate judgment, A Critique of Judgment in Film and Television advances the as yet underdeveloped area of research into television and philosophy.
