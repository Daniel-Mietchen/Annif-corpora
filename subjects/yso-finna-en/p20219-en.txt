What log-linear models can social scientists use to examine categorical variables whose attributes may be logically rank-ordered? In this book, the author presents a technique that is often overlooked but highly advantageous when dealing with such ordered variables as social class, political ideology and life satisfaction attitudes.

This title shows how uniting ordinary loglinear analysis and latent class analysis into a general loglinear model with latent variables can result in a modified LISREL approach. This modified LISREL model will enable researchers to analyze categorical data in the same way that they have been able to use LISREL to analyze continuous data.

"Over the past ten years, there have been many important advances in log-linear modeling, including the specification of new models, in particular non-standard models, and their relationships to methods such as Rasch modeling. While most literature on the topic is contained in volumes aimed at advanced statisticians, Applied Log-Linear Modeling presents the topic in an accessible style that is customized for applied researchers who utilize log-linear modeling in the social sciences. The book begins by providing readers with a foundation on the basics of log-linear modeling, introducing decomposing effects in cross-tabulations and goodness-of-fit tests. Popular hierarchical log-linear models are illustrated using empirical data examples, and odds ratio analysis is discussed as an interesting method of analysis of cross-tabulations. Next, readers are introduced to the design matrix approach to log-linear modeling, presenting various forms of coding (effects coding, dummy coding, Helmert contrasts etc.) and the characteristics of design matrices. The book goes on to explore non-hierarchical and nonstandard log-linear models, outlining ten nonstandard log-linear models (including nonstandard nested models, models with quantitative factors, logit models, and log-linear Rasch models) as well as special topics and applications. A brief discussion of sampling schemes is also provided along with a selection of useful methods of chi-square decomposition. Additional topics of coverage include models of marginal homogeneity, rater agreement, methods to test hypotheses about differences in associations across subgroup, the relationship between log-linear modeling to logistic regression, and reduced designs. Throughout the book, Computer Applications chapters feature SYSTAT, Lem, and R illustrations of the previous chapter's material, utilizing empirical data examples to demonstrate the relevance of the topics in modern research"--
Traditional methods of studying burglary have typically utilised thematic analysis, which has yielded insights into how burglars commit their crimes. This study extended those advances by combining a thematic analysis with statistical methods. Furthermore, most research has been carried out on apprehended offenders, while this has provided a rich and fertile source of data. However, given that the majority of burglaries go undetected, there is a genuine possibility that non-apprehended burglars are responsible for at least some of these offences and that they may have a different approach to offending than apprehended offenders. Thus, this study investigates whether there are crime scene behavioural differences between apprehended and non-apprehended burglars.
