Reading the articles in this Handbook about Orthodox theologians on ecumenism, one feels awe at the courage and decisiveness of these great figures who were able to overcome stereotypes and long established perceptions. With God's blessing these Orthodox theologians were able not only to lay foundational stones in the history of Orthodoxy, but also in the history of Ecumenism contributing to theological progress and a better mutual understanding between Churches inside and outside the Orthodox tradition. As a result of their theological work Orthodox theology has become a historic factor and transforming element in the ecumenical movement. This publication will support the ecumenical involvement of Orthodox students, scholars and theologians worldwide, but particularly in the Conference of European Churches, in order also to sustain the continuation of ecumenical collaboration in the work of Christian Advocacy in the European Institutions and beyond.

Orthodox Perspectives on Mission is both a humble tribute to some great Orthodox theologians, who in the past have provided substantial contribution to contemporary missiological and ecumenical discussions, and an Orthodox input to the upcoming 2013 Busan WCC General Assembly. There is a long history of similar contributions by the Orthodox before all the major ecumenical events. The collected volume is divided into two parts: Part I under the subtitle The Orthodox Heritage consists of a limited number of representative Orthodox missiological contributions of the past, whereas Part II includes all the papers presented in the Plenary of the recent Edinburgh 2010 conference, as well as the short studies and contributions prepared during the Edinburgh 2010 ongoing study process.

"This new survey text for comparative religion, authored and edited by Lawrence Sullivan, successfully marries traditional approaches with analysis drawn from anthropology and sociology to explain the making of meaning in leading religious traditions. Sacred space, ritual performance, sacred texts, historical overviews and phenomenological insights are all examined in this full-color text to show the rich diversity of religious belief and practice. Distinctive in this volume are separate chapters on the diversity of Christianity across the globe. Features include numerous photographs of art and artifacts, maps, timelines, tables, textboxes, pedagogy, and a glossary."--Publisher description.

We highly recommend the publication of this new Orthodox Handbook for Teaching Ecumenism edited by a group of orthodox theologians in collaboration with WCC/ETE Program, the Conference of European Churches, Volos Academy for Theological Studies in Greece, and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, Massachusetts. This Handbook which is part of a broader ETE project of pub- lishing resource books for theological education and teaching ecumenism in different settings is in many ways a historic publication. While this Handbook is written by Orthodox authors and is addressed primarily to the Eastern Orthodox, I am sure that it will be useful also for a broader constituency, especially for those who are interested in Orthodox understanding of Church unity and want to learn more about how the Orthodox perceive and relate with the modern ecumenical movement and with other Christian traditions. Congratulating the editorial team, the ETE program and Volos Academy as well as the authors and all those who contributed at this Handbook, I express my confidence that it will be well received among Orthodox Churches and theological schools, that it will contribute significantly to deepen the dialogue within and between the orthodox churches and it will serve properly the purposes for which it was published.

Why do we participate in the ecumenical movement? The answer is simple: because the mission and vision of the Church require it. The Church cannot escape its responsibility and opportunity to "give an answer to everyone, who asks us to give the reason for the hope that we have - and to do this with gentleness and respect." (1 Peter 3.15) As Orthodox Christians, we have no right to ignore the world around us; this world requires our presence and voice wherever it can be heard, precisely because the Church is the guardian of a universal truth, which we have no right to restrict or confine within our zones of comfort. In fact, we are called to proclaim the fullness of this truth precisely where we feel uncomfort- able. For this reason, we wholeheartedly welcome the publication of this Pan-Orthodox Handbook for teaching ecumenism. It is our fervent prayer that this volume will restore and revive the ecumenical vision among our Churches and especially among the younger generation, who are called to sustain and expand it in the years to come.

Traditional organization and content informs this new text which is distinguished by its anthropological and sociological analysis. Sacred space, ritual performance, and sacred texts figure significantly in each religious traditions portrait, along with historical overviews and phenomenological insights and a focus on diverse groups or sects within each tradition. Unlike other texts, Christianity is broken out among its major divisions (early/primitive, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant). Features include a full-color interior, numerous photographs of art and artifacts, maps, timelines, tables, textboxes, pedagogy (outlines, questionsend of chapter and possibly integrated into the text, key terms, reading lists), and a glossary.
