Focusing on the Western philosophical tradition and the work of contemporary feminists, Jean Elshtain explores the general tendency to assert the primacy of the public world--the political sphere dominated by men--and to denigrate the private world--the familial sphere dominated by women. She offers her own positive reconstruction of the public and the private in a feminist theory that reaffirms the importance of the family and envisions an "ethical polity."

With the growth of terrorism, instability in the EU following recession, and the acceleration of support for right-wing political parties in Europe, discussions on the nature of democracy and democratic citizenship have never been more important. Exploring the relationship between democratic values, classroom practices and neo-liberalist ideology in England and in Finland, Educating for Democracy argues that it is the role of governments and the education systems they support to create teachers and students who can voice critically appraised judgements to guide their citizenship. With chapters co-written by English and Finnish authors, this book analyses the history and current state of education systems in England and Finland, with reference to other European countries, in order to establish whether they are effective in creating democratically-minded citizens. Recent years have seen decreasing control of educator professionalism as governments have become more concerned about economic growth, and in some cases, survival. The contributors to this volume question whether educators are becoming less effectual as a result, exploring the idea that democracy is a dying concept, and asking whether educators are now simply creating cogs for the neo-liberalistic/capitalist machine.

This major new study focuses on human rights education in theory and practice. It has three main themes that are inter-related and developed over a range of national and international contexts. The first theme addresses the role of human rights teaching in citizenship education and in education for sustainable development. The second theme focuses on the rights of children in education and the concept of 'voice'. The third theme locates human rights education in curriculum design and classroom practice. This book, which brings together a range of papers originally presented at a conference hosted by the Centre for Human Rights and Citizenship Education in St. Patrick's College in Dublin, makes an important contribution to the current thinking and best practice in human rights education. Contributors include Fionnuala Waldron, Hugh Starkey, James A. Banks, Peter Kirschlaeger, Anita Prunty, Paula Murphy, Susan Pike, Brian Ruane, Colum Kenny and Fintan McCutcheon.
