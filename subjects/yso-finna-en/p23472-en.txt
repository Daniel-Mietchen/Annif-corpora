"A guide for librarians to develop a new relationship with technology that preserves the core mission of libraries while responding to the needs of a new generation of library clients"--Page xxii.
The social media phenomenon is the latest trend today. During the past couple of years, e-mailing and text messaging have given way somewhat to networking on the Internet. Social networking sites, such as MySpace and Facebook, have become particularly popular. Everyone seems to be a part of some Internet community; it seems that nobody wants to be left out.     Lately, the press has reported of a couple of negative incidents where, for example, people have been fired for reasons relating to Facebook use. In worst case scenarios, public status updates have even led to homicides. Networks, which were originally created to maintain relationships, have become surprisingly important in many people's lives. The purpose of this research was to find out what motivates young women to use Facebook and how big of a role it plays in their lives. The research also discusses the world of social media in general. The research group consists of 20- to 35-year-old Finnish women, all registered users of Facebook. To collect the data for this thesis, a quantitative method was used and a structured questionnaire was made, which was sent to the respondents electronically with the Webropol program. The results were tabulated on Microsoft Excel. As a result of the answers submitted to the questionnaire, it can be stated that young women enjoy being on Facebook, mostly to maintain friendships, but also to follow other people's lives. Facebook is not a deadly serious matter, but many have admitted a slight addiction and say that they log in everyday.

Reiluraisio is a social network service that visions the connection of virtual and real world. It aims to make people in control of what they do, call them to act on the problems and take in charge of solutions. It is not a rebellious place but a place where people can share their opinions, ideas and promote them in the form of a group. The system itself should be a usable community development service and should be easily accessible. The idea of "Reiluraisio" was commissioned by Jouni Ylinen, the proprietor of a company "Prohelsingius", located in Raisio, Finland. This thesis describes the process of developing such a service. In today's connected world, to make the service more accessible and easily available web technology was chosen. This thesis describes the creation of a custom web framework for such a service. It also documents the modern web technology used to make websites and different development tools used during the process. Then, it explains the choices of programming languages, database management systems and operating system where the service would be running after the development. The end result of the thesis is a fully functional community development social network service that can be found and used easily for different purposes on the internet.

The objective of this thesis was to develop an online service for travelers who'd like to meet other travelers while on the go. The development process covered the software analysis, design and implementation of the system. TravelersAround is an online service provided to travelers around the world, who would like to spontaneously meet fellow travelers or even the locals, without any need to plan anything in advance. Many times, travelers decide to go on a trip alone, because none of their friends were available at that time or they couldn't find common interest for the same destination. That's where TravelersAround comes in. As a solo traveler, you would benefit the most out of it. Travelers log onto the system and receive a report of fellow travelers around their current location. The report is shown in real-time and provides up-to-date information. The system was developed in a short time and therefore includes the core features and functions, such as: searching for fellow online travelers in the area, sending and receiving messages, profile status updates and managing friends list. These features will provide the building block of the system's further development. Future development will feature mobile phone application for the popular smart phones in the market. The system was developed in C# programming language, .NET Framework 4.0 and SQL Server 2008 and released under the MIT OSI license. In addition, several third party open source libraries were used (refer to the Appendix 2 : Software Design documentation for the full list).

We examined the influence of meme consistency (vs. inconsistency) and intragroup status on the spread of memes in virtual communities. Prior research suggests that information consistent with the theme of the group is remembered better and that ideas threatening to the group identity are rejected. In addition, previous research shows that low-status group members mimic high-status members and communicate with them to seek information and approval. We analyzed social interactions among members of four online forums from January 1, 2010, to February 21, 2014. Contrary to our prediction, our results show that memes initiated by low-status members spread faster than memes started by high- or moderate-status members. In line with prior research, memes that were consistent with a forum theme were spread more frequently than inconsistent memes..

The thesis investigates the opportunitites that business-to-business companies have in the social media market and to facilitate an understanding of the LinkedIn environment. The objective is to create a manual supporting Nets, a company in the IT industry, to enter the social media environment through LinkedIn. The thesis consists of six parts; introduction, history of social networking sites, social media marketing, case company analysis, benchmarking and strategic planning. The benchmarking process is done through desk research, by collecting information about competitors' and non-competitors' company pages on LinkedIn. The research started in June 2013 and was completed in October 2013. The findings reveal best-in-class-examples such as videos supporting employer branding, nicheing content to reach the target groups and failures such as use of non-relevant videos, sales pitches glorifying the company and low quality graphics. The results of the benchmarking and strategic analysis are used as the basis for the LinkedIn handbook, to support the internal social media processes and create a common understanding of how to use LinkedIn for the case company.

Abstract: Post-purchase evaluation in the smartphone market : an investigation into cognitive dissonance among iPhone and other smartphone brand owners. Purpose    The main objective was to investigate whether iPhone owners experienced less cognitive post-purchase dissonance than other brand owners and was this due to the marketing communications efforts of Apple Inc., from hereon called Apple. Finally, the influence of Web 2.0 in the process of post-purchase evaluation was examined. Web 2.0 is a version of the Internet and it encourages towards user engagement on websites such as Facebook.    Methodology    A critical review of the literature on cognitive dissonance was carried out and an online questionnaire was sent out to three hundred and five people. Sixty-eight responses were received. Of the respondents, forty-nine had a smartphone, of which twelve had an iPhone and thirty seven had other brand phone. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied, but the emphasis was on quantitative.    Findings    In many instances iPhone owners were more satisfied with their choice than the other brand owners. However, there were no particular indicators of the other brand owners being distinctively more dissonant than iPhone owners. There was no particular difference in the recall rate of traditional marketing communications efforts of Apple between iPhone and the other brand owners, but iPhone owners were significantly more present in Web 2.0 and recalled encountering iPhone more.    Research Limitations/Implications    The survey was carried out in the smartphone market with a small sample so caution needs to be taken when generalising the results. It would be interesting to study all brands as separate groups and compare the level of dissonance between them.    Practical Implications    The main conclusion was that more effort should be put on marketing communications in Web 2.0 when aiming to decrease dissonance.    Originality/Value    As there is little published literature or research on the Web 2.0 and cognitive dissonance in the smartphone market, this study provides valuable insight on smartphone owners' post-purchase evaluation and behaviour online.
