Paradoxes of postcolonial culture : contemporary women writers of the Indian and Afro-Italian diaspora
Literary production is increasingly shaped by globalization and the complex nature of cultural, political, and social interaction. As such, longstanding colonial and postcolonial relations between Africa and Europe have yielded a range of challenging questions, and new generations of writers with roots in Africa have invariably found themselves navigating new geographic terrains and negotiating racialized identities, while simultaneously exploring the potential of literature in addressing these historical transitions. Linguistic challenges often accompany writing in global diasporic settings and are usually closely tied to colonial influence. More recently, however, authors residing in geographic spaces outside of colonially-defined migratory spaces have also been confronted with alternative challenges as they endeavour to translate experience. Building on, and in dialogue with, existing scholarship in related fields, and alongside discussions of Caribbean, French, and North African literature, individual chapters in Afroeuropean Cartographies offer a multi-sited, transnational, and interdisciplinary framework with which to consider the increasing pertinence of critical categories such as Afroeuropeanism or Afropeanism, and how these might assist in circumscribing the diverse influences shaping literary production. Afroeuropean authors consider the demands and exigencies associated with life in Europe, while also revealing the multiple ways in which identities are necessarily being redefined. In addition, they emphasize the historical dimension of these relationships, suggest how co-existence could be achieved, and delineate the coordinates of a larger project of communal existence and twenty-first century community-building. Afroeuropean Cartographies points to the vibrancy, ingenuity, creativity, and capacity of writers to imagine the contours of a diverse and inclusive Europe, underscoring the ways in which the concerns and objectives of Afroeuropeans are inseparable from Europeans' own reckoning with colonial history and its legacy, and, of course, from the broader project of Europeanization.

Study of the African diaspora is now a dynamic field in the development of new methods and approaches to African history. Unlike the transAtlantic diaspora, eastwards African migrants have received little attention. Studies on communities of African origin in Asia have increased, and some have restored the gallantry and glory that once belonged to some African migrants in Asia. This book brings together the latest research on African diaspora in Asia with case studies about India and the Indian Ocean islands.

Traditions from Africa
Many African migrants residing abroad nurture a hope to one day return, at least temporarily, to their home country. In the wake of economic crises in the developed world, alongside rapid economic growth in parts of Africa, the impetus to 'return' is likely to increase. Such returnees are often portrayed as agents of development, bringing with them capital, knowledge and skills as well as connections and experience gained abroad. Yet, the reality is altogether more complex. In this much-needed volume, based on extensive original fieldwork, the authors reveal that there is all too often a gaping divide between abstract policy assumptions and migrants' actual practices. In contrast to the prevailing optimism of policies on migration and development, Africa's Return Migrants demonstrates that the capital obtained abroad is not always advantageous and that it can even hamper successful entrepreneurship and other forms of economic, political and social engagement.

Slavery and Muslim society in Africa : the institution in Saharan and Sudanic Africa and the Trans-Saharan trade
The Nordic countries are now firmly ensconced in academia as gender-friendly welfare states. They are seen as pioneering countries with respect to changes in family life and gender relations and thus present an interesting forum for family research. This paper explores how gender caring relates to gender, religion and parenting in Sub-Saharan African families in the context of immigration to Finland. A constructionist perspective is employed to illuminate how guidelines or scripts established in these parents' cultures are actively used and how they in turn influence their gender relations. Gender caring is conceptualized as an ethic of reciprocity, solidarity and obligation to ensure interdependence and strong bonds among black African parents. The article draws on in-depth interviews conducted with twelve couples mainly in the Helsinki area (which includes Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen).
Witches, Goddesses and Angry Spirits: The Politics of Spiritual Liberation in African Diaspora Women's Fiction explores African diaspora religious practices as vehicles for Africana women's spiritual transformation, using representative fictions by three contemporary writers of the African Americas who compose fresh models of female spirituality: Breath, Eyes, Memory (1994) by Haitian American novelist Edwidge Danticat; Paradise (1998) by African American Nobel laureate Toni Morrison; and I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem (1992) by Guadeloupean author Maryse CondeÃÅ. Author Maha Marouan argues that while these authors' works burst with powerful female figures--witches, goddesses, healers, priestesses, angry spirits--they also remain honest in reminding readers of the silences surrounding African diaspora women's realities and experiences of violence, often as a result of gendered religious discourses. To make sense of Africana women's experiences of the diaspora, this book operates from a transnational perspective that moves across national and linguistic boundaries as it connects the Anglophone, the Francophone, and the Creole worlds of the African Americas. In doing so, Marouan identifies crucial shared thematic concerns regarding the authors' engagement with religious frameworks--some Judeo-Christian, some not--heretofore unexamined in such a careful, comparative fashion.
"The integration of new immigrants is one of the most important issues in Europe, yet not enough is known about the lives of migrants. This book draws on several years of ethnographic research with African migrants in Ireland, many of whom are former asylum seekers. Against the widespread assumptions that integration has been handled well in Ireland and that racism is not a major problem, this book shows that migrants are themselves shaping integration in their everyday lives in the face of enormous challenges. The book will appeal to scholars and students interested in migration and ethnicity and to a general reading public interested in the stories of integration in Ireland. The book is situated within current anthropological theory and makes an important contribution, both theoretically and empirically, to understandings of the everyday and a site of possibility and critique."--Publisher's website.

"The latest work from pioneering scholar George Elliott Clarke, Directions Home is the most comprehensive analysis of African-Canadian texts and writers to date. Building on the discoveries of his critically acclaimed Odysseys Home, Clarke passionately analyses the beautiful complexities and haunting conundrums of this important body of literature. Directions Home explores the trajectories and tendencies of African-Canadian literature within the Canadian canon and the socio-cultural traditions of the African Diaspora. Clarke showcases the importance of little-known texts, including church histories and slave narratives, and offers studies of autobiography, crime and punishment, jazz poetics, and musical composition. The collection also includes studies of significant contemporary writers such as George Boyd and Dionne Brand, and trailblazing African-Canadian intellectuals like A.B. Walker and Anna Minerva Henderson. With its national, bilingual, and historical perspectives, Directions Home is an essential guide to African-Canadian literature." --Publisher's description.

"The Things That Fly in the Night explores images of vampirism in Caribbean and African diasporic folk traditions and in contemporary fiction. Giselle Liza Anatol focuses on the figure of the soucouyant, or Old Hag--an aged woman by day who sheds her skin during night's darkest hours in order to fly about her community and suck the blood of her unwitting victims. In contrast to the glitz, glamour, and seductiveness of conventional depictions of the European vampire, the soucouyant triggers unease about old age and female power. Tracing relevant folklore through the English- and French-speaking Caribbean, the U.S. Deep South, and parts of West Africa, Anatol shows how tales of the nocturnal female bloodsuckers not only entertain and encourage obedience in pre-adolescent listeners, but also work to instill particular values about women's "proper" place and behaviors in society at large. Alongside traditional legends, Anatol considers the explosion of soucouyant and other vampire narratives among writers of Caribbean and African heritage who in the past twenty years have rejected the demonic image of the character and used her instead to urge for female mobility, racial and cultural empowerment, and anti colonial resistance. Texts include work by authors as diverse as Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, U.S. National Book Award winner Edwidge Danticat, and science fiction/fantasy writers Octavia Butler and Nalo Hopkinson"--
African Migrants and Europe: managing the ultimate frontier engages the transformation of extraterritorial migration control in the post 9/11 era. It illustrates how border controls have become more diffuse and less clearly localizable in the face of increased human flows and exceptional policies and institutions that justify an array of violent practices. The book presents a critical analysis of the dispositif of the externalization of migration control: detention without trial, derogation of human rights law, torture, "extraordinary rendition" and the curtailment of civil liberties and the securitization of migration. After exploring the role of Gaddafi‚Äôs Libya in the last ten years as a gendarme of Europe, the book expands the concept of externalization of migration control beyond geospatial accounts, and looks at the political transformation of migration control within and away from the gateways of Europe. Moving through spaces of in/security, and times of panic, this work argues for a re-visioning of borders and frontiers in ways that can account for their dialectical nature, and for the dialectical nature of political life.
