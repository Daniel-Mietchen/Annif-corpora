This volume provides comprehensive and authoritative coverage of all the main areas linked to geomagnetic field observation, from instrumentation to methodology, on ground or near-Earth. Efforts are also focused on a 21st century e-Science approach to open access to all geomagnetic data, but also to the data preservation, data discovery, data rescue, and capacity building. Finally, modeling magnetic fields with different internal origins, with their variation in space and time, is an attempt to draw together into one place the traditional work in producing models as IGRF or describing the magn.

In the eighties, a group of theoretical physicists introduced several models for certain disordered systems, called 'spin glasses'. These models are simple and rather canonical random structures, of considerable interest for several branches of science (statistical physics, neural networks and computer science). The physicists studied them by non-rigorous methods and predicted spectacular behaviors. The first volume of this new and completely rewritten edition presents six fundamental models and the basic techniques to study them.

"Magnetic Materials is an introduction to the basics of magnetism, magnetic materials, and their applications in modern device technologies. Retaining the concise style of the original, this edition has been thoroughly revised to address significant developments in the field, including the improved understanding of basic magnetic phenomena, new classes of materials, and changes to device paradigms. With homework problems, solutions to selected problems, and a detailed list of references, Magnetic Materials continues to be the ideal book for a one-semester course and as a self-study guide for researchers new to the field. This edition consists of new chapters on exchange-bias coupling, multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials, and magnetic insulators; substantial updates to the chapters on magnetic recording and magnetic semiconductors, incorporating the latest advances in the fields; and new example problems with worked solutions"--

This is a new, completely revised, updated and enlarged edition of the author's Ergebnisse vol. 46: "Spin Glasses: A Challenge for Mathematicians" in two volumes (this is the 2nd volume). In the eighties, a group of theoretical physicists introduced several models for certain disordered systems, called "spin glasses". These models are simple and rather canonical random structures, of considerable interest for several branches of science (statistical physics, neural networks and computer science). The physicists studied them by non-rigorous methods and predicted spectacular behaviors. This book introduces in a rigorous manner this exciting new area to the mathematically minded reader. It requires no knowledge whatsoever of any physics. The present Volume II contains a considerable amount of new material, in particular all the fundamental low-temperature results obtained after the publication of the first edition
