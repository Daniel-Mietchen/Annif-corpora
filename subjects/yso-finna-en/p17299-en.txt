blasphemy

In doing so, it analyzes their discourses on religion and the sacred.

Blasphemy
This volume deals with the cultural and legal debates which have counterposed the right to free speech and the need to protect Christian sensibilities in Britain from the time of the French Revolution to the present day. Central to the book is a close study of the content and public reception of the anti-Christian literature of the 19th century associated with the names G.W. Foote and J.W. Gott, the "Freethinker" and the "Truthseeker". David Nash here also examines a variety of critical-theoretical approaches to blasphemy and blasphemous writing, including postmodernism and the work of Foucault and Said. The book concludes with a detailed examination of 20th-century blasphemy cases, up to and including the "Gay News" case, "The Last Temptation of Christ" and "Visions of Ecstasy".
