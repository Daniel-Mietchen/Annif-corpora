"Since Intelligent M&A was released in June 2007, the short and final chapter on How to survive a merger has received a lot of attention and the information provided therein appears to be robust enough to withstand that attention. Therefore, the proposed book will build on the organisation of that chapter and would be divided roughly into the following chapters: - Background on mergers and acquisitions: why companies merge and what happens to employees in those mergers - The first decision facing employees: stay or leave? - Attitude and personal performance - Timing issues: when to act? - Preparation during the pre-merger phase - Should you rely on your boss (and to what degree to 'trust' the company)? - The need to stay around the office - Taking care of your own team - Networking  internally and externally - Maintaining clients - The importance of flexibility in accepting new assignments - Preparing for the worst. Written in an engaging style, with real global case studies, this is an extremely valuable guide for any manager or employee concerned about their jobs when their companies are undergoing a corporate restructuring. (NB. The book is intended to be of use to readers globally. It therefore does not have a chapter on legal issues in being made redundant, as this information is out-dated quickly, isn't the expertise of the author and is available from experts elsewhere)"--Provided by publisher.

The end of labour history?
""We spend more time working than doing anything else in life. It's not right that the experience of work should be so demotivating and dehumanizing." So says Laszlo Bock, head of People Operations at the company that transformed how the world interacts with knowledge. This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto with the potential to change how we work and live. Drawing on the latest research in behavioral economics and with a profound grasp of human psychology, Bock also provides teaching examples from a range of industries -- including companies that are household names but hideous places to work, and little-known companies that achieve spectacular results by valuing and listening to their employees. Bock takes us inside one of history's most explosively successful businesses to reveal why Google is consistently rated one of the best places to work in the world, distilling 15 years of intensive worker R&D into delightfully counterintuitive principles that are easy to put into action, whether you're a team of one or a team of thousands. Cleaving the knot of conventional management, some lessons from WORK RULES! include: Take away managers' power over employees Learn from your best employees - and your worst Only hire people who are smarter than you are, no matter how long it takes to find them Pay unfairly (it's fairer!) Don't trust your gut: use data to predict and shape the future Default to open: be transparent, and welcome feedback If you're comfortable with the amount of freedom you've given your employees, you haven't gone far enough WORK RULES! shows how to strike a balance between creativity and structure, leading to success you can measure in quality of life as well as market share. Read it to build a better company from within rather than from above; read it to reawaken your joy in what you do. "--

This research is conducted for Dressmann Oy, an internationally operating Norwegian men's clothing store. The research problem is to identify Dressmann's internal brand image among sales staff. The study consists of evaluating Dressmann' s internal brand communication channels and methods, studying employee brand awareness and emotional commitment to the brand. First research objective is to identify how efficiently the brand is communicated to the employees and what are the possible brand information bottlenecks. Secondly, to evaluate if the employees are living the brand. The thesis concentrates in measuring in which level the current brand awareness and emotional commitment are among sales staff. The theory was based on brand communications, internal branding process, and in recognizing the potential benefits of strong internal brands. The theoretical framework summarizes the main theory concepts, which are brought together and adapted into a creation of a new internal brand evaluation tool, also known as internal brand state. The internal brand state recognizes and helps to evaluate the brand from both awareness and emotional commitment sides, and illustrates the efficiency of brand communications. The survey was conducted by quantitative method and 33 respondents of the possible 52 answered the questionnaire. The survey included 53 multiple-choice questions and five open-ended questions. The survey was carried out among the employees of Greater Helsinki region in the beginning of February 2010. The results imply that currently the brand communications are working fairly well, but some weak links in the brand communications were found and indentified. Internal brand state is currently on a good level, but especially the brand visioning part needs to be improved from both awareness and emotional commitment sides. It is important to notice that emotional commitment, among sales staff, was slightly higher than the awareness in all of the evaluated branding process parts. Recommendations include using the internal brand state for managerial purposes and recog-nize the efficiency levels of individual internal communication channels. The need for emphasizing the role of store managers and co-workers in communicating the brand in order to enhance the internal brand development.
