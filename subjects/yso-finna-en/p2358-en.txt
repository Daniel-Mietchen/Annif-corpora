"The book describes practical procedures for the destruction of hazardous chemicals and biological agents in the laboratory in which they are used. The book is a continuation and expansion of "Destruction of Hazardous Chemicals in the Laboratory." It follows the same general approach as the first and second editions but includes a number of new chapters including one on using advanced oxidation techniques as a general means of degrading chemicals. All the monographs from the second edition are incorporated in this volume and are revised and extended as necessary. A number of new monographs describing procedures for the destruction of hazardous chemicals have also been added.The destruction of many pharmaceuticals is also described in this book. This subject has become of increasing importance with recent reports of the detection of pharmaceuticals in the water supply. Finally a new addition is the chapter "General Methods for the Destruction of Hazardous Chemicals in the Laboratory." This chapter describes recent advanced oxidation methods that should be generally applicable to all organic compounds. The methods use commonly available laboratory equipment and reagents"--

Designed to accompany the new Open University course in Environmental Monitoring and Protection, this is one of four new titles which will equip the reader with the tools to undertake Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). Used in planning, decision-making and management, EIAs review both the theoretical principles and environmental considerations of engineering and environmental projects to help steer fundamental legislation in the right direction. This book begins with a discussion of the basics of the hydrological cycle and a description of the natural aquatic environment including the no.

The aim of this thesis was to improve methods for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and terphenyl (PCT) analytics with the equipment that was available, examine leaching of PCBs and PCTs from sample material and also determine the amount of mentioned compounds in the sample material. PCBs and PCTs have been widely used in products such as cooling liquids, flame retardant and additives in paints, printing inks and surfactants before environmental problems they cause were discovered.     For PCB- and PCT-analytics there was available gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and a compatible non-polar column. Based on the literature, a mid-polar column would have been the best option, but it was not available. In analytics of PCBs and PCTs, the thing that makes analysis challenging is the similarity of different compounds, so called congeners. Their retention times and mass spectra are very close to each other. In addition, in samples there is usually either very high or very low concentration of PCBs and PCTs and that further complicates analytics. In this thesis, sample material was ground waste from a storage room of an elementary school located in Tampere. The total amount of PCBs and PCTs in this material and leaching of them into water was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.     Contrary to preliminary information, no PCT-compounds were found from the sample material, so in this study attention was paid to analytics of Aroclor 1260 PCB mixture, for it was found from the sample material. The temperature program of gas chromatograph and ions to be monitored with mass spectrometer were chosen to be optimal for that exact PCB mixture. From the sample material was found about 3 700 mg of PCB compounds per kilogram of ground waste. This amount exceeds the limit of hazardous waste and thus has to be treated as hazardous waste. However, leaching of PCBs into the water was minimal, as highest 0.01 % of the PCB amount the waste contained.    All in all, compared to old methods used, there was change in temperature program, ions to be monitored and way of preparing standard solutions. In the future PCB and PCT analytics could be further promoted by creating respective methods also for other PCB and PCT mixtures. In this way analytics of other PCB and PCT mixtures can also be done in a highly reliable manner.        Keywords: Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated terphenyls, GC-MS.
