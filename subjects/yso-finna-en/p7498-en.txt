This bachelor's thesis was commissioned by Sonera, which is one of Finland's leading telecommunications companies. The purpose of this study was to find out whether the sales model of Sonera Store is consistently implemented in practice in the desired way and to offer proposals for improving the existing sales model. Furthermore, the motivational incentives of the sales agents and the role of the sales management as a motivating factor were examined.    The data for this case study research were collected by observing the sales agents in customer service and sales encounters as well as with the help of semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Combining two different qualitative data collection methods offered a deeper understanding of the researchable topics and enabled the comparison between what was said in the interviews and what was put into action in reality. The interview was carried out with ten different sales agents from three different Sonera Stores. In the observations, five sales agents were studied in thirteen different customer encounters.    The study revealed that not all steps of the sales model are implemented in the way the sales agents are instructed. The omission of certain procedures was explained mainly with the lack of motivation caused by the disbelief that implementing them would offer any additional value to the sales agents or customers, or would have any positive impact on the sales. The study pointed out that the mindset of the sales agents is desirably sales-oriented and that the hindering sticking points are mostly explained by technical and other matters over which the sales agents have no control. In addition, it was found out that motivational factors are experienced very differently. In general, however, the study showed that the most improvement possibilities are in the current bonus model and sales training.    The findings of this study indicate that the sales model is not fully implemented in the intended way and that there is room for improvement in the incentive system and sales training. Implementing these and other improvement suggestions presented in the thesis is believed to have an enhancing effect on the motivation and overall performance of the sales agents. Notably more research should be carried out in other Sonera Stores of Finland in order to gain a more reliable understanding of the topic. Furthermore, the viewpoint of the customers and the sales management is left out, which calls for further research in the future.    Key words: sales, sales model, personal selling, sales management, customer service, employee motivation, case study.

Improving verification and validation activities in ICT companies : product development management approach
In this compelling memoir, Nokia's legendary CEO Jorma Ollila presents a riveting account of the inner workings of the company that created the global mobile revolution. CEO from 1992 to 2006, Ollila led Nokia from near catastrophe to become the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer. He built a company where visionary thinking and courageous decisions were combined with exceptional creativity and first-rate engineering, leading to phenomenal growth. Readers will follow Ollila's personal and professional journey, where they'll learn about the fine line between stratospheric success and disastrous failure. His stories are filled with lessons about the nature of leadership, the importance of shared values, and the need for strategic thinking.Ollila offers a uniquely clear picture of life as a CEO, with many insights into how business is conducted at the highest levels. He is especially upfront about working with his executive and management teams as well as encounters with figures such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and George Soros. He offers poignant as well as illuminating stories of hair-raising risks and huge successes, but also of poor judgment and bad decision-making. Against All Odds, translated into English for the first time, includes a new Epilogue to bring the reader up-to-date on Ollila's thoughts about more recent events regarding the company, up to and including their decision to sell their mobile phone business to Microsoft.

Executive summary (s. 10-12).
"Without venture capital, many of the companies whose technical innovations sparked the digital revolution would not exist. Venture investments funded these firms to develop their bright ideas into commercial products that created new business models and established whole new markets. In Profiting from Innovation, Henry Kressel, a partner at multi-billion-dollar global investing company Warburg Pincus, takes you behind the scenes of the private equity process. He draws on his extensive experience to show how venture capital works, why venture capitalists fund certain companies and not others, and what factors influence the success or failure of their high-risk, high-reward investments. He also discusses venture capital's future, now that the commercialization of technology requires larger investments and global market access. Written in clear, non-technical language, the book features informative case studies of venture capital funding in a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, software and services, semiconductors, and the internet"--
"This book investigates the creation and implementation of enterprise information systems, covering a wide array of topics such as flow-shop scheduling, information systems outsourcing, ERP systems utilization, Dietz transaction methodology, and advanced planning systems"--Provided by publisher.
The main task for most development-intensive organisations is to create, develop and commercialise new products and services. The technology push (TP) concept is considered an important competitive advantage for companies trying to create breakthrough products. Because development processes are risky and failure rates are high, especially in the case of technology pushed projects, defined success factors are valuable knowledge for the management of development-intensive firms.The prime objective of this study is to present a compact set of TP project success factors in an information and communication technology (ICT) context. Because the literature on new product development and innovation has presented many success factors for developed products, but has done so in a way that presents the factors as having a nebulous nature, the specification of TP success factors is also presented. The success factors are also empirically validated. The goal of the validation was to determine the relevance of the success factors introduced, and potentially define new ones. The validation was performed through an empirical study with semi-structured company interviews.As a result of this study we concluded that one success factor defined through the literature review should be removed due to a lack of relevance, that the other twelve success factors were validated, and three new success factors were identified during the empirical study. Eventually fifteen TP success factors are defined and presented.The practical relevance of this study is to help firm management to recognise the real actions needed to reduce product development risks. The theoretical relevance is in helping scholars to focus on key issues when studying the key factors of breakthrough development cases.

The thesis aims to reveal the strategic objectives of Finnish ICT company X in the cross-border acquisition of Y - a Russian ICT services provider. This study attempts to conclude a comprehensive pre-acquisition research and thereby contribute to the accomplishment of acquisition objectives. Why should company X acquire company Y? The author approaches this question from the acquirer's perspective and identifies X's major motives for entering in the M&A transaction. In the theoretical research the author reviews the existing literature on the topic and identifies the major taxonomies of acquisition drivers. The theoretical perspectives adopted by scholars to explain the phenomenon of corporate M&A are also examined and highlighted. Next, building on previously discussed theories, the author proposes his own model of feasibility conditions under which the various drivers for M&A transactions would operate. Finally, the model is employed for the case acquisition analysis. The empirical research is based upon the qualitative research method. In the course of interviews with X's management the author tests the proposed model of M&A motives in relation to the case transaction. This is followed by the discussion of the opportunities which make the acquisition of Y feasible, the emerging constraints, and the academic theories which best explain the case in point. The most important strategic objectives of X cross-border acquisition on the Russian market include a number of synergetic gains such as diversification, vertical integration benefits and operational synergies. Evidence has been found to support the connections between the case acquisition's motives and the efficiency theory of mergers.

The thesis focuses on new product development (NPD) of ICT services. NPD is a well researched field. However, its background in production of manufactured goods leaves a gap in terms of how the theories fit to the NPD of services. The thesis investigates the use of NPD in the context of ICT services. The thesis provides the design rationale for the development work done in TietoEnator Processing and Network Oy, which further developed the Concorde NPD model stage-gate approach and Develop-stage of the model. The model was described as a process, which enabled clarifying inputs, outputs, activities, tools and roles. The thesis uses theories and methods from NPD management, service management, process management and knowledge management to build a theoretical framework for NPD of ICT services. These are categorized to conceptual, utilitarian and strategic core theories and applied to support the Concorde NPD model and a related maturity model. While the diverse theoretical background creates a vast landscape of options, current state analysis is used to find the main focus areas. The maturity model is build to describe relationships of model development areas as well as to the larger issue of product lifecycle management (PLM). The thesis work is based on constructive research. The main interest was solving a managerial problem (i.e. how to further develop Concorde NPD model manageability) through development of a construct (the NPD process model and supporting material) by using empirical analysis (through active observation through participation to NPD projects, interviews and existing documentation review) and theoretical analysis (through NPD and related theory review). The construct was validated based on review rounds of material and interviews. The thesis uses academic and trade books as well as articles as background for the theoretical part of the constructive research. Empirical part was based on available documentation of the Concorde model, a set of interviews of NPD workers and people working on related area in other TietoEnator business areas (i.e. strategic business units) beyond TietoEnator Oy and active observation based on participation to NPD projects. The main output of the development work was a  revised NPD approach, which was process driven and contained linkages to the larger frame of PLM and to the maturity model. The maturity model indicates that while initial improvement efforts in NPD alone are possible, in the long term NPD improvement is limited unless PLM is driven as a process. The current Concorde-model processes supports only a subset of PLM. While many of the areas of NPD can be improved, with the current situation in TE PN Oy, with the transfer of work to low-cost countries and customer-oriented strategy, there seems to be a lack a direct imperative for NPD approach development. Therefore, the prioritization between different business development efforts and clear communication of these priorities needs to be strengthened if more rapid NPD improvement is to be achieved.
