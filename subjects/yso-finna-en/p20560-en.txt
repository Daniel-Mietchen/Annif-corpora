condition assesment
The safety, maintenance and repair of bridges and buildings depend on effective inspection and monitoring techniques. These methods need to be able to identify problems often hidden within structures before they become serious. This important collection reviews key techniques and their applications to bridges, buildings and other civil structures. The first group of chapters reviews ways of testing corrosion in concrete components. Given their continuing importance and vulnerability to decay, the next series of chapters describes ways of testing wood components within civil structures. A final group of chapters looks at visual and acoustic techniques and their use to assess bridges in particular. Inspection and monitoring techniques for bridges and civil structures is an invaluable reference for civil engineers involved in safety inspection, maintenance and repair of bridges and civil structures.
