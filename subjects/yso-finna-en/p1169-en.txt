In order to assess the dietary intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by Kuwaiti population, concentrations of PAHs were determined in edible tissues of commercially important seafood (fish and shrimp) samples collected from fish markets in 2005. Naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthrene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were routinely detected in all samples analyzed. The concentrations of Sigma PAHs ranged between 30 and 247 ng/g dry wt. with yellowfin seabream imported from Iran exhibiting the highest concentration followed by Nile tilapia imported from Egypt (218 ng/g dry wt.) and then by locally caught silver pomfret (142 ng/g dry wt.) and Jinga shrimp (139 ng/g dry wt.). The PAHs pattern was dominated by the presence of high molecular weight compounds with pyrene as the most prevalent compound (59.1% of the total). The mean exposure for the average adult Kuwaiti consumer to Sigma PAHs and benzo(a)pyrene equivalents (BaPEs) was estimated to be 1.3 micro g/day and 0.0013 micro g/day, respectively. The concentration and composition of PAHs found in this study are similar to those reported for fish from the Arabian Gulf basin in other studies over the past two decades, suggesting that the sources of pollution might have remained relatively unchanged. Nevertheless, the levels of exposure to PAHs through seafood consumption in the Northern Arabian Gulf environment, particularly in Kuwait, do not represent an unacceptable health risk due to the fact that these exposure levels were below the reference dose established by the European Union law.

In this thesis, the magnetic resonance and magneto-optical rotation parameters are studied in single-layer carbon systems of two different dimensionalities. Based on electronic structure calculations, the spectral parameters are predicted for both extended (2D) and finite, molecular (0D) systems consisting of pure sp²-hybridised pristine graphene (G), as well as hydrogenated and fluorinated, sp³-hybridised graphene derivatives, graphane (HG) and fluorographene (FG), respectively.Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters are calculated for G, HG and FG systems at their large-system limit. For their 0D counterparts, graphene flakes, qualitative spectral trends are predicted as functions of their size and perimeter type. The last group of studied carbon systems consists of 2D graphenes containing spin-1/2 paramagnetic defects. Electron spin resonance (ESR) parameters and paramagnetic NMR shieldings are predicted for four different paramagnetic systems, including the vacancy-defected graphane and fluorographene, as well as graphene with hydrogen and fluorine adatoms. The magneto-optic properties of G and HG flakes are studied in terms of Faraday optical rotation and nuclear spin optical rotation parameters, to investigate the effects of their finite size and also the different level of hydrogenation.All the different investigated parameters displayed characteristic sensitivity to the electronic and atomic structure of the studied graphenes. The parameters obtained provide an insight into the physics of these 0D and 2D carbon materials, and encourage experimental verification.
