The subject of this Bachelor's thesis is Almaco Group Oy's material logistics in a ship refurbishment project. The objective was to study the current logistics chain and to find out the bottlenecks of material packing and material packing markings as well as to find solutions to the problems that were detected. The need for the research was noticed when the refurbishment project in Singapore was underway. The material packing lists were incomplete and the packing of materials delicate to moisture and hits was insufficient. The focus of this thesis is on the development of packing lists, labels, and improvement of packing materials. The research is based on the writer's own experience as a project assistant in the project in Singapore and interviewing the people who are responsible for the logistics of the company. Solutions for problems arisen were searched by studying the essential information. The theory chapter of the thesis includes information about logistics and the importance of successful logistics to companies in general. Theory, interviews and the writer's own conclusions were used to create improvement suggestions to the packing lists, as well as to sufficient packing. The main emphasis in the thesis was on financial savings, because improvements should always create savings for the company. A model for the packing lists making the project work faster and simpler was created in the thesis. In material packing the emphasis was on clarifying the ways different materials are packed. Furthermore, methods for the delivery of large amounts as well as the packing of materials delicate to moisture and hits were presented. The company needs to engage in carrying out the changes presented in the thesis in order to see whether they will bring results and financial benefits. This will require carrying the changes out in a few projects.

The action based investigative thesis “The Significance of Visual Elements in Music Publishing” serves as a personal reflective analysis of a design student and an artist. The thesis is based on complete packaging designs for two CD-albums that the author has planned, designed and arranged for printing. The thesis will also try to describe and venture into the visual sides of promotion for the latest albums and how they were blueprinted and executed. The main objective for the thesis is to illustrate the complete processes of creating complex artwork for album packaging in a versatile manner. By reflecting on the methods used in design management and companies’ image control, the thesis also aims to investigate the significance and functions of visual elements in music publishing as a whole. This especially considers the genre of rock music, which the albums described in this thesis are categorized into. In conclusion, the whole thesis works as a platform for personal growth as an artist and a student in the visual field of study, while also working as an example to designers working with similar projects. The thesis also provides helpful information on how to achieve a fitting, attractive and promotionally intriguing visual identity in today’s music business to the interested about the ongoing pursuit of success in the music field.

This thesis aims at finding out what the important and meaningful communicational factors are in sales packages when a consumer is making buying decisions? The study concentrates in the stereo headsets sales packages. A sales package has been recognized to be a powerful way to communicate and contact the customer and it has become a significant tool for marketing communication. Growing amount of self-service based sales points has increased the sales package`s communicational value. The theory part contains an overview of packaging development discussing the phases in a typical sales package project as well as the description of objectives and decisions in different phases. Also the communicational elements of a sales package, such as package style, colors, images and package and brand are dealt with in general terms. The research part contains detailed evaluation of four different brands stereo headphones sales packages and findings from consumer interviews. Based on observations from interviews and evaluations of existing sales packages ideas how to develop and improve the sales package communication of stereo headphones are suggested to Nokia Accessories.

This thesis work is based on the process of making new product packing instructions for Pyrollpack Oy, a Finnish paper bag and wrappings manufacturer.  The aim of this work was to gather the existing but scattered packing information and use it to create separate product group and machine group based instructions that would provide a clear guide of product packing for the whole factory.  The theoretical part of this thesis work contains information about properties and manufacturing of paper bags and wrappings as well as logistics in the packing process. This thesis work contains a confidential part.

The importance of price and package design for consumers when they buy premium private label products
As a part of customer service at Distribution Center Europe of Metso Minerals' spare- and ware parts unit, freight prices frequently need to be estimated before goods are physically packed. This requires estimating how the individual combinations of items will be finally packed in order to be able to use the gross-weight and volumetric-weight driven price lists supplied by external freight forwarders. This research tries to establish a standard approach how to handle such preliminary freight estimates by analyzing whether it is possibly to develop freight pricing systems based on the limited information available (practically net weights, net volumes, and number of items) before the shipment is picked and packed at the warehouse. The main research approach is statistical; the aim is to derive gross weights, and, if possible, gross volumes and the number of handling units using a linear regression analysis. Other statistical and non-statistical methods have been unified in a second approach in order to both support the results gained in the regression analysis, and also minimize the possible deficiencies of the latter. The results of this research have been incorporated into practical, mostly Microsoft-Excel-based tools that have been made available to the logistics team at Distribution Center Europe in order to facilitate the often time consuming process of freight price estimations and freight invoicing.
