Summarizing current knowledge of grouse biology, this volume is organized in four sections--spatial ecology, habitat relationships, population biology, and conservation and management--and offers insights into spatial requirements, movements, and demography of grouse. Much of the research employs emerging tools in ecology that span biogeochemistry, molecular genetics, endocrinology, radio-telemetry, and remote sensing.--Adapted from publisher description on back cover.

"A comprehensive review of dryland climates and their relationship to the physical environment, hydrology, and inhabitants. Chapters are divided into four major sections on background meteorology and climatology; the nature of dryland climates in relation to precipitation and hydrology; the climatology and climate dynamics of the major dryland regions on each continent; and an extensive review of long-term climate variability in the world's drylands. It includes key topics such as vegetation, geomorphology, desertification, micro-habitats, and adaptation to dryland environments. This interdisciplinary volume provides an extensive review of the primary literature (covering over 2500 references) and the conventional and satellite datasets that form key research tools for dryland climatology. Illustrated with over 100 photographs, it presents a unique view of dryland climates for a broad spectrum of researchers, environmental professionals and advanced students in climatology, meteorology, geography, environment science, earth system science, ecology, hydrology and geomorphology"--

Summary: As the above lists show, the commonest species (above all Colias palaeno lapponica, Melitaea athalia scandinavica, Polyommatus optilite cyparissus, Episilia alpicola hyperborea, Sympistis melaleuca, Scopula ternata perfumata and Eulype subhastata moestata) are not confined to one biotope but live in different habitats. Hence rare species which live exclusively or mainly in one biotope characterise the biotope...

Abstract: The present paper on habitat selection and clutch-size of the Meadow-pipit (Anthus pratensis) in Finland is based on 282 nest-records from different part of the country. Treeless places (moors, meadows, heaths, islets, shores, etc.) appeared to be favourite nesting habitats, in Lapland also not dense mountain birch forests 4 to 6 m high...
