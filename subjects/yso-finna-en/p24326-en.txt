Challenges in Practice and Education is founded on the belief that the forces of globalisation that have affected design practice for decades have, in recent years, manifested themselves in design education as well. The book brings together authors, practitioners and educators from ten countries across six continents, Australia, East Germany, the UK, the US, Mexico, Hong Kong, Finland, Central India, Greece and South Africa. Each contributor addresses radical design, architecture, art and politics and offers an overview of the socio-cultural and economic factors that affect the built environment in their particular region of the world. They discuss how the practices of architecture, interior design, planning and landscape architecture interact with these forces but, equally as importantly, how design education does the same. The contributions reveal that the issues that challenge us are more than just aesthetic. As concerns increase about the impacts of global environmental change, we are becoming increasingly aware that we struggle to understand the unique ecology and complex diverse cultures which characterise different cities. These, from a landscape architecture perspective, can be seen to be influenced by climate change, technological change, diminishing resources, pollution, water quality, energy sources and population dynamics. To respond to such challenges requires exploring new models of urbanism and place-making which encompass local perspectives and knowledge. It is clear that ‘one size fits all’ approaches will not do. Design for a Complex Worldpoints to the need to develop aesthetic and compositional ability together with the acquisition of technical and design knowledge. This may well require combined courses in town and country planning, urban design, architecture, interior design, landscape and environmental design.

"Debates in Art and Design Teaching encourages student and practising teachers to engage with contemporary issues and developments in Art and Design teaching and education. It introduces key issues, concepts and tensions in order to help you develop a critical approach and respond to the changing fields of education and visual culture. Accessible, comprehensive chapters will stimulate thinking and understanding in relation to theory and practice, and help you to reach your own informed judgements and argue your point of view with deeper theoretical knowledge and understanding. With contributions from expert teachers and artists, who consider their own experience in a wide range of issues, key debates covered include: - The latest policy and initiatives in primary and secondary art education - The concepts, skills and dispositions that can be developed through art education - Tensions inherent in developing the inclusive Art and Design classroom - Partnerships across the visual arts sector - Creativity in the Art and Design curriculum - Visual art and globalisation - Digital technologies for the art classroom - Effective assessment - Combatting the demise of 'Design'. Debates in Art and Design Teaching is for all student and practising teachers interested in furthering their understanding of this exciting, ever-changing field, and supports teachers in articulating how Art and Design is a vital, engaging and necessary part of the 21st century curriculum. It includes carefully annotated further reading and reflective questions to help shape your own research and writing, and provides an essential introduction to critical thinking and contemporary debate".

"The oral eye is a metaphor for the dominance of global designer capitalism. It refers to the consumerism of a designer aesthetic by the 'I' of the neoliberalist subject, as well as the aural soundscapes that accompany the hegemony of the capturing attention through screen cultures. An attempt is made to articulate the historical emergence of such a synoptic machinic regime drawing on Badiou, Bellmer, Deleuze, Guattari, Lacan, Rancir̈e, Virilio, Ziarek, and Zizek to explore contemporary art (post-Situationism) and visual cultural education. Jagodzinski develops the concept of an 'avant-garde without authority,' 'self-refleXion' and 'in(design)' to further the questions surrounding the posthuman as advanced by theorists such as Hansen, Stiegler and Ziarek's 'force' of art"--
