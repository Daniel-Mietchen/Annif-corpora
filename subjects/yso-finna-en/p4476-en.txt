The purpose of this study is to describe how the ethical guidelines of nursing are implemented in the nursing care of substance-abusing mothers according to the nurses of medical and surgical wards. No previous studies had been conducted about the subject from this point of view. The aim is to raise awareness about the nursing care of substance-abusing mothers.  Qualitative research method was chosen and data was gathered through theme interviews. The interview themes were autonomy, confidentiality, equality and individuality. The ethical guidelines of nursing were used as a theoretical background for the study and the results were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The study was done in collaboration with Tampere University Hospital by interviewing four nurses working in either medical or surgical wards.  The results revealed that there are certain factors, which deteriorate the implementation of the ethical guidelines of nursing such as existing prejudices, lack of resources and not having experience on the nursing care of substance-abusing patients. The supporting factors include utilizing multi-professional co-operation, having a primary nurse and supporting motherhood and mother-child relationship  By recognizing the importance of ethical guidelines of nursing the quality of the nursing care can be improved. The study offers knowledge about the current status of the nursing care of substance-abusing mothers in medical and surgical wards. Nurses working with substance-abusing mothers will benefit from this study, because it will make them more aware of their own actions and raise further discussion about the subject. As a further research suggestion, it is recommended to study the nursing care from the point of view of the substance-abusing mothers.  Key concepts: ethical guidelines of nursing, substance abuse, motherhood, nurse-patient relationship

Understanding addiction has never been more important, as many professionals, from counsellors and nurses, to social workers and health psychologists, encounter addictive behaviour on a daily basis. Looking at addiction in all of its forms, this multi-disciplinary book provides a comprehensive introduction to the substances and the activities which can lead to excessive and addictive behaviour. It discusses pharmacological addictions, including both legal and illegal substances. It also covers nonpharmacological dependencies (such as internet addiction, eating disorders, gambling and sexual addiction) which, despite their prevalence, are often absent from the literature on addiction. Drawing on the field's broad evidence base, the book features: a- coverage of eleven types of addictive substances and activities, outlining signs, symptoms, adverse consequences and assessment and intervention strategies for each; a- a range of engaging reflective activities and case studies to link theoretical discussion directly to practice; a- analysis of the broader context of addiction, including dual diagnosis and harm reduction, and issues relating to diversity and service provision. Offering a rigorous introduction to the full spectrum of addictive behaviour, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the nature of addiction for contemporary practice.
