Quality of work life survey
High levels of psychological well-being amongst employees translate into good news for the organization, including lower sickness-absence levels, attraction and retention of talented people, and more satisfied customers, clients, or service users. People with higher levels of psychological well-being work better, live longer and have happier lives. Engagement and well-being can sustain each other and lead to a healthier and more productive organization, a win-win for employees and employers.

This important cultural analysis tells two stories about food. The first depicts good food as democratic. Foodies frequent 'hole in the wall' ethnic eateries, appreciate the pie found in working-class truck stops, and reject the snobbery of fancy French restaurants with formal table service. The second story describes how food operates as a source of status and distinction for economic and cultural elites, indirectly maintaining and reproducing social inequality.

The influence of a green environment and horticultural activities on the subjective well-being of the elderly living in long-term care
The studied topic was recommended to the author by the management team of a small Finnish restaurant chain, which looked for new ways to enhance service quality in today's increasingly competitive restaurant business.  The aim of the study was to examine the service orientation of the contact staff (waiters and bartenders, in contact with the customers) of a specific restaurant located in Helsinki, Finland. The focus was on identifying the different variables affecting employee service orientation. These variables were then used to measure how well the contact staff managed their duties and interacted with the customer in different kinds of circumstance, primarily aims at finding the ideal working conditions in which the contact staff will be most service oriented and able to deliver good service. Questionnaire survey methodology was used to collect data from 18 out of 25 possible employees working as contact employees in the restaurant. Respondents provided self-assessed attribute information relating to external and internal factors affecting employee service orientation.  Results suggests that the majority of the restaurant contact employees were service orientated, positively encouraged by the restaurant management's support, as well they were able to provide good service during busy periods, and had such personality traits that suggest that they were service orientation minded employees. However, closer analysis also showed significant negative ratings on employees' recognition and rewards ratings, which indicate need for improvement.

The purpose for this thesis was to create a survival kit where the exchange students coming to Salo campus of Turku University of Applied Sciences could find answers to all the most frequently asked questions about Salo and what it offers. The outcome was booklet which can be handed to all the incoming exchange students. There is also an electronic version that it can be downloaded from the website of TUAS. The aim for doing this booklet was to ease the work load of the international office and to help the exchange students and the student tutors to get to know Salo better. The booklet was done by first assessing what information is needed. The different sights in  Salo were restricted according to location or interes factor. This was also a requirement since the purpose was to create a booklet and not a book. Collecting the information was easy since the information was readily available but in many different sources. After all information was collected it was written in rather simple English for everybody to understand. The actual booklet was created with a program called Adobe InDesign. This part of the process needed  only placing the text and self-taken pictures in a logical and pleasant way. The finished booklet was given to a few exchange students for feedback and possible improvements. The feedback was mainly positive with e.g. a praise from a student who had stayed in Salo for eight months already. Exchange students would like have more information about organized events. Overall there was hardly anything that they would want to change/added. The few ideas that came up or will come up in the future can easily be added later on, especially to the e-version.

Nowadays, the success of every company or organization depends on the satisfaction of its customers. This is especially obvious in the hospitality sector. The success of a company operating in the hospitality environment has a direct relation to customer satisfaction with its ability to satisfy customers need. The hospitality industry was chosen for this thesis because it covers most activities within customer care, which will be easy to measure at customer satisfaction level. Also the choice of Peacock City Hotel as a case study was due to several reasons such as, its reputation and credibility of being a four star hotel in Tanzania, and also because the writer of the thesis believed it could serve as a sources of learning material. The study aimed especially to find out and analyze what customer satisfaction level of service was delivered at Peacock City hotel (PCH) and the strategies used by the management to ensure customer satisfaction level in service delivery of the hotel. The case study design was used to conduct the study information in order to fulfill the purpose of the study. This thesis is a quantitative research, and the main sources of data collection methods are primary and secondary data collection. Primary data collection methods were face to face interviews with employees, observations of hotel services and operations, as well as a questionnaire designed for hotel guests and management. Secondary data was collected from articles, journals, books and websites. SERVQUAL tool was used to measure customer satisfaction level. The study findings have shown that to ensure customer satisfaction it is important to concentrate on service delivery; the management should identify the needs of the customers; motivate the employees and collect feedback from customers. The study findings show also that there is a medium level of customer satisfaction with service provided by the hotel. In order to improve customer satisfaction level, the study finally provides some recommendations for the management of Peacock City Hotel for improving its service quality in order to achieve a higher level of customer satisfaction.

Towards bully-free schools
Bossy and autocratic superiors. Non-managers - lax, lazy or unassertive in their work. Difficult personalities, piggy-backers, bullies and avengers - the styles of work behavior are many. Neglect of client needs, maltreatment and maximisation of personal benefit. Unresolved conflicts. The problems are prevalent and familiar. Why is nothing done about them? The answer is the Evil Eleven Syndrome. The book describes the dark side of workplaces, weakening both wellbeing and performance. The theoretical frame of reference is the X Efficiency theory of organisational economics. With the help of this innovative theory it is possible to explain, conceptualise and understand phenomena that traditional economic theory does not address. The book examines organisational inefficiency from the perspective of human decision-making, work behaviour and pressures. The individual level is important, because organisational performance is based on the productivity of work.

The purpose of this thesis is to determine factors that lead to a successful insourcing process. The insourcing process has been finalized and is functioning. The objectives of the thesis are to determine what the factors are that makes the outsourcing a bad option for Clinic D. And at the same time it determines what the factors that make the insourcing process tangible are. The author has used methodology that supports both the qualitative and quantitative research method. Interviews with department supervisors and questioning employees with the help of a questionnaire will help understand outsourcing and insourcing better. Outsourcing has been a trend for a long time and it is still going on. But organizations are realizing that not all operations, departments, tasks and projects are suitable for outsourcing and they are reconsidering their position. Many do decide to insource and the author wants to help these organizations to make a successful decision based on good research. Taking into account many things in this process is important as it is a great step in an organizations function. one need to weigh out all the options, pros and cons that in the end leads to the final decision. One needs to consider the whole organization when deciding such a change as it will affect the whole organization, not only the insourcing department or section. The results of the research have been positive and will be a good example for other organizations considering a similar transaction. This will show what the result of the insourcing process has done to the clinic and what affect it has had.
