This article focuses on the most recent internationalisation of Finnish forest companies. The profiles of the major companies are analysed. A 'world map' is drawn to illustrate the gradual formation of forest-industrial spaces in three scales: the articulation of Finnish (national) forest interest is related to the strategic openings of the Finnish forest companies within European (continental) and global (transcontinental) contexts. The suggested world map covers both the active exporting of the 'Finnish model' and the subsequent new location of Finland in the international networks. Both material and symbolic dimensions of the process are highlighted. The slow dynamics of the paper production is set against the current fluidity of societal demands that are fed by intensifying competition between the leading companies, profit maximation among the shareholders, and keen steering by globally aware environmentalists and consumers. Finally, the eco-social consequences of the contested globalisation process are addressed by examining the most controversial signs and signals. These include size ranking of the companies, profit hunting, image and identity politics, and product certifications. The theoretical framework is based on the political-ecology literature inspired by actor- and context-specific approaches. Hence, the aim is a simultaneous analysis of both material and symbolic changes in forest industrial practices.

"If you are responsible for protecting your company's assets, then you know that risk assessment means more than simply identifying security vulnerabilities; it also means measuring their likelihood, prioritizing them, assessing their risk of occurrence, and measuring their impact on your organization's assets. Failure to consider all of these elements could constitute a violation of standard security industry practices. This valuable resource will help you develop the necessary strategies for conducting comprehensive risk assessments"--Publisher's website.

This paper is based on a major study by the HSE's Institute for Industrial and Market Studies (IIMS) on competitiveness of Russian manufacturing enterprises. The study seeks to identify the drivers and dynamics of business competitiveness, focusing particularly on behavior adjustments of firms in the period 2005-2008 and the lead-up to the global financial crisis. Using the study findings, we attempt to ascertain which firms succeeded (and the extent to which they succeeded) in capitalizing on the strong economic growth before the 2008 global financial crisis. We then ask if these firms managed to catch up with their competitors and secure sustainable competitive positions in the market, as well as identify the bases for output increases and enhanced production efficiency. .

The use of network-based business models has been brought up as a means of creating com-petitive edge in the tightening global competition. In practice, adopting network-based models has not yet become common in the wood products industry. The objective of this study is to gain better understanding of types of network-based business models using a case study of two small and medium-sized wood industry companies in Finland (for a sake of anonymity named as A and B). The network of company A is found to consist of mostly of established actors with a new-in-the-market value creation system, whereas network for company B is more stable and has an established value system aiming at growth and incremental innovations. Both networks had experienced difficulties in finding partners and lacked some strategic resources. Via this example we wish to stimulate further research interest on the sources of network-based competitive advantage in the traditional wood product industry in a need of renewal of business models..
