"A fabulous resource for graduate advisors" Eric Mazur, Harvard University Successful Research Supervision offers a research-based practical framework for academics to be able to examine and further develop their effectiveness as research supervisors. Research supervisors working in all levels of higher education must ensure that their students gain efficiencies from working as part of an effective cohort and develop high levels of interdisciplinary understanding and critical thought. To impart these disciplines effectively is essential for any successful research supervisor. From helping researchers to begin to managing a project through to successful completion, this book guides the reader through a series of exercises to identify their individual strengths and weaknesses and then provides theoretically sound advice in a practical and easy to use format. Successful Research Supervision is full of examples of the best practice from outstanding scientists, social scientists and humanities supervisors from both the UK and the USA. This book will encourage and help academics to: - Expand their own repertoire and array of actions and responses, thus giving them the flexibility to meet different situations with ease and confidence - Identify the optimum combination of approaches to best fit individual students - Understand the influence of their own value and experiences in the choice of their approach to research students - Be able to choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for a particular curriculum or project - Employ a neutral language for developing and assisting others"--

In information systems (IS) research, there is increasing interest in understanding complex and large-scale efforts. This study examines the complexity involved in infrastructuring within a novel context: the educational network of a Finnish city. A unique aspect is this study’s focus on children’s participation in infrastructuring. It contributes to the existing body of literature by addressing the concepts of discourses in place, interaction order, and historical body, as drawn from nexus analysis. It offers these concepts as theoretical tools for understanding the complexity of infrastructuring, and furthers exploration of user participation in IS research through a careful analysis of actor participation in the infrastructuring venture in question. The findings of this study foreground a multitude of actors, both adults and children, as well as their various activities and the versatility of the involved objects of design. The central social actors include educational officials, schools (teachers, headmasters, and pupils), researchers, and local and global companies.Infrastructuring in this research includes planned activities concerning developed solutions, but also emergent activities for adapting planned solutions to local schools’ everyday practices, revealing the intimate intertwining of practices and technologies. In particular, the past temporal horizon and shared histories of the communities involved are highlighted in terms of the concept of the historical body. The analysis on the historical bodies of the actors foregrounded the local aspects that were appreciated, but also challenged in infrastructuring. The concept of interaction order was found to be useful for analyzing the heterogeneity, multivoicedness, tensions between local and global dimensions, and power aspects inherent in infrastructuring As a practical implication, the nexus analytic conce pts of historical body and interaction order are suggested as means of better understanding local settings and the power relationships of various actors, and are also useful for practitioners preparing for infrastructuring.

Academic identities and policy change in higher education
The Cambridge companion to Durkheim
This book analyses higher education from cultural perspectives and also to reflect on the uses of intellectual devices developed in the cultural studies of higher education over the last decades. The first part of the book presents fresh perspectives to integrate cultural studies in higher education with wider societal processes. Professor William G. Tierney speaks about trust and culture in higher education, whereas Professor Imanol Ordorika opens a political perspective to higher education institutions. The second part of the book studies the internal life of higher education. Relying on a variety of cultural perspectives, the chapters explore the actual day-to-day practices taking place in higher education, ranging from student socialisation, student consumerism, tensions in combining academic and market-oriented targets in knowledge production to the formation of academic identities in different disciplinary and organisational cultures. The focus in the third part of the book is to use cultural perspectives developed in previous studies on disciplinary and organisational cultures as a framework to understand a variety of processes and reforms taking place at the institutional level of high education. The chapters in this part of the book analyse the Bologna Process, the evolution of scientific fields in American universities, organisational cultures in Chinese post-merger universities, and doctoral education and cooperation with industry.

"This collection of articles explores how a wide range of academics-- diverse in location, rank and discipline-- understand and express how they deal with spirituality in their professional lives and how they integrate spirituality in teaching, research, administration, and advising. The contributors also analyze the culture of academia and its challenges to the spiritual development of those involved. Twenty chapter authors--from a variety of faith traditions--discuss the ways in which their own beliefs have affected their journeys through higher education. By using an autoethnographic, self-analytical lens, this collection shows how various spiritualities have influenced how higher education is understood, taught and performed. The book will stimulate debate and conversations on a topic traditionally ignored in academia"-- Provided by publisher.

This book presents the analysis of the representative survey about the academic profession in twelve European countries. Higher education in Europe has experienced a substantial change in recent years: Expansion progresses further, the expectation to deliver useful contributions of knowledge to the “knowledge society” is on the rise, and efforts to steer academic work through external forces and strong international management are more widespread than ever. Representative surveys of the academic profession in twelve European countries show how professors and junior staff at universities and other institutions of higher education view the role of higher education in society and their professional situation and how they actually shape their professional tasks. Academics differ across Europe substantially in their employment and working conditions, their views and their activities. Most of them favour the preservation of a close link between teaching and research and feel responsible for both theory and practice. Most consider efforts to enhance academic quality and social relevance as compatible. The overall satisfaction with their professional situation is rather high. --Publisher's description.

The volume offers state-of-the art contributions in the intersection of academic profession, research training and institutional governance. They reflect the profound interest of contemporary researchers in the questions of how the contemporary higher education reforms across Europe affect university governance and especially the roles and functions of academics. The volume includes several contributions from the peripheral and developing higher education systems of Central and South-East Europe; hence, attempting to rebalance the European profile of higher education research and at the same time contribute to the most salient debates in the field. This book confirms, once again, that the higher education research landscape is a diverse and rich one. At the same time, these diverse cases have at least one commonality – the fact that even though they are located in different higher education systems, they address issues that, albeit as a rule context-specific, can be found in all parts of Europe and beyond. Certainly, the local responses to the hereby addressed global challenges represent a mere snapshot of a broader landscape the European higher education dynamics is.
