Major trauma in Northern Finland
We tested if hand-carried field proximal soil sensing (PSS) can be used to map the distribution of anthropogenic Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE). ADE soils are rich in archaeological artefacts, nutrients, organic matter and carbon in the very stable form of pyrogenic carbon, also referred to as black carbon or biochar. To test the capacity of PSS to detect signature ADE properties we measured electrical conductivity (ECa), magnetic susceptibility (MSa) and gamma ray data by transect sampling and compared these readings, using fuzzy classification, with datasets on chemical soil properties from a 28 ha large study area located on the Belterra Plateau of the Lower Amazon in northern Brazil. Results indicate that ECa and MSa measurements were good indicators of ADE signatures, but that the gamma radiation sensor was less useful in the deeply weathered soils. PSS and fuzzy classification can be used for rapid field mapping of ADE for both agricultural and archaeological purposes.

"This important resource bridges the gap between imaging, optics, and photonics, and statistics and data analysis. The text contains a wide range of relevant statistical methods including a review of the fundamentals of statistics and expanding into multivariate techniques. The techniques are explained in the context of real examples from remote sensing, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, signal processing, color science, and other related disciplines. The book also emphasizes intuitive and geometric understanding of concepts. The topics that are most relevant to imaging, optics, and photonics applications are covered thoroughly. In addition, supplemental topics are discussed to provide an overview of when and how the methods can be used".

The purpose of the research is to find out the differences in luxury hotel marketing depending on the category affordable luxury and luxury. Additionally, its purpose is to outline and compare the status of luxury tourism industry and the state of super luxury in Austria and Finland and why Austria or Finland do not have super luxury category to offer to their luxury travellers.  The method of the research was qualitative and the research was carried out as half structured in-depth interviews, which included experts from Finnish Tourism Board, Finland Travel Bureau and the chartered management consultant and certified hotelier from Austria as well as marketing and communication representatives from Palace K√§mp Group and Hotel Altstadt Vienna. Altogether 29 persons, decision bodies or hotels were contacted to take part to the research. The results of the research were analysed manually by reading notes and transcripts.  The main focus of the research was on the marketing differences according to the luxury hotel category. Thus no interview partners were managed to obtain from the luxury category, was it impossible to compare the results and therefore only the affordable luxury category is being introduced and analysed in this thesis. While only six experts took part in the research, the results have a relatively large margin of error and consequently cannot be generalized. The answers and results should only be used as trend-setting examples.  What was found out during the research, were the characteristics of affordable luxury category, as already among three interviewees the saturation was fulfilled in some cases. All the interview hotels fulfilled the qualities of luxury travel; they all offer freedom of choice and unstructured experiences as all of the hotels aimed to offer individual packages for the customers. Freedom from shackles of time and high standards of personal service were reached by offering quality service and fulfilling customer's every wish and freedom to be casual in lifestyle as casualty was emphasised by all of the interview partners. Elegant amenities as well as excellent cuisine were additionally offered in the Finnish partner hotels.  To draw a conclusion, Finland is lags behind Austria in luxury tourism on a general level. Yet, what should be taken into consideration when comparing these destinations is the structure of the industry and the different possibilities of both countries. Albeit both countries are strong winter destinations, the focus of luxury offer is different; in Finland the possibilities lie in adventure holidays and extreme experiences with snow, darkness and isolation, whereas in Austria taking care of mental and physical side of the individual is the main focus by offering luxurious spas and resorts.
