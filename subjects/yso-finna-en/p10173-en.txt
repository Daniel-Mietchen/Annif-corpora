The aim of this thesis was to improve methods for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and terphenyl (PCT) analytics with the equipment that was available, examine leaching of PCBs and PCTs from sample material and also determine the amount of mentioned compounds in the sample material. PCBs and PCTs have been widely used in products such as cooling liquids, flame retardant and additives in paints, printing inks and surfactants before environmental problems they cause were discovered.     For PCB- and PCT-analytics there was available gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and a compatible non-polar column. Based on the literature, a mid-polar column would have been the best option, but it was not available. In analytics of PCBs and PCTs, the thing that makes analysis challenging is the similarity of different compounds, so called congeners. Their retention times and mass spectra are very close to each other. In addition, in samples there is usually either very high or very low concentration of PCBs and PCTs and that further complicates analytics. In this thesis, sample material was ground waste from a storage room of an elementary school located in Tampere. The total amount of PCBs and PCTs in this material and leaching of them into water was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.     Contrary to preliminary information, no PCT-compounds were found from the sample material, so in this study attention was paid to analytics of Aroclor 1260 PCB mixture, for it was found from the sample material. The temperature program of gas chromatograph and ions to be monitored with mass spectrometer were chosen to be optimal for that exact PCB mixture. From the sample material was found about 3 700 mg of PCB compounds per kilogram of ground waste. This amount exceeds the limit of hazardous waste and thus has to be treated as hazardous waste. However, leaching of PCBs into the water was minimal, as highest 0.01 % of the PCB amount the waste contained.    All in all, compared to old methods used, there was change in temperature program, ions to be monitored and way of preparing standard solutions. In the future PCB and PCT analytics could be further promoted by creating respective methods also for other PCB and PCT mixtures. In this way analytics of other PCB and PCT mixtures can also be done in a highly reliable manner.        Keywords: Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated terphenyls, GC-MS.

This thesis was carried out during the summer and autumn of 2009 in the Quality Control Department of an African pharmaceutical manufacturing plant Universal Corporation Ltd. (UCL). The aim of the thesis was to develop and validate an HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) method for simultaneous analysis of artesunate and amodiaquine from an antimalarial drug called "Double Layer Tablets". Because of Double Layer Tablets being a new product to be launched, any validated method for its analysis did not exist in the Quality Control Laboratory. Therefore, the development of the method had to be based on the knowledge of separate analyses of the substances and the test analyses made in the laboratory with one combined method. In this thesis common method validation parameters such as linearity and accuracy were tested.    Earlier test analyses had cleared out that the most complicated problem in this simultaneous analysis was to get the responses of artesunate and amodiaquine closer to each others values. While amodiaquine was giving a very decent peak (response), the response for artesunate was significantly smaller than could be expected on the ground of the one tablet concentration. The difference in response magnitudes made simultaneous analysis more inaccurate and difficult to interpret so the attention was to be paid to the HPLC parameters of the method. In hope of changing the ratio of responses, the detection wavelength used in the test analyses was changed. Spectra of both artesunate and amodiaquine were found out and from them two most potential wavelength chosen for the analyses.     The aim of getting artesunate and amodiaquine analyzed with one method at the same time and getting the peaks in same scale was not reached by these changes made. Artesunate was still giving responses that were not meeting the requirements.    Although simultaneous analysis did not succeed by these changes, there is still some hope to get the method working. The detection wavelength could be changed again and the effects of it in practise checked in the same way as in this thesis. If in the future the detection still seems to be the biggest problem of a combined method, the active ingredients should probably be analyzed separately with their own methods known to be working.  .
