This bachelor thesis includes two parts: artistic and written. The artistic part of this thesis was a solo concert, which was held on March 16, 2011 at Sigyn-hall, Turku, Finland. The concert is a main part of this thesis. The purpose of the concert was to experience my organizational skills and to challenge myself as a solo-violinist and chamber musician. The concert program included pieces of five different genres. In the second part of the concer was a piano quintet by Shostakovich. In addition to me, in the concert were playing also following instrumentalists: Eri Itoh (violin), Inka Heilimö (viola), Anni Manninen (cello) and Mikael Kemppainen (piano). The concert poster, program and CD are attached in the end of this thesis. The written part of this thesis deals with performing practice and particularly, the problem of anxiety (fear) on the stage. The main emphasis in the written part of thesis is given to identify the reasons of musician's anxiety which exposes many of our mistakes and shortcomings. My purpose is to define helping means to handle it.
