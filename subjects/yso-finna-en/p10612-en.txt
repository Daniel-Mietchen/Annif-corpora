The fruit machine : twenty years of writings on queer cinema
For more than twenty years, film critic, teacher, activist, and fan Thomas Waugh has been writing about queer movies. As a member of the Jump Cut collective and contributor to the Toronto-based gay newspaper the Body Politic, he emerged in the late 1970s as a pioneer in gay film theory and criticism, and over the next two decades solidified his reputation as one of the most important and influential gay film critics. The Fruit Machine - a collection of Waugh's reviews and articles originally published in gay community tabloids, academic journals, and anthologies - charts the emergence and maturation of Waugh's critical sensibilities while lending an important historical perspective to the growth of film theory and criticism as well as queer moviemaking.
