Foreign accent : the phenomenon of non-native speech
Stress and non-stress accent
On the grammar and semantics of sentence accents
Applying a sociophonetic research paradigm, this volume presents an investigation of variation and change in the Scottish Standard English accent. Based on original audio recordings made in Edinburgh, it provides detailed acoustic and auditory analyses of selected accent features. In contrast to other studies of English in Scotland, the focus is on the extent to which certain characteristics of middle-class speech are susceptible (or immune) to the influence of Southern Standard British English, or vary in ways unrelated to that influence. Beyond the fine-grained patterns of variation that are revealed, the study highlights innovative methodological approaches to sociophonetic variation and contributes to a better general understanding of the status and function of Scottish Standard English. The book will be of general interest to sociolinguists and sociophoneticians, and of particular interest to researchers or students concerned with phonetic or phonological aspects of Scottish English.
"Investigating English Pronunciation: Trends and Directions is a cutting-edge update on the latest research in the field of English pronunciation. The volume provides readers with fully-developed examples of the latest trends and research topics in English pronunciation from specialists in Europe, Asia, and the United States. These include, amongst others, segmental and suprasegmental features in L1 and L2 varieties of English, sociophonetic or sound-symbolic aspects of pronunciation, and applications such as English pronunciation teaching and learning. The contributions to the volume deal with original topics and make use of a wide variety of methods in researching English pronunciation, illustrating these through a series of selected case studies, and providing readers with a number of novel and motivating questions that will inspire further research"--

"To what extent do our accents determine the way we are perceived by others? Is foreign accent inevitably associated with social stigma? Accent is a matter of great public interest given the impact of migration on national and global affairs, but until now, applied linguistics research has treated accent largely as a theoretical puzzle. In this fascinating account, Alene Moyer examines the social, psychological, educational and legal ramifications of sounding 'foreign'. She explores how accent operates contextually through analysis of issues such as: the neuro-cognitive constraints on phonological acquisition, individual factors that contribute to the 'intractability' of accent, foreign accent as a criterion for workplace discrimination, and the efficacy of instruction for improving pronunciation. This holistic treatment of second language accent is an essential resource for graduate students and researchers interested in applied linguistics, bilingualism and foreign language education"--
