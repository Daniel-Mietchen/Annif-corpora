What is it that makes some children bully and some become victims? What can you do if despite your best efforts, a child keeps on taunting another? What steps can you take before communicating with parents and what will you say? The practice of bullying endures in all schools today. Despite the implementation of bullying policies, parents and staff can be equally perplexed: not really understanding what they have or haven't done to allow it to happen. Christine Macintyre explores this highly emotive topic, asking why as many as one in 12 school children are bullying victims, and will show in a highly practical way, what can be done to support the children and help staff improve their own practice. This book will provide help and guidance on: enhancing the self-esteem of the affected children, showing how new-found confidence will enable children to offset the effects of being bullied or indeed being a bully; how to tell parents their child is bullying or being bullied, and how to build up a meaningful and mutually supportive relationship with them; and, creating a learning environment that prevents the desire for children to bully. Based on case studies giving first hand accounts of real-life situations, and evaluations of strategies that have been tried and tested, this book suggests fresh and inspiring ways of tackling a problem faced by many practitioners today.

From an early age, deaf children excel in thinking about and remembering what they learn through visual spatial instruction. This strength in information processing can be used in the mathematics classroom to achieve better learning outcomes.  This book discusses ways to teach deaf children about the four arithmetic operations through spatial representation in problem solving. Examples for the teaching of fractions and graphs are also included. These visual representations are useful to support the children's understanding of mathematical concepts and to promote peer collaboration.  The teaching programme was tested with deaf children in six schools with excellent results: the children in the project made significantly more progress in one school year than expected for either deaf and hearing children over the same time.

Music has always been an essential part of what it is to be human and yet not everyone has access to the music-based opportunities others take for granted. Motivated by the belief that individuals are disabled by society rather than any impairment they might have, Jane Williams sets out to show how someone with learning difficulties can engage with music in as many diverse and fulfilling ways as the rest of their community and generation. This practical guide will equip you with everything you need to know to help empower people with learning difficulties to experience and enjoy music, meaningfully. It sets out activity ideas in the context of existing Occupational Therapy models and offers a host of tips, resources and ready-to-use themed lesson plans to inspire and enrich your practice. There are also many practical examples and real-life success stories that show how to put the theory into practice, including downloadable tracks composed and performed by The LA Buskers, a band Jane works with. Accessible, practical and inspirational, the unique approaches described in this book will be of immeasurable interest to occupational therapists, social care workers responsible for planning and delivering activity programmes as well as community musicians.

The effects of hearing impairments on learning, social development and family life can be profound. They can impact on attachment, parenting and family interaction, and can affect cognitive and neuropsychological processes including perception and memory.  This guide draws on the latest evidence to explain the impact of hearing impairment and uses case studies to focus on the key issues for assessment and intervention. It also suggests practical strategies for treatment and development for those working with hearing impaired children.

This timely book provides a reflective analysis of person centred planning for people with learning disabilities, complementing policy initiatives that focus on individualised planning and service user involvement. Drawing on practical experience and research findings, the contributors explore policy and practice issues, including: advocacy and empowerment; risk management and adult protection; inter-agency and inter-professional working; ethnicity and culture; de-institutionalisation. Vivid case studies illustrate best practice in person centred planning, and the authors offer a rich variety.

The book covers: - how to use both informal and formal assessment procedures - frameworks for evaluating published and teacher-made assessments - the professional development needs of any teacher involved in assessment Ideal for those training to be specialist teachers of learners with dyslexia, this text is equally useful to all teachers and SENCOS (Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators) and complements the authors' book Teaching Literacy to Learners with Dyslexia to provide comprehensive guidance for assessing and teaching learners with dyslexic-type difficulties. Sylvia Phillips is an experienced Special Educational Needs educator, and currently leads Glyndwr University's specialist course for teachers of learners with dyslexia.
