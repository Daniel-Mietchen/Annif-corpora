Libertine is an invitation into Johnson Hartig's world, as the designer shares images of his eccentric and whimsical fashion designs, inspirational references, and his captivatingly eclectic interiors. Johnson Hartig is the founder and designer for the innovative fashion brand Libertine, which is renowned for breathing electric life back into vintage couture pieces by cutting them up and adding ornate crystal embellishments, rich silk-screened graphics, and embroideries to create gorgeous one-of-a-kind garments. With an uncanny ability to combine unexpected colors, patterns, and textures, Hartig has created a style that is youthful and edgy yet undeniably glamorous and sophisticated. A hopeless traditionalist yet a rule breaker, Hartig's personal style was initially what inspired the brand, and this eclectic philosophy permeates all parts of his life.

"Retro is hip, and vintage is cult. The esthetics of past eras are back in style in the world of fashion, as well as interior and product design. Brands successfully reissue old originals, while creative professionals around the world design innovative products with a retro look. Their scope of inspiration extends from Bauhaus to hip-hop. This volume presents comebacks and new interpretations, products and styles that are more fashionable today than ever before. Between the opposing poles of nostalgia and high-tech, the designers prove their niftiness and sense of humor. Whether kidney-shaped tables, aviator glasses, or printable radios, the past is returning full of charm and with a twinkle in the eye. Retro & vintage design serves as a reference book of design history and a source of inspiration for trend-setters at the same time."--Back cover.
