Lego(r) -based therapy : how to build social competence through LEGO(r) -based clubs for children with autism and related conditions
Traditional therapy can often be an off-putting experience for boys as it is in direct opposition to the ways they generally interact and connect with others. This book explores a variety of creative approaches that professionals can use to enhance the clinical experience and better reach their young male clients. Chapters discuss the theory behind and implementation of various creative approaches to therapy with boys, such as play therapy, including sports, movement, and gross-motor activity; animal-assisted therapy; the use of video games and computers; the use of superheroes in role play, metaphor, and play therapy; and art therapy. Attention is also given to methods for working with several subgroups of boys that require specialized treatment approaches, including gender variant and sexual minority boys and boys with ADHD. The first book of its kind, mental health professionals will find this a comprehensive and highly valuable text to help them understand, help, and support boys and their development.
