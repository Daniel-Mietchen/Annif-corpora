The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the operating principles of and differences between various kinds of test benches as well as the functionality of their test bulletins. The thesis was commissioned by Wärtsilä Finland Oy in order to shed light on the use of test benches and bulletins. Sources of information were Wärtsilä`s test bulletins, databases and employees. All practical work for the thesis was carried out at Wärtsilä`s research laboratory in Turku. First, basic information about the Wärtsilä 46 and 50DF diesel engines, fuel injectors and test bulletins is provided. Then, the test benches and testing procedures are described. Finally, the improvements made to the test benches and their properties are illustrated. The thesis was a success. It provides valuable information on the use of various test benches and test bulletins and clarifies several problems that can be encountered during testing.

Expanded and updated new edition of the author's Handbook of Marine Surveying. Aimed at students of marine surveying, professional marine surveyors, boatyard operators and technically-minded boat owners, it covers the latest marine surveying technology, including analysis of the mechanical behaviour of materials, failure analysis, stress concentration, fatigue and fracture, corrosion, wood-damaging organisms, polymer chemistry, and the composition and characteristics of common plastics, metal, alloys and composite materials. There is also a useful survey checklist that provides practical techniques and hints for conducting a survey. 'A mass of information on different materials used in boatbuilding plus their failure mechanisms.
