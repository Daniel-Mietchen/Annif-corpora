The Internet of Things is all about machines trading with machines - your fridge orders groceries; your car, fuel; your television, entertainment; and so on. However, machines cannot trade with machines if it's expensive and slow. Would you really want your TV to order the next season of Games of Thrones, if the payment took ten days and cost 25 or more? Unfortunately with the way the bank system works today, that is the problem we face today. As a result, we need an Internet of Value to work with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Value - or ValueWeb, for short - allows machines to trade.

Abstract.
Skip Allums designs next-generation mobile banking and payments experiences for some of the world's largest financial service providers. In this book, he offers on-the-ground insights into present and future design patterns in this space, as well as lessons learned and common pitfalls. With mobile devices emerging as new tools for transactions and identification, designers face challenging interactions and user expectations from payment scenarios. Consumers expect mobile payment experiences to be frictionless and familiar, while faithfully protecting their financial data. Falling short on either of these aspects will cause users to drop out, or worse, compromise their financial privacy. To help designers meet these challenges, this book provides a primer on the world of mobile commerce, as well as user experience best practices.
