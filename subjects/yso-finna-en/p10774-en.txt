Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to identify possibilities for Case Company which helps to manage sales price changes more efficiently and which would be following the raw material price changes. The need for the development was raised from the challenges in current quarterly set sales price which problems writer has faced in his every day work as a Sales Manager for Case Company. Objective of this thesis was to eventually create a proposal for the price mechanism, with a “bank” –feature and by using this mechanism the problems deriving for the quarterly set price would be avoided.  The thesis work focused on studying if Case Company industry specific raw material indexes were possible to use as a part of the problem solution in a way towards the objective. For that purpose four relevant raw material indexes were presented and those were also analyzed against two Case Company's cost bases. The possibility to use these indexes in mechanism comes through the correlation between a particular raw material index and Case Company raw material cost base.  Due to the fact that public raw material indexes are not area specific but more or less releasing generic information this thesis work also looked into some influencing fac-tors that has an impact to Case Company raw material cost and through that had a possible impact to correlation. To deepen the knowledge of the presented influencers also an interview was conducted within the Case Company professionals and the an-swers of the interview were used to identify the most reliable indexes and the impact of the various influencers.  This thesis work found the correlation to exist between the indexes and Case Company cost bases. The accuracy of correlation is dependable on influencers, some more than others, and therefore it was suggested that those influencers needed the focus and was suggested to be studied further. This work was also able to create a price mechanism with a bank feature based on the thesis work findings.
