This book contains critical background information, and recent advances made in essentially all areas of islet research. It is a major reference book, the first of its kind, for islet researchers, and diabetes researchers. Anybody, including the experts, and the beginners, interested in the study of islet physiology, and diabetes, will find this book extremely useful. The book is robust in its breadth: it deals with anatomy, histology, ultra-structure, evolution and comparative anatomy, imaging, developmental biology, programming, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, metabolism, cellular signaling, electrophysiology, oscillation of hormone secretion, islets of model animals, immunology, proteomics, regenerative medicine, clinical advances, and islet transplantation. Individual chapters contributed by a large number of experts and enthusiasts, not only provide a balanced view of the recent advances made in the respective fields, but also provide directions and thoughts for future research. Thanks to vivid and colorful illustrations, tables and sketches, the book as a whole, and the individual chapters make reading a pleasant experience. If you are interested in diabetes research, you will love to have a personal copy of this book.
