Job rotation has become an organizational tool used to widen an employee's perspective by enabling a person to switch between jobs. Yleisradio Oy took on job rotation in an organized way in the beginning of the year 2010. Due to financial cutbacks Yleisradio Oy is downsizing its operations and thus job rotation will become more necessary in the upcoming years. This thesis looks at managing know-how in job rotation with special emphasis on the manager's point of view on different aspects of the subject. This is meant for managers to help them react in situations of change which affect their departments as employees are coming to or leaving from their teams.  Job rotation is still in its early stages in organizations around the globe and thus there is not much research done on the subject. For this thesis primary research was conducted with in-depth interviews of nine managers in Yleisradio Oy. Job rotation influences not only the person taking part in the process but also their colleagues as well as their manager. Benefits of job rotation come to the employee taking part in job rotation, the department where they are leaving from, the department where they are going to as well as the organization as a whole. All these sectors which are influenced by job rotation have different needs and wants concerning the issue. These issues are handled in this thesis to provide insight into their relations with job rotation. Managers are the integral piece in the rotation process. They are the link between all the people affected by employees taking part in job rotation. Managers have to have good leadership skills to take into consideration the feelings of the employee coming to or leaving from their department as well as the rest of their subordinates as the change emerges. Managers also need to have good connections to the human resource department as well as to other managers to share thoughts and bounce ideas so that they have a good support system. This comes up especially when redefining concepts how to better manage the know-how which employees have as they switch jobs.

Managing know-how in job rotation : case: Yleisradio Oy
The changes in the modern environment happen constantly. Individuals and organizations try to cope with the changes. The hotel industry has been showing good economical results globally and in Finland during the recent years, and therefore it is an attractive working environemnt.     The purpose of this qualitative research was to understand the role of mobility in the career paths of the hotel managers in Helsinki. The hotel managers of only one company were interviewed, therefore the results describe the situation in the company X.     The data for this research was collected through literature review, collecting the information about the case company through publicly availabe sources and through informant interview with the company's representative, and through conducting the interviews with eight hotel managers employed by the company X in the Helsinki region. The main research question was: What paths hotel managers of the chain X go through in their careers? Threesupporting research questions were set as well: What role career mobility plays in the career paths of the hotel managers? What types of career mobility are prevalent in the career paths of the hotel managers? What is affecting the individual's decision towards change in the career?    Findings of this study showed that career mobility in career of the hotel managers is represented by developing universal skills, loving own job and networking. Career mobility is rather percieved positively by the hotel managers. The types that are prevalent in the career paths of the hotel managers are physical and pshycological mobility, vertical mobility, moving across the hotel functions and moving across industries. The main affect on the changes in the career have organizational intent and willingness to learn and improve oneself.     It is an interesting topic for the future professionals who are planning to work in Finland in the hotel field as well as for professionals already working in the industry. They can learn from the results of the research that mobility plays an important role in the career paths. Future professional can also see that universal skills acquired especially through experience in front office and food and beverage depatments of a hotel are helpful for the development of a career. Constant learning and imporving oneself are also essential characteristics of career path and should be considered by future professionals.

Today greater responsibilities are being put on regions to shape their own future. Thus, different kinds of regional collaboration arenas have emerged and an increasing number of regional collaboration projects are now crossing both county and nation borders. The object of interest in this study is the Bothnian Arc project. This project involves municipalities on the Swedish and the Finnish side of the Gulf of Bothnia. The aim has been to analyse opinions and experiences of Swedish actors regarding the Bothnian Arc as a region-strengthening project. The article is based on interviews with fourteen municipality representatives and a questionnaire answered by approximately 300 firm managers within the Bothnian Arc area.The Bothnian Arc is essentially a political project and this study shows that the policy creating institutions have not succeeded in transferring ideas and objectives to firms within the area. In fact, only 30 per cent of the firm managers were familiar with the project. More concrete projects adapted to firm interests were required by a few of the municipality representatives. Moreover, the municipalities closest to the Finnish border are more active and involved both on municipal and firm level. This tendency is primarily due to already existing traditions of collaboration with Finnish actors.
