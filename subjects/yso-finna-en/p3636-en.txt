"The traditional view of information security includes three cornerstones: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, also known as the CIA of information security. As the field has become more complex, both novices and professionals with years of experience need a good reference book outlining the basics. Rather than focusing on compliance or policies and procedures, this book takes a top-down approach. Providing insight from the author's experience developing dozens of standards, the book starts with the fundamentals to bridge the understanding gaps--approaching information security from the bedrock principles of CIA"--

This paper is an overview on the Open Government Data (OGD) environment in the EU. It aims to point out the relevant legal issues together with the economic aspects arising from the disclosure and exploitation of OGD. Therefore, the paper highlights the noteworthy technological aspects related with the opening of OGD datasets. This survey is based on an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinarity in the digital environment means that OGD should be considered as an integrated, interoperable and collaborative ecosystem. The main legislative source taken into account for the survey is the Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information as recently amended by the Directive 37/2013/EU..

From one of the world's leading experts in cyberpsychology--a discipline that combines psychology, forensics, and technology--comes a groundbreaking exploration of the impact of technology on human behavior. In the first book of its kind, Mary Aiken applies her expertise in cyber-behavioral analysis to a range of subjects, including criminal activity on the Deep Web and Darknet; deviant behavior; Internet addictions; the impact of technology on the developing child; teenagers and the Web; cyber-romance and cyber-friendships; cyberchondria; the future of artificial intelligence; and the positive effects on our digital selves, such as online altruism.

Scene of the Cybercrime
The existence of dominant companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. result in a dangerous situation in terms of abuses of data protection and data security legislation. It is important to specify the term “dominant” or “dominance” as, in my opinion, the existing definition from a competition law perspective does not apply to the situation concerning privacy and data protection. So far law has not presented any other sufficient way to describe “dominance”..

The purpose of this thesis is based on a daily basis encounter to VoIP and security issues involved. Voice over IP (VoIP) is a telephone technology which converts analogue data signal to digital data and transfer them over the internet. VoIP users and service providers need to be aware that there are ordinary people with the knowledge on how to manipulate the system who are constantly trying to attack VoIP technologies, either for fun or for a worse reason.    The aim of the thesis is to better understand the security threats related to VoIP, the mechanics in how this attacks are carried out and mainly how to secure our communication in our day to day interaction with VoIP technology.    The research is based on written sources, a practical approach to a network analyzer and a supplementary interview conducted. The scope of the thesis is limited to main security threats.    The result of this thesis will ensure that organizations and individuals who are planning to implement or already use VoIP to communicate are taking precautionary measures to avoid security problems such as credential theft, eavesdropping, denial of service and other manipulative misuse of the system.
