The 90-minute DVD, Kinesiology Taping Fundamentals: A Therapist's Guide for Treating Pain and Injury with Kinesiology Tape, provides detailed instructions for over 50 different kinesiology tape applications. Consisting of eight “chapters,” each with its own menu of taping techniques, the DVD represents the perfect marriage of the theoretical and practical aspects of kinesiology taping.
Kinesiology for occupational therapy
Mabel Elsworth Todd pioneered ideokinesis in the 1920s. Her book, The Thinking Body, described new ways to use all the senses as well as inner feeling and imagination to retrain the body to move with ease and balance. The system became an invaluable tool for generations of dancers, actors, and performance artists, thanks largely to one of its most important teachers, Andre Bernard (1924-2003). This book presents an introduction to the practice as well as a lengthy interview with Bernard and two meticulously detailed workshop protocols illustrated with 52 photographs and line drawings.

For students of human movement, kinesiology, dance science, and dancers, this book takes a positive approach to what a dancer can do to dance better through an understanding of anatomy and an analysis of movement which, in turn, will decrease injury rates. It presents anatomy and motion in a dance-specific way that teaches readers to appreciate and take ownership of their bodies.

This new edition will give teachers a clearer picture of the anatomical and kinesiological factors that aid in generating technique cues and identifying technique problems. It will provide dancers with a better understanding of overcoming technique challenges and preventing injuries. Its solid grounding in the sciences, along with the art and accessible text, will help teachers become more effective and empower dancers to realize their potential and artistic vision. Textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in anatomy, kinesiology, technique, conditioning, or injury prevention. Reference for dance science professionals, dance instructors, dancers, Pilates instructors, and Pilates enthusiasts.

Bringing together the traditions of creative dance and current educational theory, Creative Dance and Learning gives teachers the means to make movement expression a part of students' lives. By helping them develop their kinesthetic intelligence, the text shows teachers how to tap into this rich modality of learning and integrate it into the many goals of education, including self-awareness, creativity, fitness, and individual and group problem-solving skills. Extensive lesson plan applications demonstrate how movement activities can be linked to academic subjects such as language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. More than 25 lesson plans and 40 lesson adaptations are included so that lessons can be adapted to a wide range of age groups and settings. Creative Toolboxes offer specific activities to try with students and Concept Spotlights encapsulate lesson concepts. Lesson Worksheets and Brainstorming Lists illustrate the lesson-planning process, while chapter summaries and review questions round out this helpful resource.
