The Earth is severely suffering from greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Many countries have been working in alliance on mitigating and improving this situation by establishing and joining organisations that cope with drastic climate change. There are several methodologies being adopted and applied for countries depending on their suitability to reduce greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide it concerns.  Clean Development Mechanism is one of methodologies being widely in use in Central and South Asia, Africa and South America. The aim of the thesis is to analyse current situation of global carbon markets and of application of Clean Development Mechanism in Central Asia and Republic of Kazakhstan minutely and test its usability, suitability and furthermore feasibility by analysing reliable collected data from environmental research organisations and firms in Kazakhstan and also interviewing construction consultant regarding Kazakhstan's economical and technological development level. Republic of Kazakhstan, fast growing country in the world with abundant natural resources and indefinite potentials of development in the future, yet, however, has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, it has become one of countries emitting GHG the most in the world within short period. Despite environmentally unfriendly legal frame and timeworn inefficient power plants and factories from Soviet period, Kazakhstan has been trying hard to develop their national environmental status by establishing a number of CDM projects. According to financial estimation, minimum $70,000 for a small scale project and $300,000 for a large scale project are requested to operate and manage it successfully. It may seem slightly difficult now since they have to arrange financial support mainly by themselves but once they ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is being expected in any minute, it will help their situation in financial aspect since they would be eligible to get supports from not only international organisations but also investors interested in projects held in Kazakhstan.
