Effect of growth media on germination and seedling growth of Persea americana (Mill.)
Temperate and subtropical fruit production
Persea americana seeds and seedling performance under various growth media were investigated. The study was carried out at the Teaching and Research Farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Delta State University. Four growth media (top soil, sawdust, sharp sand and clay soil) were used. The treatments were replicated three times in a completely randomized design experiment. The results showed that there were significant differences in plant height, collar diameter, leaf number and leaf area. The highest plant height of 15.81 cm was recorded under top soil which was closely followed by 13.42 cm for saw dust, while 13.18 cm and 12.01 cm height values were recorded for sharp sand and clay soil respectively. It is recommended that local farmers should utilize good top soil for the establishment of this species with a view to preventing them from going into extinction.
