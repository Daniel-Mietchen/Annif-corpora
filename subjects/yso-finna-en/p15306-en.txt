The aim of Master's thesis was to find out the basic elements for successful wastewater treatment. The main focus is on the efficiency of phosphorus removal from wastewater at wood containing paper mills and on the methods to boost phosphorus removal, either chemically or biologically. It was found that the key parameters in chemical precipitation of phosphorus are the effective mixing of precipitation agent in water, the pH, phosphorus concentration and the temperature of wastewater. By controlling these parameters, effective phosphorus reduction in water can be ensured. The biological phosphorus removal was found to be based on aerobic conditions, where the poly-P bacteria collect orthophosphates inside the cell to form polyphosphates. Consequently, the phosphate concentration of liquid decreases in  effluent. Many issues of biological treatment were found to be in relation with the unfavorable conditions in microbiological growth. They are seen in the ineffectiveness of nutrient utilization or in the poor sedimentation properties of the sludge. Correction of the the problems should be started by ensuring essential factors for bacterial growth such as the availability of substrate concentration (BOD), nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, oxygen, the temperature and toxicity of wastewater. The survey made for European SC paper mills showed that wastewater treatment is based on the activated sludge recycling process in the majority of the mills. The COD reduction was seen as the most significant challenge in their current wastewater treatment.

"This book effectively combines the chemical, physical, biological and engineering principles of water disinfection in one text. Discussing both conventional and novel techniques used for disinfection and the economics involved, the book gives a comprehensive review of various physical, chemical, and hybrid techniques used for disinfection to create potable water, including mode of action, scale of operation, efficacy, merits, and drawbacks. The authors highlight their novel work on cavitation for water disinfection, an economical, energy efficient, and simple alternative to the conventional methods of disinfection"--

Electrocoagulation (EC) is an emerging technology that combines the functions and advantages of conventional coagulation, flotation, and electrochemistry in water and wastewater treatment. The aims of this work included doing an updated literary review of recent feasible applications of EC, which were found to be plentiful. Since the economic and practical operational key figures related to EC haven’t been extensively mapped out before, this was a prime objective of this part of the work.The aim of the next part of this work was to find new feasible applications for EC in the treatment of water and wastewater. The studied wastewaters included bio- and synthetic oil-in-water emulsions, various industrial nutrient-containing wastewaters, and peat bog drainage water containing humic substances (an interesting and topical problem, especially in Finland). These studies proved the feasibility of EC. In addition, larger-scale experiments were also conducted successfully, thus proving the scalability of the EC process. Extensive economic analyses of the studied EC applications were also done. The operational costs and energy consumption of EC were found to be very low—typically about 0.1–1.0 €/m3 and 0.4–4.0 kWh/m3.It has been forecasted that in the future there will be a shortage of virgin phosphorus. Therefore, another essential purpose of this work was to conduct a preliminary study on the feasibility of using EC for nutrient (especially phosphorus, but also nitrogen) removal and recovery from different types of real wastewater. Specifically, it may be possible to use EC sludges containing notable amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen as additives in granulated bio ash-based fertilizer products for various applications. This is a novel idea and a “hot topic” in the waste utilization sector and in circular and bioeconomy.^

Skimmers are known to be one of the most efficient tool that are normally employed in effective oil clean-up and recovery operation as well as during treatment of waste water before a final discharge into the environment.  There are lots of factors that determine the recovery rates of most skimmers especially when certain oil types are involved. In this piece, I will be writing about the use of skimmers, how it works, how the specification and design of skimmers enhances its oil recovery abilities and its general advantage over host of other equipments. My source of writing will be solely based on scientific journals, textbooks, articles and internet sources which deal indepthly with the topic in question.

Wastewater treatment
Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.
