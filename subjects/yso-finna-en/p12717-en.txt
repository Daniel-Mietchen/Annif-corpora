Interpreting Difficult History at Museums and Historic Sites is framed by educational psychoanalytic theory and positions museum workers, public historians, and museum visitors as learners. Through this lens, museum workers and public historians can develop compelling and ethical representations of historical individuals, communities, and populations who have suffered.

The central doctrine of empiricism - that true knowledge or understanding of the world comes ultimately from sense impressions - has underpinned most of the practices and arguments of historians for the past 150 years. Empirical history has always faced attacks from a variety of other approaches, however, including Marxism, philosophical idealism and, most recently, postmodernism. In spite of this, empirical methods have prevailed, and the study of history remains broadly empirical. In this concise introductory guide, Stephen Davies: - explains what historians mean by empiricism - examines the origins and growth of the empirical method and how it has fought off challenges from other ways of studying the past - assesses its application to an ever wider range of subjects - shows how students can apply empirical methods to their own work.

In defence of history
This book describes the attempt in post-Communist Hungary to distort and denigrate the Holocaust, often by respectable public figures such as intellectuals, members of parliament, and influential government and party leaders. Such figures appeared resolved to explain and justify Hungary's linkage to Nazi Germany, rehabilitate the Horthy regime, and absolve the country of any responsibility for the deaths of approximately 550,000 of its Jewish citizens.

"Documentaries have recently become a favourite format for Chinese state-directed media to present an officially sanctioned view of history. Indeed, this is not confined to Chinese national history. In stark contrast to the earlier self-centred preoccupation with Chinese history, there has been an upsurge in interest in foreign history, with a view to illuminating China's role not only in world history, but also on the global stage today, and in the future. This book examines three recent Chinese documentary television series which present the officially sanctioned view of the rise of the modern West, the reasons for the end of the Soviet Union, and the legitimisation of the present-day Chinese government via a specific reading of modern Chinese history to argue for a "Chinese rise" in the future. With a focus on these documentaries, Gotelind Müller discusses how history is presented on screen, and explores the function of visual history for memory culture and wider society. Further, this book reveals how the presentation of Chinese and foreign history in a global framework impacts on the officially transmitted views on Self and Other, and thus provides a keen insight into how the Chinese themselves regard their "global rise". Documentary, World History, and National Power in the PRC will be welcomed by students and scholars working across a number of fields, including Chinese studies, East Asian studies, media studies, television studies, history and memory studies.

'Beyond the Canon' deals with recent politicized processes of canonization and its implications for historical culture in a globalizing and postcolonial world. The volume discusses the framing and transmission of historical knowledge and its consequences for the construction of narratives and the teaching of history in multicultural environments. Governments throughout the Western world are increasingly concerned about national identity and the transmission of historical knowledge. Beyond the Canon tackles these issues and their possible effects for historical culture in a globalizing and postcolonial world. The editors have tied the various contributions together in a fascinating and highly relevant volume about the philosophical grounding of (de-)canonization processes and its consequences for the construction of narratives and the teaching of history in multicultural class rooms and museums. The authors reconfigure the different historical narratives and moral perspectives generated in the sometimes difficult processes of coming to terms with the pasts of Germany, South Africa and postcolonial Western nations. What happens when foundational concepts, such as the Enlightenment, the nation or gender, are subjected to critique and revision? Introducing English-speaking readers to important international scholars whose previous work has been in other languages, this volume is a valuable contribution to studies in International History.

"Game Studies is a rapidly growing area of contemporary scholarship, yet volumes in the area have tended to focus on more general issues. With Playing with the Past, game studies is taken to the next level by offering a specific and detailed analysis of one area of digital game play -- the representation of history. The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--
