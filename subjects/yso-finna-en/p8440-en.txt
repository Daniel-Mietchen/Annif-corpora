During the thesis project, a web browser based application was designed, implemented and tested as an assignment of Finnish software company Innofactor Ltd. The result of the thesis is an information system, which is used by Innofactor ltd to enhance the customer services process. The implementation and planning includes efficient usage of existing controls and classes of the Innofactor Prime Platform and therefore minimizing the unnecessary repetition of source code. The main techniques used to implement the application are .NET Framework, ASP.NET AND Microsoft SQL Server. The application follows the n-tier structure of Innofactor Prime Platform. The source material used in the thesis project was Innofactor's technical documentation. The result of the thesis along with the fully functional customer service's information system is the project documentation and the final report. The information system was successfully taken into use at Innofactor intranet at September 2008. After the testing was completed, it was determined that the new information system fulfils the set demands and it provides a good platform to develop the system further.

Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You'll learn how to: Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, CSP, and CORS Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, "Security Engineering Cheat Sheets' at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you're most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications to stand the test of time"--.
