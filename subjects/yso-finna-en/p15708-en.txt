"Exploring questions of how and why the quality of a person's voice influences our perceptions, Foundations of Voice Studies provides a comprehensive introduction to, and analysis of, the multifaceted role that voice quality plays in our social lives. Beginning with an approachable and thorough overview of various aspects of vocal physiology and its control, Kreiman and Sidtis examine the neurological and sociological contexts for producing and listening to voices. Replete with fascinating sidebars and discussions of how voices are used in advertising and media, and legal and forensic issues of identifying voices, they have written an essential work that unifies the results of their own pioneering studies with the most current scientific literature. This unique and interdisciplinary volume on all facets of voice production and its perception is supported by sound files and additional material, available at www.wiley.com/go/voicestudies"--
"This book aims to convey to engineering students and researchers alike the relevant knowledge about the nature of acoustics, sound and hearing that will enable them to develop new technologies in this area through acquiring a thorough understanding of how sound and hearing works. There is currently no technical book available covering the communication path from sound sources through medium to the formation of auditory events in the brain - this book will fill this gap in the current book literature. It discusses the multidisciplinary area of acoustics, hearing, psychoacoustics, signal processing, speech and sound quality and is suitable for use as a main course textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate courses related to audio communication systems. It covers the basics of signal processing, traditional acoustics as well as the human hearing system and how to build audio techniques based on human hearing resolution. It discusses the technologies and applications for sound synthesis and reproduction, and for speech and audio quality evaluation"--
