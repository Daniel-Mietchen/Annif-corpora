Multi-moment asset allocation and pricing models
The integrated solutions for Bodie, Kane, and Marcus' Investments set the standard for graduate/MBA investments textbooks. The unifying theme is that security markets are nearly efficient, meaning that most securities are priced appropriately given their risk and return attributes. The content places greater emphasis on asset allocation and offers a much broader and deeper treatment of futures, options, and other derivative security markets than most investment texts. McGraw-Hill's adaptive learning component, LearnSmart, provides assignable modules that help students master chapter core concepts and come to class more prepared. In addition, resources within Connect Plus help students solve financial problems and apply what they've learned. Bodie Investments' blend of practical and theoretical coverage combines with a complete digital solution to help your students achieve higher outcomes in the course.

The four pillars of investing : lessons for building a winning portfolio
"High-Performance Managed Futures is the first book to show how to design investment portfolios to be independent of the stock market or economy using an unknown investment, managed futures, the most non-correlated asset class in the history of investing. Author Mark Melin illustrates how to develop a diversified portfolio split among non-correlated asset classes. Judging by the major indices, this little known method significantly outperformed traditional stock and bond investments over the past thirty years. While managed futures has significantly outperformed the stock market for over thirty years, the investment method was generally ignored by Wall Street financial advisors and hidden from individual investors. For the first time a book will show exactly how to develop stock market neutral investment portfolios. In this book, a Nobel Prize winning investment method is advanced, updated for modern times with stunning clarity and compelling prose to illuminate a new path for managing investments so as not to be entirely dependent on the economy at large"--
Portfolio Composition of Individual Investors in Finland
Frontier markets account for 15 percent of global GDP, yet global investors largely ignore them. Fueled by access to technology and information, these markets are emerging even faster than their predecessors, making them an essential component of a globally diversified portfolio. In Frontier Investor, Marko Dimitrijevic makes the case for their inclusion, arguing&#x0097;through a diverse set of case studies&#x0097;that it is possible if not wise to make informed investing decisions about these unfamiliar and undervalued markets. Markets that were considered exotic two decades ago&#x0097;China, India, South Africa, and Russia&#x0097;are today's mainstream. Dimitrijevic begins with an analysis of how this came to be and looks at the markets that are poised to follow a similar path. He then details a strategy for how and where to invest directly or indirectly for those with limited access but who still wish to profit from emerging market growth. Dimitrijevic covers the political and other risks of taking advantage of these opportunities and the megatrends that may provide new options and open up new countries, such as Cuba and Iran, to exponential growth.
