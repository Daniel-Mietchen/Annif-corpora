Intra-plant variation for progress of cell division in developing oat grains : a preliminary study
As part of a multi-year monitoring study of pollination dynamics in a second generation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seed orchard, we estimated with the aid of eight microsatellite markers three important reproductive biology characteristics affecting the genetic worth and diversity of seed crops; namely parental reproductive success, pollen contamination, and selfing rate. The obtained results were compared to those from two previous years to gauge appropriate seed crop management practices and ultimately allow approximate generalization of seed crop genetic quality. We determined that 80% of parental gametes were produced by 52% of the parents, 13% of paternal gametes resulted from pollen contamination (i.e., gene flow), and 12% of the seed were the product of selfing. The obtained results were in line with those observed for 2005 and 2009 where 80% of gametes being produced by 37-48% of the parents, 10-18% pollen contamination, and 15-17% selfing rate. The observed reproductive biology parameters differences are attributable to the various crop management practices implemented (i.e., bloom delay and supplemental-mass-pollination) across years and calls for justification due to the observed minimal differences on seed crops genetic quality..

Pollination and breeding of eggplants
Summary: Insects visiting cloudberry flowers were studied in three areas north of the Arctic Circle: Forests and Fell Lapland in Finland, and Finnmark in Norway...
Summary: The study is based on counts and analyses of the pollen carried by insect visitors to the female flowers of cloudberry in Finnish Forest and Fell Lapland, and at Varangerbotn and Ekkeröya in Norwegian Finnmark. The best pollen-carriers were species of Apidae and Formicidae of Hymenoptera, and of Syrphidae, Muscidae...
