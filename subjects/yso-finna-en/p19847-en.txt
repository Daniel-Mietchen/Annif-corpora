The objective of the thesis was to determinate how development discussions should be implemented at HAMK in the Degree Programme in International Business so that they would benefit the student and the organization.   The two issues which are in conflict in the development discussion process at universities of applied sciences are the resources and the benefits of the process. The process has been found useful and recommended in business life but in order to implement it, resources must be set. The challenge of the thesis is on the one hand to prove exactly how useful the development discussion process is and why the resources should be sacrificed.   The theory of the development discussion process is gathered from different sources, but mostly from business life as there is little theory to be found written about development discussions in higher education. The business life theory as well as the questionnaires and interviews conducted for this study do support the practical suggestions created for the Degree Programme in International Business. As an end result the thesis provides HAMK practical improvements and suggestions for implementing development discussions for students.
