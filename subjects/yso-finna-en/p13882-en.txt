This book offers a guide to: achieve business benefits while building lasting BPM capabilities: and put the right team and infrastructure in place to build an organization designed for an outcome and value-based BPM capability.
At the global level, organizations have wasted much time over-focusing on the unattainable (objectivity in appraisals) and ignoring the more critical (continuous improvements in individual, dyadic, and team performance) goals. This thoroughly revised second edition shifts the entire focus of performance management to performance improvement and talent management. This book will also help in enhancing the performance of individuals, dyads, and teams for achieving organizational excellence.
The three laws of performance : rewriting the future of your organization and your life
HRM and performance : achievements and challenges
This is a book that does what the title says, and is different from most business process mapping information in three key ways. First, it lets users capture all the knowledge that goes into a workflow in any kind of organization, including the most difficult kind of all, the tacit knowledge people bring to the job and carry in their heads. Second, it is simple, powerful, flexible, and easy to learn. Third, it does not require installing, learning, and applying a complicated program (sometimes requiring reorganization to support the software rather than the software supporting the organization). It was developed by the author in a fifteen-year long program of studying, analyzing, and improving avionics maintenance processes for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force, and then applied to organizations of all kinds ever since, for more than two decades. It has been taught and applied by the author and others in many short courses. It works.

Balanced Scorecard
"A thorough and comprehensive guide to measuring and managing the performance of businesses, understanding where you are, communicating where you want to be and managing towards your longer term strategic goals. Measuring performance in a way which is linked to strategy and measures the right activities is a process which few organizations undertake, but those which do reap substantial benefits in terms of increased success. Even fewer organizations can maintain and use their measurement system effectively, engaging the workforce in delivering success. This book will show readers how to do just that, using relevant examples from a variety of organizations including: Tesco's 'steering wheel'- a means of displaying what is important to the organization from boardroom to store - Terry Leahy has attributed much of Tesco's success to their performance management approach EDF Energy's highly innovative approach to cascading their 'success maps' down the organization, winning them a high degree of ownership and commitment to the organizational goals by involving people at all levels in the process Taking a practical approach, and including details of processes and tools that can be adopted and customized by any organization, the authors also include guiding principles to help readers avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate performance management. The book, uniquely, combines guidance on the practical use of frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, with the application of measures to manage performance"--
