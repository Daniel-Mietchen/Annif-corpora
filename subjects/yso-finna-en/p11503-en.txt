Stress responses in plants : adaptation and acclimation mechanisms
Changes in climate will impose abiotic stress on plant species, and eventually affect their distributional range. This is a particular challenge especially to tree species with long generation times and slow rates of evolution. In the boreal zone, most of these species also hold high economic value. The aim of the study was to enhance understanding of the abiotic stress coping strategies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in its vulnerable early growth phase. In particular, the study evaluates the role of polyamine (PA) metabolism of Scots pine under abiotic stress. Polyamines (PAs) are small, ubiquitous nitrogenous compounds involved in fundamental biological processes of plants such as growth, organogenesis, embryogenesis and abiotic and biotic stress defence.The effects of different water availabilities and spring frost temperatures on shoots and roots of young seedlings were investigated in two growth chamber experiments. Proembryogenic liquid cell culture system was established and used as a controllable platform. Effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced osmotic stress was investigated at the cellular level in liquid cultures. Responses to treatments were evaluated by quantifying changes in the expression of PA metabolism, stress, cell death and cell division -related genes, metabolite concentrations, as well as stress-induced physiology and morphology.The results revealed that PA metabolism is tissue specific and strictly regulated. Drought stress induced the accumulation of putrescine (Put) in photosynthesizing tissues, whereas the prime response to spring frost was a reorganization of root growth. Generally, drought and osmotic stress decreased the expression of PA catabolizing genes, leading to consistent PA levels in tissues even under severe stress. To conclude, PAs have a protective role in maintaining the growth and development of pine tissues subje cted to abiotic stress.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of anomalies in affected children due to maternal alcohol administration at vulnerable stages of fetal development. Intrauterine growth restriction and facial malformation are the presenting phenotypes of FAS.In this investigation, novel pathomechanisms of intrauterine growth restriction and facial malformation were the primary aims.We found by a FAS mouse model that AceCS1 gene expression and polyamines are the immediate targets of fetal alcohol exposure. The AceCS1 product is a precursor for lipid synthesis and protein acetylation and possibly, for polycation acetylation. We cloned the Mus musculus nuclear-cytosolic AceCS1 gene, and showed that its expression is developmentally regulated with a dynamic localization in the cytosolic and nuclear compartment. The enzyme plays an essential role in de novo synthesis of acetyl Coenzyme A.Fetal alcohol administration targets nutrient supplying networks, which are localized at critical barriers. The main findings were reduced surface of the labyrinthine zone, destruction of gap junctions in the hemotrichorial placenta, reduced syncytiotrophoblastic cell layers and loosening of interaction between cell layers and embryo endothelial cells, reduced Reichert's membrane thickness with discontinued Reichert's trophoblast and loss of interaction by Reichert's-parietal cells, reduction of capillary network and reduced vascularization in the brain area, and perturbed neural crest migration and formation of neural tube defect. Alteration of angiogenesis -regulating proteins such as VEGF, PlGF, PECAM was detected in FAS, with no significant changes in placental angiogenesis of the labyrinthine zone, but up-regulation of VEGF/PlGF caused permeability changes in the placenta and yolk sac. On the other hand, the PECAM pool in embryos' brain was reduced, which in turn led to decreased angiogenesisand vascularization.

Summary.
Should the frequency of drought increase in boreal forests due to climate change, seedlings planted in prepared peat mounds could become more susceptible to soil desiccation. The resistance of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings to drought will thus be a key factor in the regeneration success of pine-dominated, forestry-drained peatlands. In this study, we evaluated the physiological, metabolic, and morphologiÂ¬cal responses of year-old seedlings gradually exposed to extreme drought in highly decomposed Sphagnum-Carex peat blocks. Drought clearly suppressed root and shoot growth as well as fractional colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Sustained declines in photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of previous-year and current-year needles did not occur until the volumetric soil water content had dropped to 30% and 10%, respectively. Polyamine analysis revealed that new needles are preferred in protecting the different parts of the seedlings against drought stress. Despite growth losses, the maintenance of rather high photochemical efficiency in current-year needles under severe water stress would appear to indicate a potential for seedling recovery if water availability in the peat improved. Given the high tolerance exhibited by Scots pine seedlings, death by drought seems a lesser concern.
