Customization is crucial in the extremely competitive field of electronical devices. Customers have learned more means to gain information about products and services available and know how to demand more value. Changes in sales package content employ many different departments in companies. The information and material flow through borders of those departments is the key issue in creating a mechanical variation requested by a customer. Long lead times have inflicted in variation creation in sales channels and this results as loss of both work and income for the company. The aim of this thesis is to renew and enhance a mechanical combo process through creating more understandable process flow chart combined with detailed guidance for roles involved. The negative feedback from customers have dealt with long lead times, in many cases all due to disorganized process and had wrong ownerships. The project with the process renewal was done side by side with an actual mechanical combo process, thus making this a practice-based study.  Different contact persons were interviewed to gain understanding on their roles and to see where the major problems lied. The final results, e.e. the renewed process flow charts were sent to different customers and the whole process is now seen more feasible. There will still be combos created in customer channels but now the roles and resources are clearer and the lead times in mechanical combo creation have been made shorter.
