"Offers a cogent overview of the historical context and enduring patterns of U.S. relations with Asia ... Robert G. Sutter provides a balanced analysis of post-Cold War dynamics in Asia, which involve interrelated questions of security, economics, national identity, and regional institution building. He demonstrates how these critical concerns manifest a complex mix of realist, liberal, and constructivist tendencies that define the regional order. Sutter weighs how the recent US emphasis on "re-engagement" with the broader Asia-Pacific fits within the context of regional dynamics. He assesses how the United States has responded to Asia's growing strength and importance while at the same time trying to maintain its leading position as an Asian power despite China's rising influence"--

"The Origins of American Hegemony in Europe Originally published in Italian in 1980, Gli Stati Uniti e il fascismo: Alle origini dell'egemonia Americana in Italia is regarded today as a crucial text on the relationship between the United States and Italy during the interwar years. Aside from the addition of two new prefaces - one by the author and one by the book's translator, Molly Tambor - the original text has remained unchanged, so that Anglophone readers now have the opportunity to engage with this classic work. By analyzing the enduring relationship between the United States - especially its financial establishment - and fascist Italy up until Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia in 1935, this book provides answers to some key questions about the interconnectedness of America's rise to hegemonic global financial power in the twentieth century and its support of Italian fascism during this time. Gian Giacomo Migone is Professor of History of Euroatlantic Relations at the University of Torino, Italy. He is the author of Problemi di Storia nei Rapporti tra Italia e Stati Uniti (1971) and Banchieri Americani e Mussolini (1979), and he has written numerous essays concerning Euro-Atlantic relations before, during, and after the Cold War. He was a member of the Italian Senate, where he chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, the United Nations System Staff College Advisory Board, the Civilian Affairs Committee, and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, from 1992 to 2001. He is the founder and first editor of L'indice dei Libri del Mese, an Italian cultural monthly. Molly Tambor is Assistant Professor of European History at Long Island University Post. She is the author of The Lost Wave: Women and Democracy in Postwar Italy (2014)"--

The rise of modern diplomacy 1450-1919
Modern diplomacy is all too often seen simply as the existence of a country's embassies throughout the world, serving merely to aid expatriates in distress and to facilitate communication and cultural exchange between nations. This book explores not just the development of the international embassy system, but also seeks to trace the rise and progression of diplomacy - and what it has entailed - from the sixteenth century onwards. In "A History of Diplomacy", historian Jeremy Black investigates how a form of courtly negotiation and information-gathering in the early modern period developed through increasing globalization into a world-shaping force in twenty-first-century politics. The monarchic systems of the sixteenth century are seen to have progressed into the increasingly colonial concerns of European nations, which in turn were shaken by the revolutionary turbulence of the eighteenth century. Concluding with the ideological diplomatic conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Black charts the course and evolution of 'diplomacy' in all of its incarnations. The role of modern international Non-Governmental Organizations in diplomatic relations is assessed, and the challenges facing diplomacy in the future are identified and investigated. "A History of Diplomacy" presents a detailed and engaging study into the ever-changing phenomenon of diplomacy: its aims, its achievements, its successes and failures, against a historical and cultural background. An essential read for students and scholars of history and politics, it will also be of interest to anyone intrigued by the forces that have shaped international relations throughout history.
