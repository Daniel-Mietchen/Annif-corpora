"Cellular and Molecular Control of Neuronal Migration provides an up-to-date collection of reviews on the molecular and cellular principles of neuronal migration in the mammalian brain. Over the last decades a rich catalogue of signaling molecules controlling neuronal migration has been compiled, and within this book an international panel of experts provides up-to-date discussions of the state of knowledge how these distinct signaling pathways regulate various aspects of neuronal migration. This book introduces the reader to the latest discoveries and concepts of neuronal migration enabled through the application of most sophisticated methods and cutting edge experimental approaches. Cellular and Molecular Control of Neuronal Migration also provides an update on the underlying cellular and molecular basis of neurodevelopmental migration disorders in human patients for all interested neuroscientists and clinicians." -- (Back Cover)

"Neurosurgery Tricks of the Trade: Cranial presents core surgical procedures in a concise, highly didactic format, enabling surgeons to quickly grasp their essence from the bulleted text and superb illustrations that accompany them. Expert neurosurgeons specializing in the cranial region describe how they perform common procedures and offer surgical tips and pearls. Key Features: - Distills a wealth of information in a concise, step-by-step format, making it easy for novice surgeons to review how procedures are performed - Includes more than 150 surgical procedures for the cranial region, each accompanied by high-quality, original illustrations - Presents topics in either a pathology-based or an approach-based manner - Consistently organizes the procedures into the headings: Introduction and Background, Operative Detail and Preparation, Outcomes and Postoperative Course, and References, enabling rapid reference. Neurosurgeons at all levels, from residents learning procedures to experienced practitioners needing a quick refresher, will find this book, along with its companion volume, Neurosurgery Tricks of the Trade: Spine and Peripheral Nerves, to be an invaluable resource throughout their surgical careers"--Provided by publisher.

"Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain surveys the organization and function of the human nervous system. We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology. The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part II, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part III, The Brain and Behavior; and Part IV, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part II, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part III, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part IV, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher.
