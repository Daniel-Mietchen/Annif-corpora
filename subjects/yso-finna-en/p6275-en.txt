justice
"The Routledge Companion to Literature and Human Rights provides a comprehensive, transnational, and interdisciplinary map to this emerging field, offering a broad overview of human rights and literature while providing innovative readings on key topics. The first of its kind, this volume covers essential issues and themes, necessarily crossing disciplines between the social sciences and humanities. Sections cover: - subjects, with pieces on subjectivity, humanity, identity, gender, universality, the particular, the body; - forms, visiting the different ways human rights stories are crafted and formed via the literary, the visual, the performative, and the oral; - contexts, tracing the development of the literature over time and in relation to specific regions and historical events; - impacts, considering the power and limits of human rights literature, rhetoric, and visual culture. Drawn from many different global contexts, the essays offer an ideal introduction for those approaching the study of literature and human rights for the first time, looking for new insights and interdisciplinary perspectives, or interested in new directions for future scholarship" --

Who has access, and who is denied access, to food, and why? What are the consequences of food insecurity? What would it take for the food system to be just? Just Food: Philosophy, Justice and Food presents thirteen new philosophical essays that explore the causes and consequences of the inequities of our contemporary food system. It examines why 842 million people globally are unable to meet their dietary needs, and why food insecurity is not simply a matter of insufficient supply. The book looks at how food insecurity tracks other social injustices, covering topics such as race, gender and property, as well as food sovereignty, food deserts, and locavorism. The essays in this volume make an important and timely contribution to the wider philosophical debate around food distribution and justice.

"This book explores the concept of 'occupation' in disability well beyond traditional clinical formulations of disability: it considers disability not in terms of pathology or impairment, but as a range of unique social identities and experiences that are shaped by visible or invisible diagnoses/impairments, socio-cultural perceptions and environmental barriers and offers innovative ideas on how to apply theoretical training to real world contexts. Inspired by disability justice and 'Disability Occupy Wall Street / Decolonize Disability' movements in the US and related movements abroad, this book builds on politically engaged critical approaches to disability that intersect occupational therapy, disability studies and anthropology. 'Occupying Disability' will provide a discursive space where the concepts of disability, culture and occupation meet critical theory, activism and the creative arts. The concept of 'occupation' is intentionally a moving target in this book. Some chapters discuss occupying spaces as a form of protest or alternatively, protesting against territorial occupations. Others present occupations as framed or problematized within the fields of occupational therapy and occupational science and anthropology as engagement in meaningful activities. The contributing authors come from a variety of professional, academic and activist backgrounds to include perspectives from theory, practice and experiences of disability. Emergent themes include: all the permutations of the concept of 'occupy,' disability justice/decolonization, marginalization and minoritization, technology, struggle, creativity and change. This book will engage clinicians, social scientists, activists and artists in dialogues about disability as a theoretical construct and lived experience"--Provided by publisher.

This book is addressed to all people of good will who are concerned about what happens to the poor in our Asian societies. Christian Hope is not a self centred hope-it is a hope for the world, for the whole of human family. Christians may find in this volume a help to critically reflect on our societies and above all relate their life and faith with the drams and hopes of the powerless. The book is also intended to help the Christians forge new relationships with the larger society, and in the process, become self-critical. People of good will and believers of other religious traditions may find in this book the struggles Christianity is undergoing in practicing the concern and love its Founder showed towards the poor and the oppressed in the society.
An ontology for social reality
The other's war : recognition and the violence of ethics
This book analyzes in detail differing interpretations of the rule of law in Western legal systems and in the Peoples Republic of China. As the rule of law is seen by many as a prerequisite for Chinas future development, politicians, activists and entrepreneurs from China and from the West alike have long been calling for adherence to this principle, which is constitutive of Western democracies. All these groups use the same words, but do they truly share the same idea? In order to address this question, the book compares the Rule of Law with Chinese characteristics, as propagated by Chinese leaders and in official Chinese publications, to different applications of the rule of law as it is understood in Western civilization. In particular, the author takes a closer look at the implementations of recognized core elements of the rule of law in representative Western countries, which include the separation of power, the supremacy of law, the protection of fundamental rights, and the independence of the justice system.

Stories from the Street is a theological exploration of interviews with men and women who had experienced homelessness at some stage in their lives. Framed within a theology of story and a theology of liberation, Nixon suggests that story is not only a vehicle for creating human transformation but it is one of God's chosen means of effecting change. Short biographies of twelve characters are examined under themes including: crises in health and relationships, self-harm and suicide, anger and pain, God and the Bible. Expanding the existing literature of contextual theology, this book provides an alternative focus to a church-shaped mission by advocating with, and for, a very marginal group; suggesting that their experiences have much to teach the church. Churches are perceived as being active in terms of pastoral work, but reluctant to ask more profound questions about why homelessness exists at all. A theology of homelessness suggests not just a God of the homeless, but a homeless God, who shares stories and provides hope. Engaging with contemporary political and cultural debates about poverty, housing and public spending, Nixon presents a unique theological exploration of homeless people, suffering, hope and the human condition.
