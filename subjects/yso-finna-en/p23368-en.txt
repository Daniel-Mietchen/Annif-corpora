The economic theory of the working class
The relationship of social structure to individual and collective agency has been central to sociology from the outset. It remains so in period in which poststructuralists have challenged the idea of stable social structures and even the usefulness in social science of the concept of structure itself. The historical trajectory of the debate about the respective importance of structure and agency and the relationship between the two provides the narrative context of this collection of articles. The point of arranging this collection of articles predominantly in historical sequence is not simply a matter of convenience. Historical context has a major impact on forming the concerns of sociologists and, equally significantly, on the way they perceive and theorise the social world. It includes: Volume One: Modernity, Sociology and the Structure/Agency Debate ; Volume Two: Postmodernity - An End to the Structure /Agency Dichotomy? ; Volume Three: Structure/Agency Theories Applied ; and, Volume Four: Network Theory - Transcending the Traditional Limits of Structure/Agency .

9.5 theses on art and class
This volume presents a comprehensive analysis of the linkages between inequality, development, and growth from a feminist economics perspective. More specifically, it examines connections between intergroup inequality and macroeconomic outcomes, considering various channels through which gender, growth, and development interact. Using a range of analytical methods, country studies, and levels of aggregation, the contributors argue that inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and class undermine the ability of people to provision and live fully to their capabilities. Authors examine the effect of macroeconomic policies and economic growth on inequalities in material resources and well-being, as well as the effects of inequality on economic growth. The volume offers specific explanations for how the macroeconomy can hinder the achievement of gender equality and in turn how gender relations in areas like education and wage gaps can have macro-level impacts. Finally, the volume offers a rich array of policy options for promoting gender equality as both an intrinsic goal and a step toward improving well-being and broadly-shared development. This book was published as a special issue of Feminist Economics.

Class and stratification analysis
In recent years, the concept of class has come under increasing scrutiny, as a means of explaining both the present and the past. The post-industrial class has superceded the manual working class, and new forms of industrial management have broken up more traditional hierarchies and outlooks. Furthermore, feminism has now brought into question the whole concept of a class identity. Can class viably explain the present? Did it ever provide an adequate explanation of the past? How did concepts of class develop? What is the language of class? A variety of writings are drawn upon here to suggest answers to these questions, to provide a balanced survey of thought on class, from Marx and Weber to the present day, and to look beyond this towards the very future of class.
The multiparadigmatic trend in sociology
"9.5 Theses on Art and Class and Other Writings seeks to show how a clear understanding of class makes sense of what is at stake in a broad number of contemporary art's most persistent debates, from definitions of political art to the troubled status of "outsider" and street art to the question of how we maintain faith in art itself"--
Approaches to class analysis
This book is a meeting ground for mainstream social theory and contemporary feminist theory. The book brings feminist theory face to face with Pierre Bourdieu's social theory; demonstrates how much Bourdieu's theory has to offer to contemporary feminism; comprises a series of contributions from key contemporary feminist thinkers; defines new territories for feminist theorizing; and, transforms and advances Bourdieu's social and cultural theory.
