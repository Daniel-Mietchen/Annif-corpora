The aim of this thesis was to find out how the acquisition process and the transition period went from the point of view of the personnel in the acquired company, and also to create recommendations for future operations. This thesis was carried out as a case study and it includes both qualitative and quantitative data. An Internet link to an anonymous survey was sent to the personnel by e-mail in the end of November when the transition period was officially over. The survey was sent to 15 people of whom 14 answered. The response percentage was 93%.  The survey results reveal that in this acquisition the higher-level reporting regarding general issues was managed well, but more problems occurred as it came closer to daily operations. The general issues regarding the change were well informed during the transition period and the cutover went as smoothly as planned. The core problems consisted of a shortage of resources, the allocation of resources and inadequate training and testing. Internal communication supported the transition period well and the usage of different communication methods was versatile.
