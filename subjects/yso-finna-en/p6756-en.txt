Science educator's guide to laboratory assessment
Since the publication of the sixth edition of this benchmark text, numerous advances in the field have been made - particularly in stem cells, 3D culture, scale-up, STR profiling, and culture of specialized cells. "Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique and Specialized Applications, Seventh Edition" is the updated version of this benchmark text, addressing these recent developments in the field as well as the basic skills and protocols.     This eagerly awaited edition reviews the increasing diversity of the applications of cell culture and the proliferation of specialized techniques, and provides an introduction to new subtopics in mini-reviews. New features also include a new chapter on cell line authentication with a review of the major issues and appropriate protocols including DNA profiling and barcoding, as well as some new specialized protocols. Because of the continuing expansion of cell culture, and to keep the bulk of the book to a reasonable size, some specialized protocols are presented as supplementary material online. "Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique and Specialized Applications, Seventh Edition" provides the most accessible and comprehensive introduction available to the culture and experimental manipulation of animal cells. This text is an indispensable resource for those in or entering the field, including academic research scientists, clinical and biopharmaceutical researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, cell and molecular biology and genetics lab managers, trainees and technicians.

"Forensic Applications of High Performance Liquid Chromatography uses real-life examples likely to be found within a forensic science laboratory to explain HPLC from a forensic perspective." "The book presents key point summaries and questions to enhance learning and test comprehension, provides a complete glossary of terms, and includes references at the end of each chapter to facilitate further study. An invaluable guide for those in the early stages of their forensic analysis careers, this volume is also suitable as a textbook for university students studying analytical chemistry, applied chemistry, forensic chemistry, or other courses with an element of HPLC within the course curriculum."--
