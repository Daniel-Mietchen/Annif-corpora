Literary Knits features 30 knitting patterns inspired by beloved characters from classic books; from Pride and Prejudice to Moby Dick, The Catcher in the Rye to The Chronicles of Narnia—and many more in between. Inspired by some of the most beloved characters from favorite books, including an elegant Daisy Cloche inspired by The Great Gatsby and a late '50s-inspired Holly Golightly Dress imagined from Breakfast at Tiffany's, the more than 30 knitting projects in this unique collection will inspire.
"Compelling Collection: Drawing from the fashion trends of the 40's through the 70's, the patterns will give fans of retro style what they want -- fun, wearable patterns that echo those of days gone by, but that modern knitters can use with greater ease. The designs in the book will represent a balance of classic and kitsch, wardrobe basics and saucy specials. For a bit of extra fun, four craft and sewing patterns between chapters will give readers a way to add retro appeal to their homes and outfits. Appealing design: The book will have a distinctive look that mimics pattern magazines from the past. Colorful photos and styled models will poke lighthearted fun at the looks that date so many of these magazines".

"44 patterns inspired by the '40s, '50s, '60s, and '70s  Knitters love all things vintage-but it's not as easy as picking up an old pattern from decades past. Oftentimes, they use obsolete yarns, aren't sized for today's body shapes, and are written differently than current pattern instructions.  Now, retro-minded crafters get the best of both worlds in this unique collection. Drawing from the fashion trends of the '40s through the '70s, Knitting it Old School offers a bold new twist on vintage-inspired knitting patterns.  Vintage patterns feature newly created designs that flatter today's figure and use contemporary yarns.  Fun, wearable patterns that echo styles of days gone by.  Four bonus sewing patterns to whip up complimentary vintage-themed accessories.  With a balance of classic and kitsch, wardrobe basics and saucy specials, Knitting it Old School is a breath of fresh air for knitters who love "old" but want to be "new.".
Drawing inspiration from the natural beauty of flowers, Kaffe Fassett's Bold Blooms invites crafters to explore the behind-the-scenes process and fascinating design methods used to create Kaffe's bold fabrics and modern colour palettes--from 'sketching' with fabric swatches to creating mood boards and renderings to sewing visually striking quilts. Featured throughout are 18 new quilt patterns and seven new needlepoints.
