Polymer nanocomposites are organic-inorganic hybrid materials where the inorganic filler has at least one dimension in the nanometer scale. They have properties that are far superior to those of not only the parent materials but also conventional microcomposites. These include optical, magnetic, thermal, energy-scavenging, biosensing, gas/water barrier, antimicrobial, and biodegradability properties. Two factors are responsible for these superior properties: the interface between polymer and matrix and the confinement of polymer matrix chains at the nanolevel.

The effect of different paper mulches and two different biodegradable plastic mulches on the yield of field-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was examined. The studies were conducted during two climatically different growing seasons 2011 and 2012 in Southern Finland.  All the mulches increased the yield as compared to bare ground. In 2011, cucumbers on all the mulches with a dark upper surface produced higher yields than those on kraft paper alone. In 2012, when the average temperatures were lower than in 2011, there were no differences in yield between different types of mulches. Soil temperatures of the experimental plots were monitored throughout the growing seasons. The mulches with a dark-colored upper surface increased the soil temperature more than the ones with a light-colored upper surface. The soil warming effect of the mulches was greater during early season and diminished when the plants grew larger and their leaves covered most of the mulch surface. There was no need for weed control except in uncovered plots. In conclusion, during both years dark-colored paper mulch was comparable to biodegradable film in yield production and could replace it as a mulch material in cucumber production.

The aims of this study were to determine the phytotoxicity of stored rapeseed (Brassica rapa) oil (RSO) and rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) after "spill like" contamination on the growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the biodegradability of these substances in OECD 301F test conditions and in ground water. Rapeseed oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester were both stored for a period of time and their fuel characteristics (e.g. acid number) had changed from those set by the fuel standards and are considered to have an effect on its biodegradation. The phytotoxicity was tested using two different types of barley cultivars: "Saana" and "Vilde". The phytotoxic effect on the barley varieties was determined, after the growth season, by measuring the total biomass growth and the mass of 1000 kernels taken from the tests plots. Also visual inspection was used to determine what the effects on the barley growth were. These measurements suggest that both RSO and RME have a negative impact on barley sprouts and therefore the total growth of the barley. RSO and RME both decreased the total amount of harvested phytomass. The weight of 1000 kernels increased with low concentrations of these contaminants and high contamination levels reduced the mass of the kernels. The results of these experiments suggest that the stored rapeseed oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester are both phytotoxic materials and therefore will cause substantial loss of vegetation in the case of a fuel spill. The RSO and RME biodegraded effectively in the measurement period of 28 days under OECD test conditions: the degree of biodegradation being over 60%. The biodegradation in the ground water was much slower: the degree of biodegradation being about 10% after 28 days.
Food biodeterioration and preservation
Highly hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as n-hexane have major impacts on the environment and human health and for this reason their release to the atmosphere should be prevented. This set off the development of various treatment technologies, one of them being biological treatment systems. These systems are known for their cost-effectiveness and their low environmental impact. A disadvantage of these systems when applied to the treatment of hydrophobic VOCs is their poor mass transfer from the gas phase to the aqueous phase. Therefore, the use of a two-phase partitioning bioreactor can function as an effective alternative for hydrophobic VOC treatment. TPPBs are based on the addition of a non-aqueous phase (NAP), either liquid solvent or solid polymer, to overcome the mass transfer limitation. In this study different operational strategies were assessed to find the most feasible strategy in operating a two-phase partitioning bioreactor for the treatment of n-hexane. During 80 days of operation, different experimental operation modes were used including silicone oil addition, addition of a hydrophilic consortium and operation at a medium exchange rate (MER) of 0.5 L day-1. The addition of silicone oil had already a significant increase in elimination capacity (EC). The addition of a hydrophilic consortium was characterized with twice as high EC, but did not last for very long. Eventually when a MER of 0.5 L day-1 was applied a high steady EC was reached. Therefore changing the medium at a rate of 0.5 L dat-1 was the most effective operation mode for keeping a high and stable biodegradation of n-hexane. During this period the EC and removal efficiency (RE) reached values of 21 ±1.5 g m-3 h-1 and 80 ± 5 %, respectively. Therefore, these operational conditions should be considered for potential application of TPPBs at large scales.
