Abstract: This project was carried out for the Public Works Department of Helsinki City, and the purpose was to create a location-aware feedback application for the Android mobile platform. The created application was capable of interacting with a remote server and rendering the user interface at runtime depending upon data retrieved from the database. In addition, a web application was also required to be created to handle the database. The mobile application was developed in the Android platform using the Java programming language in Eclipse IDE. MYSQL was used for database design and PHP was used as a server side scripting language. The web application consisted of simple HTML pages with CSS and Javascript. During the project, a localized Android application, capable of accessing device features such as camera and GPS and creating the user interface dynamically, was developed. The web application was also created, and it acted as an interface for creating, viewing and modifying the data in the database. The developed Android application can be used effectively to get feedback from general citizens in workshops organized by the Public Works Department of Helsinki City in the form of general text, images and location information. As the application is localized, it is accessible to people using the Finnish, Swedish and English language.

In the future, shopping will be greatly influenced by a combination of localization issues, mobile internet at the point of sale, and use of social networks. This book focuses on the ‘SoLoMo synergies’ that arise from this paradigm shift in future shopping, which also promises new and effective marketing options for traditional retailers. It also reflects the current status of research and business practice, analyzing the basic factors of SoLoMo in detail. The importance of Location-based Services (LBS) is elaborated and analyzed in an empirical study using a market based case of kaufDA – a leading German online shopping network. The evidence shows that customers see LBS as an attractive tool and are prepared to change their buying behavior. Though LBS is still in its early stages and its professional longevity remains to be seen, it also promises tremendous potential for the future.

The iPhone represents an important moment in both the short history of mobile media and the long history of cultural technologies. Like the Walkman of the 1980s, it marks a juncture in which notions about identity, individualism, lifestyle and sociality require rearticulation. this book explores not only the iPhone's particular characteristics, uses and "affects," but also how the "iPhone moment" functions as a barometer for broader patterns of change. In the iPhone moment, this study considers the convergent trajectories in the evolution of digital and mobile culture, and their implications for future scholarship. Through the lens of the iPhone--as a symbol, culture and a set of material practices around contemporary convergent mobile media--the essays collected here explore the most productive theoretical and methodological approaches for grasping media practice, consumer culture and networked communication in the twenty-first century.

The Internet of Things is all about machines trading with machines - your fridge orders groceries; your car, fuel; your television, entertainment; and so on. However, machines cannot trade with machines if it's expensive and slow. Would you really want your TV to order the next season of Games of Thrones, if the payment took ten days and cost 25 or more? Unfortunately with the way the bank system works today, that is the problem we face today. As a result, we need an Internet of Value to work with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Value - or ValueWeb, for short - allows machines to trade.

Mobile application as a potential key customer base
The research studies mobile applications as a key customer base and it is done for a Finnish sport retailer, Top-Sport Oy. The study examines if a mobile application could be used as a key customer base. The use of smartphones is in rapid growth and companies are increasingly interested in the use of social media and mobile applications. The commissioner does not have an existing key customer base. Technical issues are not discussed in this study. The study intends to show if a mobile application as a key customer base would be a viable solution. Customer needs and expectations are studied in the customer satisfaction survey. Also qualities of existing mobile applications and key customer mobile applications are benchmarked in the study. The study aims to reflect the current situation and future trends. Knowledge base of the thesis consists of mobile applications, growing mobile markets and the related theories. The applied research method is quantitative. Quantitative method has been utilized in the customer satisfaction survey. The survey was given to students of Oulu University of Applied Sciences, School of Business and Information Management through the intranet 11.12. - 17.12.2013. Total number of responses was 238. The customer satisfaction survey shows interest in a mobile application if an application is easy to download, the content is inviting and has the possibility of personification. The study clarifies new ways to create attractive and innovative content for a mobile application. The study indicates the need for further research, more covering interviews, technical product development and follow up of customer satisfaction after the product has been developed and taken into use.
