Experience-centered design, experience-based design, experience design, designing for experience, user experience design. All of these terms have emerged and gained acceptance in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design relatively recently. In this book, we set out our understanding of experience-centered design as a humanistic approach to designing digital technologies and media that enhance lived experience. The book is divided into three sections. In Section 1, we outline the historical origins and basic concepts that led into and flow out from our understanding of experience as the heart of people's interactions with digital technology. In Section 2, we describe three examples of experience-centered projects and use them to illustrate and explain our dialogical approach. In Section 3, we recapitulate some of the main ideas and themes of the book and discuss the potential of experience-centered design to continue the humanist agenda by giving a voice to those who might otherwise be excluded from design and by creating opportunities for people to enrich their lived experience with- and through- technology.

What is the actual impact of design thinking? Which tools and techniques could conceivably improve team interaction in design processes? What influences creativity? And how can information be secured? These are just a few of the questions that were addressed by research teams from Stanford University, USA, and the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering, Potsdam, Germany, within their joint Design Thinking Research Program. Scientists from both institutions have been studying the user-centric innovation method of design thinking for many years now to gain a deep, evidence-based understanding of its underlying principles and functioning. The outcome of their studies, experiments and investigations in the sixth program year are summarized in this volume. Again research covers a diverse range of design thinking domains. The aim, however, is not only to advance design thinking theory and knowledge within the research community. Rather the program strives to ultimately improve design practice and education by gathering scientific evidence that supports design activities. The first part of this book presents tools and techniques for improved team interaction that have been investigated and developed by the research teams. Creativity and creative confidence as central factors in design thinking are the focus of the second part. The book continues with investigations on the actual impact of design thinking and conceivable metrics. The fourth and final part of the book addresses issues of documentation and information transfer in innovation processes. By taking the understanding of innovation to a new level that is relevant to all disciplines, our research provides a significant contribution toward making design thinking a foundational science.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the leading business model in cloud-computing market. Not only in Oulu but also in Finland, SaaS businesses have been the key driver for the economy. However, to achieve success in building a SaaS start up, it requires a smart business strategy and an efficient product development process in order to not only compete with the competitor but also to achieve user satisfaction. motiMind is a young SaaS startup from Oulu, runs by a group of enthusiastic entrepreneurs and friends who have a long working history together from Nokia. Currently, motiMind is offering an innovative and complete way to monitor well-being and satisfaction of employee in organization. Their product packages streamline from collecting employees responses by mobile application to analysing the information through the system and show the result in the administration site. With the transparency and ease to use of the product, motiMind is on its way to grow further. In this thesis, studies will be conducted to understand how SaaS startups become successful, what the appropriate approach in product development is and how to apply it in motiMinds case.

Abstract: The goal of the thesis was to design and develop a new user interface for an image archive. The archive is accessed on the intranet server through the user's web browser. To limit the scope of the thesis, no changes to the database were planned. The user interface was set to be designed from a user centred point of view. For the design, the users were interviewed. The interview was based on a set group of questions, but the line of questions was not strictly followed during the interview. From the interview it was found out that the image archive has two kinds of users, architects and users working in tourism and travel. Both types of have similar requirements for the archive. The users search the archive for images of a certain building or certain types of images. The users are also required to upload images to the archive. Individual pages of the user interface were designed based on the interviews. On the search page the users can define search conditions and search for images based on the conditions. The search page leads to the results page, which displays search results as thumbnails. The user can inspect images by placing the mouse cursor on top of the thumbnail, which causes metadata for the image to be displayed on a box on the right. From the results page the user can enter a browse view by clicking on a thumbnail. On the browse page the user can see the single image in a larger size and navigate to the previous and next images. In the browse page the user can also edit saved metadata and export images from the archive. Adding images to the archive was were decided to be made easier by adding an batch edit system to the archive, where the user can write metadata information to an image by a single mouse click. The images are added to the archive directly from the user's computer. After development and deployment, the archive user interface has been observed to be useful and functional. Significant improvements include quickly browsing through multiple images and saving images to the user's computer. Feedback from the new archive user interface from the users has been mostly positive.

"How do we design for users? How might users best participate in the design process? How can we evaluate the user's experience of designed products and services? These fundamental questions are addressed in Designers, Users, and Justice, through a series of dialogues between a design scholar and a designer. In a series of conversations, the scholar and the designer address the concepts and practice of user centred design, examining whether a 'just method' necessarily leads to a just design, consider different models for understanding user experience and socially productive design, including the capability approach and utilitarianism, and ponder how an ethical framework for evaluating design might be developed. Throughout, the scholar and the designer draw on their particular experiences in design practice and design education, and propose alternative conceptualisations of the key ideas of user centred design, highlighting and seeking to address the ethical shortcomings of mainstream user centred design practice"--
