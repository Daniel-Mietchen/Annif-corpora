Current practice in the field was driven by the government White Paper 'Valuing People' (2001) which declared some radical aims for services with people with learning difficulties. Now somewhat compromised by the local authority austerity measures, the goals set by 'Valuing People' are nevertheless still important. This third edition seeks to confirm and stringed social work values and principles so that the progress and successes achieved by 'Valuing People' can continue. It includes case studies and activities that draw out the key points and reinforce learning. It summaries of contemporary research are included, as are suggestions for further reading and coverage of current government guidance and policy documents. By examining the varied roles that a social worker might undertake in this field, the authors portray a positive picture of working with people with learning difficulties: the achievements and satisfaction, and the learning and understanding that can be gained. They also highlight the need for recognition of vulnerability, the risk of isolation, oppression and abuse, and the continuing political struggle to establish and protect the rights of the individual.
