In this thesis work there is described the CE-process and product̕s Maturity steps in development process. It was noticed that the early phase of the CE-process design work should be developed towards more functional and modern phase. Reason for this development work was a huge person investment to product̕s plans and the expansion of the first steps of the CE-process. The base for the process renewal was new concepting process proposal. The target was to create more detailed concepting process, which defines working phases before the start of the CE-process. This concepting process was tested in new product̕s concept creation work. Result of this thesis was a description of the Pre E-1 concepting process. By this concepting process work also two new mechanics Maturity Steps were developed: MM-2 and MM-1. The result of these steps is to get more exact opinion for the functionality of the concept results.
