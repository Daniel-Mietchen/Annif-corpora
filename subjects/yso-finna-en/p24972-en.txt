Imagism & the imagists : a study in modern poetry
Set during the World War II air raids in London, H.D.'s fascinating and visionary novel, "Majic Ring", documents her spiritualist activities during this time. Never before published, the work offers a hybrid pastiche of autobiographical, fictional, and epistolary modes of writing. This annotated edition of "Majic Ring" presents important information about H.D.'s personal history, her heterodox interests, and her notions about the creative process itself. It also includes much on the source material for "Trilogy", her well-known three-part poem on the experience of the blitz. In fact, the publication of this novel will change radically the way we read "Trilogy", and will alter profoundly the way we view modernism, the creative process, and women's literary production during mid-century.
