This is a series which introduces a fun and entertaining crime-solving team with great romantic chemistry: fiesty financial analyst Riley Moon and eccentric savant Emerson Knight. Riley Moon is a junior analyst at a mega-bank when she uncovers what looks like an embezzlement scheme that could lead straight to the top. With his gold gone missing and analysts disappearing, famously eccentric Emerson Knight, the bank's biggest client, decides to take on his own investigation. With Emerson's laser-like focus and ability to see clues no one else sees, and Riley's financial-whiz mind and street savvy skills, this unlikely pair will uncover one of the biggest crimes of the century.
