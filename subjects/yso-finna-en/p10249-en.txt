Maximum mentoring : an action guide for teacher trainers and cooperating teachers
This book explores the highly significant and contested area of graduate employability and employment which is paid so much attention by those in the media and policy-makers. This is driven largely by concerns over the wider economic impact and value of graduates as increasing numbers complete their studies in higher education. At a time when graduates are seen as key to economic success, the critical question remains as to how their employability plays out in a changing labour market. This book brings together innovative approaches and research to present an extensive survey of the field. It provides insight on what is a complex and often elusive social and economic problem, ranging from how graduate employability is constructed as an economic and policy agenda to explorations of how graduates manage the transition from higher education to paid employment and finally to suggest future directions for curricula, policy and research.

Demonstrates how the success of universities depends on the working conditions of the younger academic generation. Young faculty are the future of academia, yet without attractive career paths for young academics, the future of the university is bleak. Featuring case studies from Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Norway, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, and the United States, Young Faculty in the Twenty-First Century is the first book to analyze issues facing early-career higher education faculty in an international context. The contributors discuss how young academics are affected by contracts, salaries, the structure of careers, and institutional conditions. The analyses cover the full spectrum of the academic profession, including part-time jobs and short-term contracts, both in public and private institutions. The book also addresses what universities must do in order to attract young, qualified candidates.
