Redescription of the larva of Siobla ruficornis (Gimmerthal, 1834) (Hymeoptera, Tenthredinidae) from Finland
Raspberry production and consumption is increasing worldwide, and the fruit's potential health benefits are becoming more widely acknowledged. This is the only book available that focuses in depth on raspberries. It offers International coverage of the modern raspberry industry including North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It covers all aspects of raspberry growing, including plant growth and development, cultivar description and selection, site selection and preparation, climate, pest control, irrigation, shipping, economics, harvesting and marketing the final product. It includes hundreds of references and nearly eighty full colour plates. It is suitable for horticulture students, raspberry growers, producers and fruit industry personnel.
