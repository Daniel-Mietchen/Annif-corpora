Speech motor control in normal and disordered speech
To interact with the environment, an individual must code, store and translate spatial information into the appropriate motor commands. Working from this premise, this new book discusses how visual perception, attention and memory are linked to the processes of movement. As a resource for motor control and motor learning researchers, students, educators and clinicians, this book offers comprehensive coverage of current literature on the visual control of goal-directed movement. The book also presents a systematic explication of the sensory and physiological processes and systems responsible for fast, accurate and efficient performance. The final part of the text provides a review of recent research on how and why limb control changes occur with practice and development. In addition, the book considers how the research presented can maximise precision, efficiency and safety in workspace design.
