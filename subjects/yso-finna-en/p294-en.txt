The main purpose of this study was to find out how much physiotherapy services are used by people with Parkinson's disease in the Satakunta District, and whether or not they feel that physiotherapy is beneficial in improving activities of daily living.  This study was intended to assist the Finnish Parkinson Association with their ongoing project to improve the rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease.    This research was a non-experimental descriptive quantitative survey, where data was collected by mailed questionnaires.  The methods used to acquire subjects were the convenience and systematic sampling methods.  The final subject group consisted of 48 people with Parkinson's disease.  This sample included 19 female and 29 male subjects, age group ranging from 53 to 80 years.    The results of this study revealed that people with Parkinson's disease do use physiotherapy services, however not to the fullest capacity.  The majority of subjects did not receive physiotherapy until a few years after their diagnosis, which does not correspond with the recommendations found in theory.  However subjects who have received physiotherapy treatment for Parkinson's disease seem to be pleased with the effects and consider it beneficial.  Physiotherapeutic treatment is desirable both by those who have and have not experienced it.    More research is needed in defining the reasons why physiotherapy is not used to the fullest advantage for people with Parkinson's disease, the specific types of physiotherapy they are offered, and if the benefits experienced are possible to measure.
