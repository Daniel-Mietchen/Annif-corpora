Due to the lack of energy resources, European governments have started to establish new legislation a few years ago. In its turn, Ministry of Environment of Finland published a new guide for the calculation of linear thermal transmittance in April 2012, which is the main feature of thermal bridges in buildings that lead to significant heat losses. The aim of this thesis work is to make an analysis of thermal bridging in a high-rise building, determine the importance of linear thermal bridges on the total heat loss of the building and compare particular values of linear thermal transmittances with tabulated values given in National Building Code D5, in order to answer the question of their reliability and quality of design of joints. As well, the current work should help students and engineers, who do not speak Finnish, to use the guide mentioned above. Determination of linear thermal transmittance is possible by applying different methods described in ISO 14683. Nevertheless, in the current work the results were achieved by numerical calculation, which typically gives an accuracy from 0 to 5 % instead of the accuracy of reference tables from 0 to 50%. The survey was carried out in accordance with the international and Finnish standards. For computer simulation, COMSOL Multiphysics software was chosen. Finally, the evaluated linear thermal transmittance had an absolute difference from 17 up to 200% with the tabulated values. The heat losses due to linear thermal bridges took 13% of the value of total heat losses of the building. These results show the importance of the current study and obligation of obtaining of linear thermal transmittances and heat losses of thermal bridges, as their sizes are comparable with heat losses of doors and even bigger than heat losses of basements and upper floors, which generally have the highest risk.

The topic of this thesis was offered by Mypose Oy, a startup company based in Oulu, Finland. Their primary products are impressive photo machines, which can be utilized by businesses to transform customers into brand ambassadors in social media. As the company has been expanding its business, there was a requirement to improve their analytics system, so that statistical insights of marketing campaigns using Mypose machines would be delivered to customer quickly and punctually. The thesis was divided into two distinct parts, in which the first one focused on the fundamental concepts of social media and social marketing, as well as the methods to identify, collect and aggregate metrics on social networks in order to calculate useful key performance indicators (KPIs). It also included studies about the values of email in modern marketing strategies, and methods to measure email effectiveness. The second part involved designing a new analytics system. It included examining different flows of Mypose photos to identify possible metrics, and determining proper methods to collect and compute KPIs based on accumulated statistical values. Additionally, a brief database modification and user interface designs for the new system were also discussed. The final result was the prototype of a new analytics system that was rich of functionalities, comprehensively visualized and easy to extend. Various parts of the outcome were developed and functioned in production during the course of writing this thesis. It also exposed some concerns about further development of the system.

This thesis was done for Oulu University of Applied Sciences Sula project. In the thesis electricity consumption of a garage was examined using classic time series analysis and search for correlation between power consumption and difference between outside and inside temperatures. Also, forecasts were made for power consumption and thermal conductance by applying linear re-gression. In thesis’s context thermal conductance was defined as power con-sumption needed to increase the temperature difference between inside and outside air by one Celsius centigrade. The purpose was to find a programmable way to detect a broken heating device from increased electricity consumption. The program should be able to run au-tomatically on the Sula server. Using time series analysis, trend and irregular components were detected from the electricity consumption measurement. With coefficient of determination linear correlation between the energy consumption and temperature difference was proven. Power consumption forecast had the difference between outside and inside temperature as the explanatory variable. The forecast was good at comparing the last measured power consumption with certain temperature difference to average power consumption with the same temperature difference. The fore-cast was slow in adjusting to different kind of power consumption when used devices were changed, because the forecast method requires high number of observations. If the used devices would always be the same then this forecast method would be suitable for the purpose. Conductance forecasts were faster in adjusting when the used devices were changed, but it can also be a downside because if the forecast adjusts too fast, it’s useless detecting increased consumption. The adjusting speed is deter-mined by the number of observations used. With high number of observations the forecast doesn’t adjust too fast and is more suitable for the purpose.
