Russians are an important customer segment in Finnish tourism. They make over two thirds of the whole amount of foreign tourists coming to Finland per year. Tourism infrastructure in Tampere region is versatile and potential. The problem is that no large scale efforts are made to attract Russian travelers to Tampere. This research was made to construct an operative model for strategic cooperation network which would act as a tourism development organization concentrating on Russian customers. The network model represents a strategic cooperation between research and development operators and tourism companies in the Tampere region. This collaboration aims to utilize the knowledge resources of both parties in strategically planned processes. The objective of these processes is allocating and conceptualizing the tourism supply for Russian customers through product development. The prospects of making the Tampere region a more attractive travelling destination to Russian customers is feasible. It does not require extensive operations, but it can be done with developing products/services and service readiness/competency. The main objectives are to satisfy current needs of Russian customers, to create more demand and to productize the tourism supply considering Russian travelers.
