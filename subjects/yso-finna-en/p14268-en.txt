The evolution of insect mating systems
The Evolution of Insect Mating Systems by Thornhill and Alcock was one of the key texts that helped define modern behavioural ecology. Published in 1983, it has had a huge impact in shaping "adaptationist" approaches to the study of animal behaviour, ending up far more than the sum of its parts, and influencing the study of the evolution of reproductive behaviour far beyond the taxonomic remit of insects. While much in the original remains relevant today, our aim in this edited volume is to bring together some of world's leading insect researchers to bring the empirical and conceptual scope of the original book up to date. We explore the evolution of often complex forms of sex determination in insects, and the role of sexual selection in shaping the evolution of mating systems. Selection arising via male contest competition and female choice, both before and after copulation are discussed, as are the roles of parasites and pathogens in mediating the strength of sexual selection, and the role that parental care plays in successful reproduction.

Sexual selection results from competition between individuals over access to gametes of the opposite sex. Starting with anisogamy, with females producing larger and fewer gametes than males, females usually invest more in reproduction and thus have lower potential reproductive rates than males. Therefore males are traditionally suggested to compete over females whereas females are choosy. The different evolutionary interests between the sexes result in different selection regimes considering e.g. mating rates. In some species, this conflict is even seen as apparent struggles between males and females over mating decision and/or duration, resulting in antagonistic coevolution with both sexes evolving adaptations to gain more control over the other sex. In this thesis, I studied the role of A. paludum female abdominal spines as an adaptation to reject male mating attempts. I studied both the effect of polyandry and multiple matings on female fecundity to distinguish between the potential material and genetic benefits from mating to females. I also explored the role of various male and female morphological traits on precopulatory sexual selection and the consequent female reproductive output. My results show that female abdominal spines are likely evolved through arms races between the sexes to increase female control over mating decision but according to my studies, female spines are not under active selection. Instead, certain male morphological types were more successful in achieving matings, and mating with these males also increased female fecundity. I found that multiple matings increase female fecundity up to a point, supporting a theory of optimal female mating rate. According to my results, the benefits from multiple mating to A. paludum females result from material origin whereas polyandry per se is even detrimental to female fecundity.^

We trust our sciences to operate on a plane of objectivity and fact in a world of subjectivity and cultural ideologies, but should we? In The Age of Scientific Sexism, philosopher Mari Ruti offers a sharp critique of the gender profiling tendencies of evolutionary psychology, untangling the insidious threads of various gender mythologies that have infiltrated-or perhaps even define-this faux-science. Selling stereotypes as scientific facts, evolutionary psychology continually brings retrograde models of sexuality into mainstream culture: it insists that men and women live in two completely different psychological, emotional, and sexual universes, and that they will consequently always be locked in a vicious battle of the sexes. Among these regressive arguments is the assumption that men's sexuality is urgent and indiscriminate, whereas women are "naturally" reluctant, reticent, and choosy-a concept constructed to justify masculine behavior, such as cheating, that women have historically found painful. On its most basic level, The Age of Scientific Sexism explores our impulse to "explain" romantic behavior through science: in the increasingly egalitarian gender landscape of our society, why are we so eager to embrace the rampant gender profiling that evolutionary psychology promotes? Perhaps these simplistic gender caricatures owe their popularity, at least in part, to our overly pragmatic society pragmatic society, which encourages us to search for easy answers to complex questions.

Degrees of Choice provides a sophisticated account of the overlapping effects of social class, ethnicity and gender in the process of choosing which university to attend. The shift from an elite to a mass system has been accompanied by much political rhetoric about widening access, achievement-for-all and meritocratic equalisation. This book gives a full and contrary picture, drawing on qualitative and quantitative data to show how the welcome expansion of higher education has also deepened social stratification, generating new and different inequalities. While gender inequalities have reduced, those of social class remain and are now reinforced by racial inequalities in access. Employing perspectives from the sociology of education and particularly Bourdieu's work on distinction and judgement, the book links school institutional habitus and family class habitus, with individual choice making in a socially informed dynamic. The contradictions and tensions arising from attempts to expand student numbers rapidly are vividly brought alive through the narratives of prospective applicants to higher education. Students are seen to confront vastly different degrees of choice that are powerfully shaped by their social class and race. This rich empirical study of 500 applicants to higher education draws on an award winning enquiry funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. It will be essential reading in sociology, social policy and education, and important to higher education providers and careers teachers.
The genial gene : deconstructing Darwinian selfishness
This book presents an accessible and sometimes controversial economic exploration of numerous issues surrounding sex, marriage and family. It analyzes the role of 'vanity', defined as social status and self-esteem, in social and economic behaviors. In Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption, vanity is associated with the consumption of luxuries such as expensive handbags and cars. In this book, Simon Fan provocatively argues that vanity is obtained by having a spouse and children with perceived 'high-quality' values, for example, a beautiful wife, a tall husband or intelligent offspring. He demonstrates from various perspectives that vanity plays a crucial role in male - female relationships and intergenerational relationships. In so doing, he challenges the conventional frontier of economics and contributes to other social sciences. This unique book will appeal to the educated general reader and interested academic alike.
Bondar examines the sex lives of our animal cousins, which are fiendishly difficult, infinitely varied, and often violent. They involve razor sharp penises, murderous cannibals, and chemical warfare in an epic battle between the sexes. Like us, animals must first find the perfect partner. You think we have it tough? Try having to do it while being hunted down by predators, against a backdrop of unpredictable or life-threatening conditions. Then, sperm and egg must successfully meet. Can you imagine doing this when your partner is intent on killing you or when other disgruntled singles are determined to throw you off your game?
