A music lover's guide to record collecting
Music business is going through dramatic changes as Internet has evolved into more social and instant place. People demand a lot more from music and are more aware of what happens in the music industry. They want to get instant access to music and they are not willing to spend a lot of money on CDs. Also bands are more willing to try to succeed on their own without any help from record labels, because Internet and social media have made it easier for them. The change has also influenced strongly on record labels. Major record labels have started to loose their profit from CDs and many famous artists have left the majors and try to manage on their own. Finnish market is still dominated by major record labels which have put pressure on independent record labels to expand their operations abroad for better income. Many independent record labels have small financial resources and in order to expand to the foreign market they need to find cost effective ways to do that. Viral marketing via Internet is a very effective channel which doesn't require big budget. This thesis focus on a company HoneyBaby Records, and on the independent record labels in general. Methods of Internet marketing are investigated as they are essential for a record label which tries to generate profit and get awareness in an international market with a low budget. Opinions of regular consumers of music about music business and the meaning of record labels were inquired in order to find out a general conception about the state of music industry today. This thesis reveals that some good and effective ways for an independent record label to expand its operation into international market are using social media for creation of contacts, cooperation with foreign bars, clubs and studios and appealing to foreign bands and artist to get them to sign contracts.
