When the first edition of this book was published in 2009, the mandatory carriage of ECDIS had been agreed at IMO but implementation seemed a long way off. On 1 July 2012 a comprehensive rolling phase-in schedule began and this second edition recognises that practical guidance on equipment, training and operational practices is now needed urgently. Everything you need to understand in order to manage this fundamental change from navigating by paper charts to navigating by ECDIS is covered. This theoretical knowledge is made real through contributions from sea-going members of The Nautical Institute who have been using electronic charts for some time. Unsurprisingly, many of these contributions relate to training. Best practice is encapsulated in the industry recommendations for ECDIS training and familiarisation (including a familiarisation checklist), drawn up by a group coordinated by the Institute, which are included as appendices.

Advances in mobile mapping technology
Over the last fifty years, humanity has developed an extraordinary global utility which is omnipresent, universal, and available to all: the Global Positioning System (GPS). A network of twenty-four satellites and their monitoring stations on Earth, it makes possible almost all modern technology, from the smartphone in your pocket to the Mars rover. Neither the internet nor the cloud would work without it. And it is changing us in profound ways we've yet to come to terms with. Pinpoint tells the remarkable story of GPS, from its conceptual origins as a bomb guidance system to its present status as one of the most important technologies in the world. Yet while GPS has brought us breathtakingly accurate methods of timekeeping, navigation, and earthquake tracking, our overwhelming reliance on it is having unexpected consequences on our culture, and on ourselves. GPS is reshaping our thinking about privacy and surveillance, and brings with it the growing danger of GPS terrorism. And neuroscientists have even found that using GPS for navigation may be affecting our cognitive maps - possibly rearranging the grey matter in our heads - leading to the increasingly common phenomenon 'Death by GPS', in which drivers blindly follow their devices into deserts, lakes, and impassable mountains. Deeply researched, inventive and with fascinating insights into the way we think about our place in the world, Pinpoint reveals the way that the technologies we design to help us can end up shaping our lives. It is at once a grand history of science and a far-reaching book about contemporary culture.

Divided into three sections, the book includes the complete syllabus for Electrotechnology Officers as specified by the Association of Marine Electronic and Radio Colleges (AMERC), with each section providing a series of questions and answers that will give the student practice at working at the examination level.The book introduces basic electronics, physical concepts of atoms and how electricity flows, conductors, insulators. It also introduces resistors, semiconductors, capacitor inductors and tuned circuits.The book explores the theory of how a range of navigational aids and radio systems work, how to operate and test them, and how to fault find to component or sub system level. Additionally, it includes theory of how radio communications systems work, how to operate them, and how to fault find to component or subsystem level.Importantly, this is the first textbook to be aimed primarily at ETOs, covering the changes to the STCW 2010.

"Describing the relevant detection and estimation theory, this detailed guide provides the background knowledge needed to tackle the design of practical WLAN positioning systems. It sets out key system-level challenges and design considerations in increasing positioning accuracy and reducing computational complexity, and it also examines design trade-offs and experimental results. Radio characteristics in real environments are discussed, as are the theoretical aspects of non-parametric statistical tools appropriate for modeling radio signals, statistical estimation techniques and the model-based stochastic estimators often used for positioning. A historical account of positioning systems in also included, giving graduate students, researchers and practitioners alike the perspective needed to understand the benefits and potential applications of WLAN positioning"--Provided by publisher.

When the first edition of this book was published in The objective of this book is to impart practical hands-on knowledge about ECDIS. For less-experienced users, the book will help them to gain a valuable overview of the principles of ECDIS navigation and the related challenges. Meanwhile, it is likely that advanced ECDIS operators will also be able to find new answers and helpful suggestions. Based upon the principles of the IMO Model Course 1.27, the book is suitable for all kinds of ECDIS courses in different settings.
