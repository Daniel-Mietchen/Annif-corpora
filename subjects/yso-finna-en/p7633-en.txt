John King sets out the distinctive features of Post Keynesian economics and their implications for the assessment of alternative proposals for domestic and international macroeconomic policy. He begins by outlining the core elements of Post Keynesian theory and explaining how it differs from other schools, including the so-called 'Old Keynesian' and 'New Keynesian' theories. Subsequent chapters deal with the important methodological issues that distinguish the Post Keynesians from mainstream economists as well as their treatment of firms, workers and households, the analysis of economic growth and development, and international economics. The Post Keynesian approach to monetary and fiscal policy, incomes and the environment is also summarised, with particular attention being paid to controversies over austerity and the reform of the financial sector and international monetary system. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 is used as a case study to illustrate many of the significant theoretical and policy questions raised in previous chapters. The relationship between Post Keynesian and other branches of heterodox economics are explored, and the book concludes with a brief discussion of the future prospects for the Post Keynesian school.

Post-Keynesian and heterodox economics challenge the mainstream economics theories that dominate the teaching at universities and government economic policies. And it was these latter theories that helped to cause the great depression the United States and the rest of the world is in. However, most economists and the top 1% do not want mainstream theories challengedâ€•for to do so would mean questioning why and how the 1% got where they are. Therefore, numerous efforts have been and are being made to discredit if not suppress Post-Keynesian and heterodox economics. These efforts have had some success; this book is a response to them. This book makes it clear that Post Keynesian/heterodox economics is, in spite of internal problems, a viable and important approach to economics and that it should resist the attempts of the critics to bury it. The reader will also find arguments that directly engage the critics and suggest that their views/criticisms are vacuous and wrong.

Possibly the strangest phenomenon in all of economics is the absence of a long tradition of criticism focused on Keynesian economic theory. Keynesian demand management has been at the centre of some of the worst economic outcomes in history, from the great stagflation of the 1970s to the lost decade and more in Japan following the expenditure program of the 1990s. And once again, following the Global Financial Crisis, it is incontrovertible that no stimulus program in any part of the world has been a success, each one having been abandoned as conditions deteriorated under the weight of public.

In defense of post-Keynesian and heterodox economics : responses to their critics
The ideas of John Maynard Keynes inspired the New Deal and helped rebuild world economies after World War II--and were later dismissed as "depression economics." Then came the great meltdown of 2008. Market forces that the world relied on suddenly failed to self-correct--and Keynes's doctrine of corrective action in an imperfect world became more relevant than ever. Keynes was not a traditional economist: he was a polemicist, an iconoclastic public intellectual, a peer of the realm, and a political operative, as well as an openly homosexual bohemian who befriended Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster. Here, historian Peter Clarke provides a timely accounting of Keynes's life and work, bringing his genius and skepticism alive for an era fraught with economic difficulties that he surely would have relished solving.
