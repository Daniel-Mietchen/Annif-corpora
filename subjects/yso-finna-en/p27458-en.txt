This volume presents the proceedings of the ninth workshop of the international network 'Impact of Empire', which concentrates on the history of the Roman Empire and brings together ancient historians, archaeologists, classicists and specialists on Roman law from some thirty European, North American and Australian universities. This volume focuses on different ways in which the Roman Empire created, changed and influenced (perceptions of) frontiers. The volume is divided into five larger sections: the meaning of 'frontiers', consequences of frontiers, religious frontiers, shifting... read morefrontiers and crossing 'frontiers'. In this way, the volume pays attention to different kind of 'frontiers' within the Roman Empire, and to their importance for the functioning of the Roman Empire over a longer period of time.
The tin drum
The Roman Empire was the largest and most enduring of the ancient world. From its zenith under Augustus and Trajan in the first century AD to its decline and fall amidst the barbarian invasions of the fifth century, the Empire guarded and maintained a frontier that stretched for 5,000 kilometres, from Carlisle to Cologne, from Augsburg to Antioch, and from Aswan to the Atlantic. Far from being at the periphery of the Roman world, the frontier played a crucial role in making and breaking emperors, creating vibrant and astonishingly diverse societies along its course which pulsed with energy while the centre became enfeebled and sluggish. This remarkable new book traces the course of those frontiers, visiting all its astonishing sites, from Hadrian's Wall in the north of Britain to the desert cities of Palmyra and Leptis Magna. It tells the fascinating stories of the men and women who lived and fought along it, from Alaric the Goth, who descended from the Danube to sack Rome in 410, to Zenobia the desert queen, who almost snatched the entire eastern provinces from Rome in the third century. It is at their edges, in time and geographical extent, that societies reveal their true nature, constantly seeking to recreate and renew themselves. In this examination of the places that the mighty Roman Empire stopped expanding, Philip Parker reveals how and why the Empire endured for so long, as well as describing the rich and complex architectural and cultural legacy which it has bequeathed to us.

This is the first major comparative study of the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, one of the crucial forces that shaped the modern world. The essays combine archaeological and historical approaches to further understanding of how this major empire approached the challenge of controlling frontiers as diverse and far-flung as Central and Eastern Europe, Anatolia, Iraq, Arabia, and the Sudan. Ranging across the 15th to early 20th centuries, essays cover frontier fortifications, administration, society, and economy and shed light on the Ottomans' interaction with their neighbours, both Muslim and Christian, through warfare, trade and diplomacy. As well as summing up the current state of knowledge they also point the way to fresh avenues of research. The Frontiers of the Ottoman World will be essential reading for historians and archaeologists of the Middle East and early modern Central and Eastern Europe. Giving a particular prominence to the nascent discipline of Ottoman archaeology, the volume will also be of particular interest to students of Islamic archaeology.

Do the Romans have anything to teach us about the way that they saw the world, and the way they ran their empire? How did they deal with questions of frontiers and migration, so often in the news today? This collection of ten important essays by C. R. Whittaker, engages with debates and controversies about the Roman frontiers and the concept of empire. Truly global in its focus, the book examines the social, political and cultural implications of the Roman frontiers in Africa, India, Britain, Europe, Asia and the Far East, and provides a comprehensive account of their significance.
