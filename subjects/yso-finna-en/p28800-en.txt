Handbook of normative data for neuropsychological assessment
"When Handbook of Normative Data for Neuropsychological Assessment was originally published in 1999, it was the first book to provide neuropsychologists with summaries and critiques of normative data for neuropsychological tests." "Locator tables guide the reader to the sets of normative data that are best suited to each individual case, depending on the demographic characteristics of the patient, and highlight the advantages associated with using data for comparative purposes. Those using the book have the option of reading the authors' critical review of the normative data for a particular test, or simply turning to the appropriate data locator table for a quick reference to the relevant data tables in the Appendices." "The second edition includes reviews of 15 new tests. The way the data are presented has been changed to make the book easier to use. Meta-analysis tables of predicted values for different ages (and education, where relevant) are included for nine tests that have a sufficient number of homogeneous datasets." "No other reference offers such an effective framework for the critical evaluation of normative data for neuropsychological tests. Like the first, the second edition will be welcomed by practitioners, researchers, teachers, and graduate students as a unique and valuable contribution to the practice of neuropsychology."--BOOK JACKET.
