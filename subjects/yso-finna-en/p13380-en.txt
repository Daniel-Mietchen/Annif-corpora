A semantic Web primer
Explorer's guide to the Semantic Web
Providing effective access to information resources remains a critical role of the information professional in today's digital world. If anything, it has become an even greater challenge, as domains converge and the amount of information available continues to grow exponentially. This book provides a systematic overview of the ways in which information resources are being described so as to facilitate their access across a wide range of contexts. The focus is on metadata used in contemporary systems and environments: Who creates it? How is it created? What makes some better than others? How is it shared? Information Resource Description serves as a primer on the rewarding field of information organization. It integrates the rich traditions of established fields, such as librarianship and archival studies, with emerging ones, such as information architecture and the Semantic Web, to produce a commentary on the enduring value and relevance of indexing and description for those interested in providing quality information. This commentary is based on fundamental concepts represented by key standards such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), Resource Description and Access (RDA), and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Key topics include: information resource attributes, metadata tools and systems, metadata sources, metadata quality, sharing metadata, metadata standards, vocabularies, the future of metadata. This book is essential reading for LIS students taking information organization courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, information professionals wishing to specialize in the metadata field, and existing metadata specialists who wish to update their knowledge.

The fourth edition of the late Lois Mai Chan's classic Cataloging and Classification covers the analysis and representation of methods used in describing, organizing, and providing access to resources made available in or through libraries. Resource Description and Access (RDA) is the new standard developed by the Library of Congress. With the help of the coauthor, Athena Salaba, this text is modified throughout to conform to the new standard. Retaining the overall outline of the previous edition, this text presents the essence of library cataloging and classification in terms of three basic functions: descriptive cataloging, subject access, and classification. This book is the standard text for the teaching and understanding of cataloging and classification.
