Association football is now the global sport, consumed in various ways by millions of people across the world. Throughout its history, football has been a catalyst as much for social cohesion, unity, excitement and integration as it can be for division, exclusion and discrimination. A Sociology of Football in a Global Context examines the historical, political, economic, social and cultural complexities of the game across Europe, Africa, Asia and North and South America. It analyses the key developments and sociological debates within football through a topic-based approach that concentrates on the history of football and its global diffusion; the role of violence; the global governance of the game by FIFA; race, racism and whiteness; gender and homophobia; the changing nature of fans; the media and football's financial revolution; the transformation of players into global celebrities; and the growth of football leagues across the world. Using a range of examples from all over the world, each chapter highlights the different social and cultural changes football has seen, most notably since the 1990s, when its relationship with the mass media and other transnational networks became more important and financially lucrative.

George Best, the mercurial Manchester United and Northern Ireland forward, possessed a genius that left opponents slack-jawed and earned him a legion of adoring fans. Off the pitch, as his striking good looks, devil-may-care attitude and mischievous charm made him the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status, Best became an icon. But fame came at a price, and his playing career was soon overshadowed by his lifestyle and an increasing dependence on the comforting embrace of alcohol. Whilst his tumultuous later years could never diminish the memories of the peerless, often breathtaking, quality of his football, they had a profound effect on his only son, Calum. Growing up with his mother in California, Calum's sporadic visits to see his father in England were all too rare, and he cherished every moment he could spend in the company of the man he adored. But as George's alcoholism spiralled out of control, inebriation frequently led to violence and George's self-destruction spilled over onto his son. Vivid, deeply moving, brave and honest, Second Best is the heart-breaking story of their relationship. It is a powerful tale of love and heartache, of an absent father and his wayward son, and of a family torn apart by addiction and intemperance.
