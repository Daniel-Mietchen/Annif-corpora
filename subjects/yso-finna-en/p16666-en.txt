The topic of this thesis was offered by Mypose Oy, a startup company based in Oulu, Finland. Their primary products are impressive photo machines, which can be utilized by businesses to transform customers into brand ambassadors in social media. As the company has been expanding its business, there was a requirement to improve their analytics system, so that statistical insights of marketing campaigns using Mypose machines would be delivered to customer quickly and punctually. The thesis was divided into two distinct parts, in which the first one focused on the fundamental concepts of social media and social marketing, as well as the methods to identify, collect and aggregate metrics on social networks in order to calculate useful key performance indicators (KPIs). It also included studies about the values of email in modern marketing strategies, and methods to measure email effectiveness. The second part involved designing a new analytics system. It included examining different flows of Mypose photos to identify possible metrics, and determining proper methods to collect and compute KPIs based on accumulated statistical values. Additionally, a brief database modification and user interface designs for the new system were also discussed. The final result was the prototype of a new analytics system that was rich of functionalities, comprehensively visualized and easy to extend. Various parts of the outcome were developed and functioned in production during the course of writing this thesis. It also exposed some concerns about further development of the system.

In this thesis, several methods of filtering or preventing spam are analyzed. As spam is becoming more and more commonplace, finding an effective way of minimizing the harm it causes can save people from losing money through scams, hacks, and counterfeit products.  The filtering techniques discussed include origin-based filtering, adaptive filtering, filtering of image-based spam, ISP filtering, and litigious techniques. Of all the filters examined in the thesis, adaptive techniques such as Bayesian filtering were shown to give the best results and have the greatest potential for stopping spam in the future. The strongest benefit of adaptive techniques is that they can easily be taught to respond to new types of spam, even by the users of the e-mail services themselves. The thesis contains an empirical part consisting of two separate experiments. The first part is a test to find which free e-mail service provides the best spam filtering out of Yahoo's Yahoo mail, Google's Gmail and Microsoft's Hotmail. Of the three, Yahoo mail was found to have the best spam filtering, since the filter caught spam from previously white-listed contacts. A second test with an origin-based filter was conducted on a private server. The aim of the test was to see how well the filter handled spam coming from unknown sources. It managed to consistently block all spam coming from one particular domain, but failed to block spam coming from some other domains.
