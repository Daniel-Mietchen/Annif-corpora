Abstract: How does Enneagram help in developing emotional intelligence at work? This advisory report has been conducted for Hogeschool INHolland Diemen as a part of the graduation programme in International Business and Management Studies. The purpose of the advisory report is to prepare the students for professional working life and test their analytical and consulting skills. The researcher, Mr. Sampsa Raitam√§ki, is a fourth year Finnish double degree student from Metropolia Business School, Metropolia UAS. Alongside studies, the researcher had interest in a personality theory model called Enneagram. The advisory report was a great opportunity to combine Enneagram with the IBMS studies. Therefore the researcher decided to examine the connection between Enneagram and emotional intelligence at business context. A requirement for the advisory report was to find a client whom to work with. The client for this project was TMI Leena Aijasaho, a Finnish sole entrepreneur who offers professional work supervisor and coaching services for various companies and organisations.
