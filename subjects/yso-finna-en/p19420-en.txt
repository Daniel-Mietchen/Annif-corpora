Creating an employee handbook for Youth Centre Villa Elba Oy
Communication gaps can be devastating for any business in today's competitive and fast paced environment. In the hospital setting, it can literally be a matter of life or death. The purpose of the project was to develop and evaluate the effect of three evidence-based internal communication practices on employee engagement for pediatric hospital in Louisville, KY. This was the first known systematic investigation of communication strategies in a hospital setting. The evidence based practices include: Interactive Employee Forums, Wednesday Weekly newsletter and a Communication Portal page. After one year of this practice change, the following questions were asked and evaluated: Will internal communication practices have a significant impact on this hospital employee engagement? As compared to peer institutions within this multi-hospital organization, will this pediatric hospital have a greater increase in mean engagement scores, as a result of these practices? The result were not statistically significant, however some ceiling effect was observed. The pediatric hospital did increase percentage of engaged by 3%, the highest improvement of all five hospitals within the system.

Engaged knowledge management : engagement with new realities
This thesis was commissioned by SOL Palvelut Oy (3321). As a leading company in the cleaning industry, SOL considers its employees as one of the most valuable assets in sustaining the company's competitive advantage. Therefore, retaining and motivating the employees has become the top concern of the company. In the study reported here, the motivation of the employees at SOL is examined with intent to gain feedback regarding training offered by the company.   The aim of this project is to find out the current situation as to employee motivation and the effects on employee retention; and give company a general image on how the employees react to the training provided. The theoretical part is draws from the two-factor theory proposed by Fredrick Herzberg. A questionnaire was formulated in order to gather empirical evidence. One-quarter of the employees were selected at random from SOL 3321 area, and the questionnaire was delivered to them either by email or by mail.   The outcome is analyzed and related recommendations are provided in the end of this report. The study showed that not all the respondents were motivated with SOL, and some of them did not have any plans for working for SOL on a long-term base. In order to reverse the situation, the author gives recommendations regarding the compensation system of SOL, substance and emotional encouraging, and employee involvement with the company.  .

"Strengths-Based Recruitment and Development explains how and why strengths-based recruitment (SBR) is having a transformational impact on performance in top companies like Saga, Gap, Starbucks and SABMiller. By shifting the focus from what people can do (competency-based recruitment) to what they naturally enjoy doing, or SBR, these companies have reported results which include a 50% drop in staff turnover, 20% increase in productivity and a 12% increase in customer satisfaction within a matter of months. It is no wonder that organizations in many sectors are adopting this new and powerful approach to improve performance, customer satisfaction and competitive edge. Strengths-Based Recruitment and Development includes case studies and interviews with executive board level leaders. These provide rare insight into how they implemented strengths approaches in their organizations to improve the bottom line and performance. The book shows how strengths-based talent management goes beyond simply recruiting the right people to creating a strategy and culture that has a transformational effect on organisational culture and results. Strengths-Based Recruitment and Development will be the go-to book on strengths-based talent management for HR professionals and managers"--

The drivers of employee engagement
The main objective of this research-based thesis was to understand how well employ-ees were supported and managed during their role as part of a major change initiative, and how this has influenced their engagement to the case organization. Two theories were drawn upon to support the empirical study and they provided the foundation for the theoretical framework. Change Management served as the primary theory, and Employee Engagement was selected as the secondary theory due to its influence on, and relationship with the successful implementation, management and integration of organizational change. The theoretical framework was further supported with recent reports published by leading practitioners in the human resources community. The empirical study targeted personnel working directly on the change project in a number of project teams spread out across the globe, in addition to personnel who were working independently as the person in charge (PIC) in specific areas of the pro-ject. The research design comprised of a quantitative and qualitative web-based survey questionnaire, administered on November 25th, 2013. The key findings of the survey revealed that overall the change project had been effec-tively managed and supported at all levels of the organization from the perspective of the project team members. A generally positive response to questions surrounding engagement led me to believe the case organization is successfully ensuring that person-nel feel valued and involved in their current roles. The main development suggestions for the case company based on the results of the survey propose the following:  - improvement of the effectiveness and timeliness of communication  - further development of personnel through change management training  - additional clarity with the realignment of goals and objectives  - ensuring personnel are able to balance their full workload.

In recent years there has been a weight of evidence suggesting that engagement has a significantly positive impact on productivity, performance and organisational advocacy, as well as individual wellbeing, and a significantly negative impact on intent to quit and absenteeism from the work place. This comprehensive new book is unique as it brings together, for the first time, psychological and critical HRM perspectives on engagement as well as their practical application. Employee Engagement in Theory and Practice will familiarise readers with the concepts and core themes that have been explored in research and their application in a business context via a set of carefully chosen and highly relevant original and case studies, some of which are co-authored by invited practitioners. Written in an accessible manner, this book will be essential reading for scholars in the field, students studying at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, as well as practitioners interested in finding out more about the theoretical underpinnings of engagement alongside its practical application.
Social media at work : / how networking tools propel organizational performance
Social commerce is an emerging phenomenon and consumers' acceptance of it has set a challenge for marketing today. The proliferation of Web 2.O technologies has brought consumers to spend most of the time online at different platforms of social media to connect with their family and friends. These mere connectivity, entertainment, and socialization platforms possess a huge potential to drive businesses. The main premise here is that social networking sites have been tremendously popular, especially Facebook, which has led to more integration of consumers and retailers. Consumers, unintentionally or subconsciously, are coming across information about their preferred brands at Facebook and their decision making is influenced through this. In this regard, a study is required that examines consumers' acceptance behavior in social commerce settings. This dissertation contributes to the existing knowledge of the new phenomenon of social commerce in marketing literature. It highlights the consumers' aspects of the acceptance of social commerce and contributes to the theoretical discussions on three levels: (i) it provides a general framework for engaging consumers online through traditional means (e-commerce) and new means (social commerce); (ii) it identifies the various consumer segments present at the most popular social networking site, Facebook; and finally (iii) it extends the recently devised modelâ€”the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2)â€”with constructs such as trust, perceived security, and perceived privacy in order to identify consumers' trust in the new stream of social commerce. The main aim of this study is to understand consumers' acceptance of social commerce empirically, in a way that enlightens the theoretical implications and enables managers to devise strategies accordingly in this new age of social commerce. To this end, data has been collected from three countriesâ€”Italy, Pakistan, and Australiaâ€”in order to have a diverse perspective on consumers around the world. The data comes from consumers who participate in social commerce and whose shopping decisions are influenced by Facebook. As social commerce is a rather new and unstructured phenomenon, this dissertation focused on the consumers' perspective and the most popular social networking site, Facebook, thus providing a baseline theoretical model of further research with different categories, target audiences, and constructs.
The importance of developing volunteer human resource management practices in order to improve volunteer retention in community sport organisations is well documented. Increasingly however stakeholders are beginning to realise that the application of traditional management practices within community sport organisations may have only limited success due to inherent differences in the structures, culture, processes and working environments of such organisations to their commerical counterparts. All existing studies have however focused on mainstream, locally popular sports and none have been conducted within the Nordic countries. This study sought to address this gap in the literature by identifying current volunteer human resource management practices within mainstream but not locally popular community sport organisations within the Nordics, and to examine the efficacy of these practices in terms of perceived volunteer retention. Participants were 141 board-level representatives of clubs and federations from the sports of American football, Australian rules football, baseball, cricket, and rugby union in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each completed an online survey that identified existing volunteer management practices and assessed perceived issues associated with volunteer retention. The results indicated that the more extensively community sport organisations adopted volunteer management practices, the less perceived problems of volunteer retention were an issue. The application of planning practices in particular were a significant predictor of general perceived problems of volunteer retention and for the retention of board members in particular. The implications for all stakeholders within Nordic community sport are discussed, with specific recommendations that more widespread implementation of planning practices be considered as part of any new model of volunteer management.

"Traditionally, organizations have hired employees based on what they can do and have done in the past (competency-based recruiting), rather than what they are naturally good at and love doing, or Strengths-Based Recruitment (SBR). Companies, such as Starbucks and Gap, have adopted SBR and have reported increases in productivity and customer satisfaction and decreases in sick days. Through case studies and interviews with executive board level leaders, Strengths-Based Recruitment and Development takes a more strategic look at developing SBR and provides valuable insight into how SBR has been successfully implemented in organizations to improve performance and the bottom line. It goes beyond simply recruiting the right people, to keeping employees working at their best through development and performance management, and creating a culture that brings out their strengths. Chapters explain the differences between SBR and competency-based recruiting, the benefits of using SBR, how SBR works in practice, how to implement an SBR strategy while avoiding pitfalls, the financial and human impact of an effective strengths-based strategy, and finally, discuss strengths-based performance management and development"--
