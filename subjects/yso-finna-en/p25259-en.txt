The venture capital industry in the USA, Europe and Finland : development, environment and incentives
From relational capital to venture capital : financing entrepreneurial international new ventures
"The completion of a successful venture capital transaction requires the deal to progress through a multi-stage process. Guiding this progression is no easy task for venture capitalists, as they face a number of challenges related to their external and internal environments. In the external environment, venture capitalists must interact with the entrepreneurs and assume a myriad of roles - coach, educator, partner, negotiator, etc. In the internal environment, venture capitalists must ensure that deals pass the scrutiny of colleagues in the fund and go through three communication channels. The book provides one of the most comprehensive overviews of the inner mechanics of processing venture capital deals from the fund manager's perspective. The venture capital process is captured in an 8-stage investment model"--Provided by publisher.

The crowdfunding revolution : how to raise venture capital using social media
The purpose of this study is to explore the role of relational capital in raising and utilizing venture capital by international new ventures (INVs). This study reviews literature on INVs, venture capital, and social capital theory and defines relational capital as the level of trust developed in the course of interactions between INVs and venture capital firms (VC firms) that leads to positive venture capital decisions and value creation.This empirical study of relational capital formation and utilization is accomplished by the case study method. The study is based on interviews with five case INVs regarding entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists (VCs)' experiences with forming and utilizing relational capital for the purpose of new venture internationalization. This study approaches the relationship between INV and VC firm from the relational capital perspective, exploring how INVs can raise venture capital for internationalization as well as how they can use relational capital to improve outcomes of new venture internationalization after venture capital is allocated. The analysis identifies the factors that affect formation of relational capital between INVs and VC firms, the outcomes that result from relational capital formed in the pre-investment stage, and the impact on performance of INVs during post-investment collaboration.This study develops a conceptual model proposing that the financing process for entrepreneurial INVs consists of forming and using relational capital to obtain venture capital investment. The particular characteristics of the INVs and VC firms, as well as behavior-related factors, have been found to be important to forming relational capital between INVs and VC firms. The relational capital formation process creates an atmosphere in which entrepreneurs and VCs provide both tangible and intangible resources to support INV internationalization. This study adds the relational capital viewpoint to the literature pertaining to venture capital and INVs by analyzing the role of relational capital in financing entrepreneurial INVs. Regarding managerial implications, the study shows how entrepreneurs can influence the venture capital investment process, where VC firms should pay attention to while working with INVs, and how policy makers could contribute by providing a positive environment for INV and VC firm collaboration.
