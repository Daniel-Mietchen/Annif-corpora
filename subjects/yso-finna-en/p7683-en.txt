Abstract.
Usher and you : Usher syndrome in the deaf community
A questionnaire survey of education provision for hearing impaired children has identified the existence of 54 pupils who are diagnosed as having Usher Syndrome. Pupils with Usher Syndrome have congenital hearing loss and an additional degenerative eye condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which is characterized by progressive night blindness and tunnel vision. While most of the identified pupils are in their mid to late teens, three pupils have been identified at the age of 7 years or below. The survey reveals a large proportion of teachers who are seeking information, guidance and support in their work with these children. It highlights the need for earlier identification, and for the development of expertise in educational management of pupils with Usher Syndrome.
