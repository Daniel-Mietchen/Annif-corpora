The thesis investigates the opportunitites that business-to-business companies have in the social media market and to facilitate an understanding of the LinkedIn environment. The objective is to create a manual supporting Nets, a company in the IT industry, to enter the social media environment through LinkedIn. The thesis consists of six parts; introduction, history of social networking sites, social media marketing, case company analysis, benchmarking and strategic planning. The benchmarking process is done through desk research, by collecting information about competitors' and non-competitors' company pages on LinkedIn. The research started in June 2013 and was completed in October 2013. The findings reveal best-in-class-examples such as videos supporting employer branding, nicheing content to reach the target groups and failures such as use of non-relevant videos, sales pitches glorifying the company and low quality graphics. The results of the benchmarking and strategic analysis are used as the basis for the LinkedIn handbook, to support the internal social media processes and create a common understanding of how to use LinkedIn for the case company.
