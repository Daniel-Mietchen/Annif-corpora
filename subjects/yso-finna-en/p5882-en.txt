Clank! : a deck-building adventure
Brief report : The presence of conspicuous associates protects nesting Redshank Tringa totanus from aerial predators
Burgle your way to adventure in Clank!, the new deck-building board game. Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.  Be quick and be quiet. One false-step and -- CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can only enjoy your plunder if you make it out of the depths alive!

This document contains the report of the Expert Consultation on International Guidelines for Bycatch Management and Reduction of Discards held in Rome, Italy, from 30 November to 3 December 2009. The Expert Consultation was convened to review an initial draft of the International Guidelines as called for by the FAO Committee on Fisheries at its twenty-eighth session in 2009. The Expert Consultation adopted a draft text containing International Guidelines to be forwarded on to a technical Consultation for review and finalization. The Expert Consultation based its work on a preliminary text prepared by FAO. The Expert Consultation was hosted by FAO and funded by the Government of Norway and the FAO Regular Programme.
