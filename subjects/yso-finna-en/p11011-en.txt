"Evaluation and Management of Common Upper Extremity Disorders: A Practical Handbook answers the need for a comprehensive, yet concise reference that addresses practical solutions to everyday conditions that general orthopedic surgeons, and specialists alike, as well those involved with general musculoskeletal surgical and nonsurgical care, may encounter. This book provides information on how to diagnose, treat, and manage the most commonly encountered conditions of the upper extremity. Written in a bullet format, and including photos for quick, easy reference, the book contains valuable information for all levels of training and experience"--Provided by publisher.
