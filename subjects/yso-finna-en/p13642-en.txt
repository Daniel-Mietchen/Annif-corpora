Sales channel strategy for domestic and international expansion : case: Company Z
This thesis was made as a case study for a Finnish company that operates internationally around the world. The company produces various paper products. The objective of the thesis was to find out successful ways of marketing and branding bulk products. Moreover, the thesis represents four successful cases of bulky product branding strategies and benchmarks to them. Bulk products, or in other words commodities, are products that are often traded in bulk amounts and produced worldwide by several different producers (see specific definitions of the most used words in glossary). This thesis was conducted as a desktop study. To achieve the desired outcome, the theory was structured by finding information from both literally and from Internet sources. The theory has been examined from multiple sources and viewpoints and brought into practice by benchmarking to four successful case studies. The case studies represent four real-life cases of commodity marketing: wine, toilet paper, water and coffee. Afterwards a cross-case analysis represents the main points that lead the companies or brands to success. According to the benchmarked cases, humor in branding, design, exclusiveness and cooperation with partners are the factors that make commodity marketing successful. The results state, that commodity products can be marketed and branded in a relatively similar way, as normal goods. The final part of the thesis represents concrete suggestions on how the case company could proceed in order to reach their goals. The suggestions cover humor usage, cooperation with partners (such as famous designers, bakeries, catering companies), focus on packaging and layout. The main findings of the study show that there is an enormous amount of information available and unfortunately, a clear path cannot be found. Commodity marketing, as marketing itself is a wide topic and every brand needs to find their own way of doing it, in order to differentiate from the others and be successful. The provided results are seen to be practical and give some ideas for the case company.

In Making Things Better, A. David Napier demonstrates how anthropological description of non-Western exchange practices and beliefs can be a tonic for contemporary economic systems in which our impersonal relationship to "things" transforms the animate elements of social life into inanimate sets of commodities. Such a fundamental transformation, Napier suggests, makes us automatons in globally integrated social circuits that generate a cast of a winners and losers engaged in hostile competition for wealth and power. Our impersonal relations to "things"-and to people as well-are so ingrained in our being, we take them for granted as we sleepwalk through routine life. Like the surrealist artists of the 1920s who, through their art, poetry, films, and photography, fought a valiant battle against mind-numbing conformity, Napier provides exercises and practica designed to shock the reader from their wakeful sleep. These demonstrate powerfully the positively integrative social effects of more socially entangled, non-Western orientations to "things" and to "people." His arguments also have implications for the rights and legal status of indigenous peoples, which are drawn out in the course of the book.
