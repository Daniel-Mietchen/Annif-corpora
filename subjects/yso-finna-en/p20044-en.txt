In this presentation the possibilities to improve  facility management by monitoring is introduced  based on case studies on the district-level operation  center of the city of Kuopio and Aalto University  Otaniemi - campus area in the city of Espoo. Also  guidance options of public authorities are introduced  the advanced role of BSO (Building Supervision  Office), city of Oulu, Finland as example. In the  presentation the attention is paid also how one can  convert from the big mass of data the useful  information for stakeholders.

Architects and engineers found distinct voices for themselves in the ensuing uproar. Rondelet emerged, not quite the victor, but the man commissioned to ensure structural stability." "This book, the first devoted to Rondelet, tells the story of the most celebrated architectural debate of the century. It also examines Rondetlet's career in full, his publications and his long lasting influence on the training of architects and the administration of architectural practice in France. More than any other architect Rondelet represents the era of change during which the foundations for modern architectural theory and practice were laid."--BOOK JACKET.

Packed with case studies highlighting construction companies that regularly recycle between 70% and 95% of concrete from their waste streams, this book presents practical, up-to-date information about concrete's history in the green building movement, state of the art methodologies, and current best practices. Using the USGBC LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building assessment standard, the book covers site, energy, water, materials, indoor environmental quality, construction, and demolition waste protocols and provides information on tracking the LEED requirements to assure timely building certification. It also addresses non-LEED issues, such as flo od and fire protection benefits.

Providing the most recent information about concrete's history in the green building movement, state-of-the-art methodologies and best practices, this book may be considered a textbook for university courses and industry education; a handbook to help building owners obtain green certification; a reference for industry professionals seeking an overview of the subject of concrete and green buildings; and as a guide to professionals in the building materials/products industries. The concept of green buildings is in the process of emerging from a decade long effort to define itself, and this book offers an overview of all of the available information.

"Horyu-ji temple was first erected in the 7th century and has come down to us today in the magnificent form it achieved in 711, over 1,300 years ago. It has given lie to the common misconception that wood is destined to quickly rot and decay, and has demonstrated the enduring value of wood, not to mention the fact that the temple has been designated a World Heritage Site as the earth's oldest wooden structure. Here Tsunekazu Nishioka, the master carpenter who undertook the repair of this monumental structure in the mid 20th century, shares the insights and knowledge he gained from that experience. To make Nishioka's words and observations more easily understood by later generations, Jiro Kohara has buttressed them with scientific experiments and commentary, bringing into sharp view Hory-ji's long-concealed mysteries and secrets. The result is a revealing picture of Japan's immemorial love of trees and wood, a broad-ranging introduction to the country's wood culture." from back cover.

"Though engineers, architects and even landscape designers had staked out fields of operation for themselves in the seventeenth century such professions were in flux well into the eighteenth century. The same man might still operate in all of these fields. But by the middle of the century professional boundaries were becoming clearer. Jean Rondelet took up his career in 1770, working for Jacques-Germain Soufflot, architect of the most conspicuous and structurally daring church of the period, Sainte-Genevieve, now known as the Pantheon, in Paris. Rondelet assumed the role of technical expert, taking on more and more control not only of the structural design but of the site organisation as well. And he was to dedicate his life to these tasks. For the church became a focus of structural debate that became increasingly partisan and acrimonious when faults in the structure threatened a total collapse of the dome.

The following resume study deals with building material, which together with construction and structures, forms one of the three aspects of building, or equally one of the three factors which constitute the nature of a building. Unlike existing manuals on ancient building, this offers an analytic presentation and the subject matter extends across all ages and regions. The treatment of materials is set out according to a paradigm of nature, manufacture and use, so as to facilitate direct comparison between different modes of the one material, as also between different materials and between different building traditions.
