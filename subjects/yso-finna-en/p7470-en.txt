Health care in the U.S. : equitable for whom?
"The leading figure in qualitative health research (QHR), Janice M. Morse, asserts that QHR is its own separate discipline--distinct from both traditional health research and other kinds of qualitative research and examines the implications of this position for theory, research, and practice. She contends that the health care environments transform many of the traditional norms of qualitative research and shape a new and different kind of research tradition. Similarly, the humanizing ethos of qualitative health research has much to teach traditional researchers and practitioners in health disciplines. She explores how the discipline of QHR can play out in practice, both in the clinic and in the classroom, in North America and around the world. A challenging, thought-provoking call to rethink how to conduct qualitative research in health settings".

There is a lack of studies on the association between labour force participation and abortion. This study examined how the likelihood of having an abortion depends on being employed, unemployed, student or outside the workforce using Finnish register data from three birth cohorts (born in 1955-59, 1965-69 and 1975-79) of nearly 260,000 women. The results differed depending on whether all women or only pregnant women were studied and on the cohort analysed. Unemployed women had a high likelihood of abortion when all women were studied, but among pregnant women students had the highest likelihood. The direction and strength of the association varied by relationship status, age, and parity. The results show that the likelihood of abortion depends on women's economic position. More studies on contraceptive use and pregnancy intentions in Finland are needed to identify the mechanisms behind these findings.

Women's Health Matters, like its sister volume Women's Health Counts, is an invaluable practical guide to doing feminist research on women's health. Written by experienced researchers and practitioners, these lively accounts of research work range from getting the research idea, through obtaining the funding and doing the research, to the practical problems faced, and eventual publication. The book provides an ideal antidote to textbooks and manuals, giving the reader a taste of the problems and pleasures of doing real research.

Health and functional capacity in Finland : baseline results of the Health 2000 health examination survey
Latvia has been suffering a substantial decrease in population since the early 1990s. There appears to have been little or no detailed analysis of the genesis of this decline in population. The major political event occurring at the beginning of the population decline was the rapid transitioning from socialism to capitalism. This study has revealed the causes of severe population decline to be a combination of steadily-declining birth rate, sharply rising high death rate, and mass emigration of people to wealthier European states. The cross-over of birth rate and death rate could be attributed to the tumultuous societal upheavals in the changeover from the socialistic protective-welfare system to a free-market capitalistic economic system. In particular, this traumatic event had probably affected the physical and mental health of many people to result in premature deaths from, among other things, consequential morbidity, accidents, homicides and suicides. Practicable remedies to arrest the continuing trend of precipitous decline in the population might include a) repairing the failures of the current modality of national health care, b) creating higher paying jobs in Latvia to entice prospective young emigrants to stay in Latvia, and c) repatriating of recent Latvian émigrés.

All the five Nordic countries have a long tradition in health statistics and health monitoring. The cornerstone of the national health information systems is register information. There are, for example, complete population-based registration of births and deaths, cancers, hospital care, and medication (Cappelen and Lysol 2004, Gissler and Haukka. 2004, Mortensen 2004, Otterblad Olausson et al. 2004). The main prerequisites for a functioning register system are its completeness and high quality. These are facilitated by the Nordic legislation allowing mandatory reporting from public and private sector without informed consent and the existence of unique person identity number system. .
