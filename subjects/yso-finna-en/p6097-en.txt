"This practical guide to biosimulation provides the hands-on experience needed to devise, design and analyze simulations of biophysical processes for applications in biological and biomedical sciences. Through real-world case studies and worked examples, students will develop and apply basic operations through to advanced concepts, covering a wide range of biophysical topics including chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and cellular electrophysiology. Each chapter is built around case studies in a given application area, with simulations of real biological systems developed to analyze and interpret data. Open-ended project-based exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, and with all data and computer codes available online (www.cambridge.org/biosim) students can quickly and easily run, manipulate, explore and expand on the examples inside. This hands-on guide is ideal for use on senior undergraduate/graduate courses and also as a self-study guide for anyone who needs to develop computational models of biological systems".

Biophysical journal
Physics for Biology and Medicine, 4e, covers topics in physics as they apply to the life sciences, specifically medicine, physiology, nursing and other applied health fields. This concise introductory paperback surveys and relates basic physics to living systems. It discusses biological systems that can be analyzed quantitatively and how advances in the life sciences have been aided by the knowledge of physical or engineering analysis techniques. Applicable courses are biophysics and applied physics. Provides practical techniques for applying knowledge of physics to the study of living systemsPresents material in a straight forward manner requiring very little background in physics or biologyIncludes many figures, examples and illustrative problems and appendices which provide convenient access to the most important concepts of mechanics, electricity, and optics.
