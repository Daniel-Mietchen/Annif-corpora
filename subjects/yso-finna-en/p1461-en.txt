High performance gymnastics
I love gymnastics
The book “High Performance Gymnastics” is a state-of-the-art documentation of sport science research in artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, coming from a collaboration between Brazil and Germany, and referring to the III. SIGARC congress, hosted 2012 in Sao Paulo (Brazil). International renowned authors provide in-detail discussions in the fields of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics. Psychological topics, such as the role of the coach in gymnastics or athletes’ perceptions towards gymnastics are discussed, as well as topics from biomechanics, training science, or history.
Techniques and skills for bars, floor, balance beam and vault are presented by skill level rather than by age groups and are applicable to both boys and girls where appropriate. With content aimed at developing the entire coach, beyond just skills and drills, Coaching Youth Gymnastics will help you to create an environment that promotes learning, enjoyment, safety and motivation for youth gymnasts.
