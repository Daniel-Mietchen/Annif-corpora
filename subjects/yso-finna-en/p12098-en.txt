Day-by-day with Billy Graham : a devotional book
An important collection of essays focused how the climactic episode of Christian scripture and apocrypha, the life of Christ, was repeatedly adapted for a variety of audiences and devotional uses in the Middle Ages. Christ's life, as related through the Gospel narratives and early Apocrypha, was subject to a riot of literary-devotional adaptation in the medieval period. This collection provides a series of groundbreaking studies centring on the devotional and cultural significance of Christianity's pivotal story during the Middle Ages. The collection represents an important milestone in terms of mapping the meditative modes of piety that characterize a number of Christological traditions, including the Meditationes vitae Christi and the numerous versions it spawned in both Latin and the vernacular. A number of chapters in the volume track how and why meditative piety grew in popularity to become a mode of spiritual activity advised not only to recluses and cenobites as in the writings of Aelred of Rievaulx, but also reached out to diverse lay audiences through the pastoral regimens prescribed by devotional authors such as the Carthusian prior Nicholas Love in England and the Parisian theologian and chancellor of the University of Paris, Jean Gerson. Through exploring these texts from a variety of perspectives — theoretical, codicological, theological — and through tracing their complex lines of dissemination in ideological and material terms, this collection promises to be invaluable to students and scholars of medieval religious and literary culture.
Prayers written at Vailima
Franciscan literature of religious instruction before the Council of Trent
The bibliography of the Book of common prayer, 1549-1999
This volume presents for the first time a Middle English Life of Christ, with additional religious advice, written in the early fifteenth century by a Carthusian monk at the Sheen Charterhouse for a nun at the nearby Bridgettine Syon Abbey. Both the Sheen Charterhouse and Syon were recent royal foundations, established by Henry V. The Mirror is an important example of the devotional works produced to satisfy demand among laity as well as professed religious, wanting to read lives of Christ in the years following the repressive legislation of Archbishop Arundel (1409), which placed severe restrictions on biblical translation into English, intended to limit the spread of heresy. The Mirror, written in the tradition of the highly successful translation by another Carthusian, Nicholas Love, of Pseudo-Bonaventure's life of Christ, testifies to the demand for such material in pious households.
Mother Teresa : a simple path
While many of us are familiar with such famous words as, "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here." or "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust," we may not know that they originated with The Book of Common Prayer, which first appeared in 1549. Like the words of the King James Bible and Shakespeare, the language of this prayer book has saturated English culture and letters. Here Alan Jacobs tells its story. Jacobs shows how The Book of Common Prayer--from its beginnings as a means of social and political control in the England of Henry VIII to its worldwide presence today--became a venerable work whose cadences express the heart of religious life for many.The book's chief maker, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, created it as the authoritative manual of Christian worship throughout England. But as Jacobs recounts, the book has had a variable and dramatic career in the complicated history of English church politics, and has been the focus of celebrations, protests, and even jail terms. As time passed, new forms of the book were made to suit the many English-speaking nations: first in Scotland, then in the new United States, and eventually wherever the British Empire extended its arm. Over time, Cranmer's book was adapted for different preferences and purposes. Jacobs vividly demonstrates how one book became many--and how it has shaped the devotional lives of men and women across the globe.

A catalog of British devotional and religious books in German translation from the Reformation to 1750
"The Doctrine of the Hert" was the fifteenth-century English translation of "De doctrina cordis", the thirteenth-century Latin devotional treatise addressed to nuns. The text progressively pairs the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit with seven key actions of the heart, leading readers toward contemplative unity with God. The text was a religious bestseller. It circulated widely throughout Europe between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries and was translated into numerous vernacular versions. This book consists of ten essays from an international group of scholars of medieval religion discussing the Middle English text alongside its Latin forebear, and other European vernacular translations (French, German, Spanish and Middle Dutch). Despite its medieval popularity, "The Doctrine of the Hert" has largely escaped the attention of scholars until recently. Yet it has much to offer regarding our understanding of late medieval female spirituality. University of Exeter Press' new edition (published June 2009) opens up the field by providing access to the text, and this companion further establishes scholarship on this text.
