"This second edition provides guidance on all aspects of how to make and use antibodies for research, and commercial and industrial applications. All chapters are revised, updated, or expanded. New material in the book includes western blotting, aptamers, antibodies as therapeutics, quantitative production, and humanization of antibodies. The authors present descriptions of basic methods for making and using antibodies and describe basic laboratory techniques in detail. Each chapter includes introductory material, allowing for a better understanding of each concept. Practical examples are also included"--Provided by publisher.

"The focus of Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, will be unchanged from the original edition by Ed Harlow and David Lane and will cover both the production and use of antibodies in a way that is accessible to the nonimmunologist. The emphasis will be on contemporary, essential antibody-based methods that are tried, true, necessary, and useful to a broad population of life scientists. The manual will provide up-to-date protocols that work reproducibly, along with explanations as to how and why methods work and how to choose between alternative approaches. Methods that have become research staples since the manual was originally published will be included at the same level of detail and organization as the existing topics"--

"In this volume, the authors provide an excellent overview of how far the plant viral vector field has come. This discipline is no longer exclusively the domain of academics - there is a small, but growing number of small biotechnology companies that exploit plant viruses as a platform for commercial innovation in crop improvement, industrial product manufacturing, and human and veterinary health care. The authors, who work in the plant viral 'vectorology' field, have Bill Dawson to thank in some way for their scientific pedigree, and they are honored that he contributed the opening chapter of this volume with the history of plant virus vector development: 'A vector is not a virus; it is a device designed to perform a specific function.' Other contributors have provided fascinating reviews of how plant viral vectors have been adapted to serve specific functions, from plant gene function discovery to nanotechnology, providing infinitely scalable manufacturing systems valuable for human therapeutics." -- (Back Cover)

This volume provides a state-of-the-art update on Fc Receptors (FcRs). It is divided into five parts. Part I, Old and New FcRs, deals with the long-sought-after FcμR and the recently discovered FCRL family and TRIM21. Part II, FcR Signaling, presents a computational model of FcRI signaling, novel calcium channels, and the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. Part III, FcR Biology, addresses major physiological functions of FcRs, their glycosylation, how they induce and regulate both adaptive immune responses and inflammation, especially in vivo, FcR humanized mice, and the multifaceted properties of FcRn. Part IV, FcRs and Disease, discusses FcR polymorphism, FcRs in rheumatoid arthritis and whether their FcRs make macaques good models for studying HIV infection. In Part V, FcRs and Therapeutic Antibodies, the roles of various FcRs, including FcRIIB and FcRI, in the immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases using monoclonal antibodies and IVIg are highlighted. All 18 chapters were written by respected experts in their fields, offering an invaluable reference source for scientists and clinicians interested in FcRs and how to better master antibodies for therapeutic purposes.
