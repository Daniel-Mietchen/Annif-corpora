The essence of technical communication for engineers : writing, presentation, and meeting skills
"This book is designed to prepare students in the applied sciences and engineering for both analytic and numerical solutions of problems arising in post-graduate studies and in industrial practice. It includes examples and problems from biology, chemistry, and physics, as well as from most engineering disciplines and the presentation accommodates the learning styles of contemporary students"--

East-west cooperation in continuing engineering education
"The first edition of Caroline Whitbeck's Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research focused on the difficult ethical problems engineers encounter in their practice and in research. In many ways, these problems are like design problems: they are complex, often ill defined; resolving them involves an iterative process of analysis and synthesis; and there can be more than one acceptable solution. In the second edition of this text, Dr. Whitbeck goes above and beyond by featuring more real-life problems, stating recent scenarios, and laying the foundation of ethical concepts and reasoning. This book offers a real-world, problem-centered approach to engineering ethics, using a rich collection of open-ended case studies to develop skill in recognizing and addressing ethical issues"--Provided by publisher.

Better scientific and technical writing
Most undergraduate books for engineering dynamics exhibit a continuing disconnect from either the requirements of subsequent coursework or the practice of dynamics in an engineering career. Dynamics in Engineering Practice, Tenth Edition counters this dated viewpoint with a modern approach that is better suited to today's engineering study and practice. The books begins by establishing the premise that most "dynamics engineers" are developing and analyzing models to predict motion, and that the subject of differential equations is the natural language for dynamics. From this starting point, the author immediately presents mechanical vibration examples to demonstrate applications of f=ma and work-energy principles, and he includes multiple "real-world" 1DOF and MDOF planar dynamics examples, which are completely worked out.

Based on the author's more than 40 years of experience teaching and developing course in dynamics, this book shows readers how to develop models for dynamic and vibration systems, and analyze the resultant models. It teaches general skills---where effectiveness can be demonstrated for a wide range of problems, rather than a collection of problem-specific "tricks." An essential resource at both the academic and professional levels, this text is indispensable for students, as well as working engineers analyzing real dynamic systems.
