"An examination of how language functions in CLIL, based on a corpus of classroom interactions. Drawing on their wide experience as CLIL educators and researchers, the authors explore data collected in real CLIL classrooms from two interrelated perspectives: the CLIL classroom as an interactional context for developing language and content, and the genres and registers through which the meanings of the different academic subjects are enacted. From the analysis of this corpus of data, the authors provide a rich description of how CLIL students' language works and may be expected to develop. Also available separately as a paperback"--

Cultural diversity and its impact on education
"CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) has emerged since the millennium as a major trend in education. Written by Do Coyle, Philip Hood and David Marsh and drawing on their experience of CLIL in secondary schools, primary schools and English language schools across Europe, this book gives a comprehensive overview of CLIL. It summarizes the theory which underpins the teaching of a content subject through another language and discusses its practical application, outlining the key directions for the development of research and practice. This book acknowledges the uncertainty many teachers feel about CLIL, because of the requirement for both language and subject knowledge, while providing theoretical and practical routes towards successful practice for all"--Provided by publisher.

"How does a bilingual acquire, comprehend, produce, and control multiple languages in one mind? What are some of the cognitive and neurocognitive consequences of being a bilingual? These are just a few of the intriguing theoretical questions at the core of studying bilingualism from psycholinguistic and neurocognitive perspectives. For decades, researchers have been intrigued by how the human mind processes multiple languages. With intensified research efforts have come insightful inquiries, pioneering theories, and implications for future research. Perhaps an example is one the earliest and most studied questions related to psycholinguistic perspectives of bilingualism: Whether humans have a separate or shared (whether fully- or partially-shared) system for the representation and cognitive processing of multiple languages (Kolers, 1963; McCormack, 1977; Weinreich, 1953). Although much progress has been made, this question will continue to be one of many topics of interest in this handbook"--

"How does a human acquire, comprehend, produce and control multiple languages with just the power of one mind? What are the cognitive consequences of being a bilingual? These are just a few of the intriguing questions at the core of studying bilingualism from psycholinguistic and neurocognitive perspectives. Bringing together some of the world's leading experts in bilingualism, cognitive psychology and language acquisition, The Cambridge Handbook of Bilingual Processing explores these questions by presenting a clear overview of current theories and findings in bilingual processing. This comprehensive handbook is organized around overarching thematic areas including theories and methodologies, acquisition and development, comprehension and representation, production, control, and the cognitive consequences of bilingualism. The handbook serves as an informative overview for researchers interested in cognitive bilingualism and the logic of theoretical and experimental approaches to language science. It also functions as an instrumental source of readings for anyone interested in bilingual processing"--
