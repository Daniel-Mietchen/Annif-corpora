Summary.
This timely, concise title provides an important update on clinical lipid management. Using information from recent clinical trials and in special populations, the book begins by offering an easy-to-read overview of LDL, HDL, and triglyceride metabolism and the genetics of lipid disorders. The link between inflammation and lipids, and how this relates to atherosclerosis development, is also addressed, as are the measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with abnormal lipid levels. Lipid abnormalities in children, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations (with an emphasis on ethnicity and childhood obesity), are covered. The treatment goals and approaches for managing lipids in the clinic are thoroughly discussed, emphasizing the important role of statin use and addressing controversies of lipid management in special populations such as heart failure, end stage kidney disease and fatty liver disease. Of special note, an important update on how new HIV medications impact lipid levels is provided. In all, Lipid Management: From Basics to Clinic, is an invaluable, handy resource for understanding changes in lipids in different populations and for sharpening the clinical approach to managing complicated lipid cases.

Comprising contributions from leading lipidologists from around the world, this book presents the latest and most comprehensive knowledge on the different options for combination therapy of dyslipidemia, and includes discussion of future therapies that are currently in late stages of clinical evaluation. Dyslipidemia is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and most patients with this condition fail to achieve adequate control of their serum lipid levels with monotherapy. However, recent US and European guideline recommendations, based on randomized, controlled trials, fail to discuss combination therapy options for patients with dyslipidemia. Statins remain the mainstay of drug therapy for hyperlipidemia and chapters in this book specifically examine the role of add-on therapy with different agents modulating the different lipid fractions in the blood, e.g. bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils), inhibitors of Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein B-100 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), and the emerging proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. There is additional discussion of the role of non-drug therapy options such as nutraceuticals, functional foods and lipoprotein apheresis. The book also discusses the combination of antihypertensive drugs with lipid-lowering drugs in the management of cardiovascular risk in patents with dyslipidemia.
