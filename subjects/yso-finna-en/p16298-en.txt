Staying or leaving the course : non-completion and retention of mature students in further and higher education
Research Methods in Practice provides an innovative, state-of-the-art introduction to research and analytical methods for postgraduate students. The coverage of the methods and concepts of contemporary research allow researchers and non-researchers alike to truly grasp the logic, and limits, of modern research as it appears in academic journals, government reports, and in the daily news. The textbook emphasizes the critical interpretation and practical application of research findings, and covers many cutting-edge issues and methods not found in other books, including: a more in-depth, contemporary focus on causation; the logic and use of control variables with non-experimental data; the use of visual path diagrams to better understand both causation and the use of control variables; a fuller, more innovative treatment of quasi and natural experiments; a focus on data collection for performance measurement; a discussion of cutting-edge issues in sampling and survey research (such as the response rate problem in telephone surveys and the emergence of new methods for online surveys); and, an integrated treatment of qualitative methods that appears throughout the book and emphasizes the integration of qualitative with quantitative methods.

Summary report on doctoral experience in UniOGS graduate school at the University of Oulu
Learning transitions in higher education
This report is part of the research-based development of doctoral training in the UniOGS graduate school, at the University of Oulu. It aims to contribute research-based evidence pertaining to the development of doctoral education in the UniOGS graduate school at the University of Oulu by exploring the doctoral experience in the UniOGS, and the primary regulators of the doctoral journey. The data reported here were collected with the doctoral experience survey from doctoral students of UniOGS graduate school. Doctoral students’ experiences of doctoral training were analysed in terms of three complementary aspects of the training: the doctoral dissertation process, supervision, and doctoral studies. The report consists of a summary of the results based on data collected from doctoral students at the University of Oulu in April 2015.
