This thesis was commissioned by SYMBIO, the learning forum for the HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences and companies. The guideline was to study and benchmark food tourism services, due to the fact that currently there are few food tourism services in Porvoo. The objective of this thesis is to illuminate the relatively new concept of food tourism and to study the current state of food tourism in the city. The purpose was to explore the aptitude and willingness of entrepreneurs to develop this concept in Porvoo. The theoretical framework is based on the definition of food tourism as well as means for developing it. The thesis has a developmental orientation. Benchmarking is employed for finding examples from other instances that have successfully developed food tourism at their destinations. The approach of the study was qualitative. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews in five companies in Porvoo and by means of one open interview and one e-mail interview. All of the companies work with food and/or tourism. The interviews were conducted between March 2009 and November 2009.    The results indicate that there are few food tourism products in Porvoo yet, however, the entrepreneurs are interested in this phenomenon and regard Porvoo as a city with a lot of potential. The results suggest that if there were a leader in charge of the developing process, entrepreneurs would consider taking part in it. Accordingly, Porvoo Tours is perceived as the most potential leader. Moreover, the importance of co-operation was emphasized. Premium Visit -network is seen as a beneficial network and an important tool in developing food tourism in Porvoo. Finally, the rich history and locality pride are seen as the biggest assets. In conclusion, the study reveals new perspectives of developing tourism in Porvoo. The city has a lot to offer. The results can be used in the future if further development of food tourism is launched in the city. More research is still required due to the unexplored nature of the topic.

This thesis provides an introduction to XML indexes of DB2 pureXML Feature Pack, evaluating the effect of XML indexes to performance of application queries. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part, chapters 1-4, present an overview of the “Transaction Processing over XML” (TPoX) benchmark and introduction to the implementation of XML indexes in DB2 9 LUW, based on literature research in handbooks, case studies and manuals. The smallest configured TPoX benchmark environment (XS scaling with 3 620 833 XML documents in 10GB disc size) is installed on Windows XP platform in a Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 computer. The second part, the empirical part in chapter 5, presents series of tests using selected XQuery queries of TPoX in the generated XS environment, with and without the XML indexes on XML columns. The use of indexes is studied from the extended EXPLAIN tables of hybrid DB2 giving performance estimates in TIMERON units of DB2. The performance effect is measured in the corresponding TPoX test runs of 25...100 concurrent virtual users. According to the empirical tests, the XML indexes have a remarkable impact on the query performance and it proved to be effective to TPoX benchmark performance. The study concludes that, the indexes on XML columns have a significant effect on the query performance in TPoX benchmark. Moreover, how to build up the indexes on XML column is also a highly considerable issue.

The thesis studies recruitment and centralised recruitment. The aim of the study is to investigate what type of recruitment process models or process model parts Kesko Group should apply and why. Kesko Group's Corporate HR is currently studying different recruitment model options in order to develop their recruitment model which at the moment is decentralised. Kesko Group's development need leans toward centralised recruitment but also decentralised processes and process models are being considered. The theoretical framework focuses on describing a recruitment process in general and concepts related to centralised recruitment, such as outsourcing, HR service centres and recruitment quality measures. The aspect of employer branding and its connection to recruitment are also discussed. Moreover, the study aims to take into consideration other research related to the field of recruitment, such as the influence of the economy on recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the service industry. The framework was built by studying human resource and recruitment literature and existing recruitment research. The empirical study was conducted in qualitative research by interviewing corporate recruitment managers at ISS Services and Itella Corporation. The interviews were face- to face interviews in which the interviewees answered open- ended questions sent to them before hand. The interview results indicated that both companies that, similar to Kesko Group, recruit mostly customer service personnel have some level of centralised recruitment. The conducted study supports Kesko Corporation's plans to develop Kesko Group's recruitment by centralising recruitment operations. Based on the research Kesko Corporation should consider implementing a centralised recruitment model or recruitment model parts managed by non outsourced recruitment consultants. This would support ensuring the acquirement of professional workforce in a cost efficient manner that would also support employer branding.

The objective of the study is to explore the problem of marketing of contract based services in industrial B-to-B sector with a primary focus on the promotional part of the marketing mix. One intention is to research the marketing communication actions of the case company, as well as promotional activities of comparable contract services of other B-to-B companies. Another intention is to recommend how marketing communication actions for contract-based services could be improved in the case company to support sales activities of local ABBs units. The theoretical framework was based on the studies of contemporary marketing and service marketing theorists like Kotler, P., Grönroos, C., Jobber, D., Lovelock, C. and others. Also scientific articles of industrial services researchers Kumar, R. and Kumar, U. were used in the study. Industrial firms increasingly demand turnkey solutions and are willing to cooperate with a specific supplier in a single source relationship. For marketing communication activities of contract based services it is important to understand specific features of product offering, to understand customers' needs and buying behavior, and to make the right decisions on the marketing communication mix. The study was carried out in the form of qualitative research. Data was gathered through interviews with service sales managers from five European countries and service product managers from the global service business unit. The company's internal databases and public Internet pages served as a basis for a benchmark analysis. The results showed that on the European market needs of industrial customers located in different countries are very similar.  In communication of service contract the main message should carry the idea of providing customers with a feeling of security and the possibility to concentrate on the customer's core business. The results also suggested that the most common and effective way to sell contract-based services is face-to-face sales. Brochures, presentations, leaflets serve as additional tools for sales people to promote a service contract. To achieve other marketing promotional objectives, like increased service product awareness, customers' involvement, and built relationships with a community, other communication activities should be taken. Here digital marketing can be integrated into the traditional marketing communication mix. In order to respect the company's business secrets, chapters containing internal company's data and the improvement proposals on how to enhance the current marketing communication actions for service contracts in ABB are not included in the public version of the thesis.

International virtual teamwork offers new opportunities for the professional development of teachers. In this paper, we examine the initial experiences in an ongoing international virtual benchmarking project coordinated by the Finnish Online University of Applied Sciences. What challenges does an international context present for project construction and collaboration? Data from five countries, in the form of participant reflections and researchers' observations, were analysed according to four types of barriers: language, time, technical and mental barriers. Initial data indicates that trust is an essential starting point, as there is neither time nor possibilities to build mutual trust by traditional means. Organisational confidentiality issues, however, can complicate the situation. The project introduces 'collision' as a method of professional development, in which not only physical and organisational borders are crossed, but also mental barriers, as skills and competencies needed in global learning environments are acquired.

This is a Health Evidence Network (HEN) synthesis report on injuries in children and older people. The evidence of proven and promising strategies for the prevention of unintentional injuries in children and the older people is considerable. Legislative, environmental modification and educational approaches all have a part to play in preventing or reducing childhood injuries, and their interactive effects are encouraging. A number of interventions to reduce the incidence of falls in older people are clearly effective. Those targeting multiple risk factors are effective, although it is not possible to say which of their elements most so. HEN, initiated and coordinated by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, is an information service for public health and health care decision-makers in the WHO European Region. Other interested parties might also benefit from HEN.
Introducing Content Marketing for B2B : Case Study: Subcontracting
Controller performance program : benchmarking report : October 2013.
The thesis investigates the opportunitites that business-to-business companies have in the social media market and to facilitate an understanding of the LinkedIn environment. The objective is to create a manual supporting Nets, a company in the IT industry, to enter the social media environment through LinkedIn. The thesis consists of six parts; introduction, history of social networking sites, social media marketing, case company analysis, benchmarking and strategic planning. The benchmarking process is done through desk research, by collecting information about competitors' and non-competitors' company pages on LinkedIn. The research started in June 2013 and was completed in October 2013. The findings reveal best-in-class-examples such as videos supporting employer branding, nicheing content to reach the target groups and failures such as use of non-relevant videos, sales pitches glorifying the company and low quality graphics. The results of the benchmarking and strategic analysis are used as the basis for the LinkedIn handbook, to support the internal social media processes and create a common understanding of how to use LinkedIn for the case company.
Updated to account for ISO 55000, this third edition includes an overview of the seminal and long-awaited standard and identifies the specific points where ISO 55000 will impact maintenance and reliability. New graphics to enhance the text's main points have been added throughout. It provides a logical, step-by-step methodology that will enable any company to properly benchmark its maintenance function. It presents an overview of the benchmarking process, a detailed form for surveying and "grading" maintenance management, and a database of the results of more than 100 companies that have used this survey.

Utilizing the social media as a B2B company in the IT industry
A comprehensive collection of benchmarks for measuring dependability in hardware-software systemsAs computer systems have become more complex and mission-critical, it is imperative for systems engineers and researchers to have metrics for a system's dependability, reliability, availability, and serviceability. Dependability benchmarks are useful for guiding development efforts for system providers, acquisition choices of system purchasers, and evaluations of new concepts by researchers in academia and industry.This book gathers together all dependability benchmarks developed to date by industry and academia and explains the various principles and concepts of dependability benchmarking. It collects the expert knowledge of DBench, a research project funded by the European Union, and the IFIP Special Interest Group on Dependability Benchmarking, to shed light on this important area. It also provides a large panorama of examples and recommendations for defining dependability benchmarks.Dependability Benchmarking for Computer Systems includes contributions from a credible mix of industrial and academic sources: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Critical Software, Carnegie Mellon University, LAAS-CNRS, Technical University of Valencia, University of Coimbra, and University of Illinois. It is an invaluable resource for engineers, researchers, system vendors, system purchasers, computer industry consultants, and system integrators.
Analysing financial performance with quarterly data using self-organising maps
Student Union HELGA is a statutory part of HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences and among its other duties it implements tutoring activity. The meaning of tutoring is to help new students adapt into a new studying environment, familiarize into the habits and practices of HAAGA-HELIA and to create a pleasant studying community. In addition to adapting to the new studying environment, the international   degree students usually need to adapt into a new country and culture. Therefore the tutors of the international degree programmes need to strive to support this adaptation   process.   The goal of this study is to produce a tutor's guide for the HELGA international degree student tutors. The guide is a useful tool in daily tutoring activity and helps the   tutors support the adaptation process of the new international degree students.   The HAAGA-HELIA and HELGA organization structure, environment and special features and needs are familiarized in the study from the perspective of tutoring. To support the creation process of the tutor's guide the study handles the most important elements in theory, including benchmarking as a process of creating a written product, elements of adaptation to a new culture and some grouping theories, and different kinds of methods for improving the readability of a guidebook.   For creating and implementing a tutor's guide the most important elements turned out to be benchmarking, the structure of the annual calendar, adaptation and grouping   methods and different means of improving readability. The study benchmarks other tutor's guides used in Finnish universities of applied sciences to get the best practices   to be used in the HELGA tutor's guide. Different kinds of adaptation and grouping methods are included in the guidebook and the structure is based on the theme of easy reading.   The outcome of this thesis is the first HELGA tutor's guide. This guide serves especially the needs of the international degree student tutors. The guidebook was made into an easily modifiable format so that it can live and develop with the rapidly changing environment.
