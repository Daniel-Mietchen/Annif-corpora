War for talent - Recruitment within the financial services provider Company X
Scandinavian Financial Research Ltd (SFR) is an international research company locat-ed in Helsinki, Finland. It is the premier research and consulting partner for key decision makers in the institutional financial services market in Scandinavia. SFR conducts two main research programmes yearly: Investment Services Programme and Corporate Banking Programme. The service quality evaluations of client relationship managers, which are crucial to SFR's clients, are incorporated in both programmes. The objective of the thesis is to analyze the current evaluation criteria used to measure client relation-ship managers' service quality in the financial services industry, and to create a more refined version for SFR.    The theoretical background first briefly describes the importance and the roles of the client relationship managers in today's financial market. This is followed by a theoretical analysis of the current criteria for measuring client relationship managers' service performance. Twelve predefined criteria were created as a result of the analysis. This new set of criteria was examined and improved through in-depth interviews with financial specialists of asset management companies and corporate banking organizations.    Qualitative research methodology was adopted for this thesis. Seven structured inter-views were completed successfully in a strict and confidential manner. All the interviews were conducted on a face-to-face basis. The valuable insights and comments from inter-viewees were recorded in a research diary.    The findings indicated that all twelve criteria were important in evaluating client rela-tionship managers' service performance. While there may be differences in opinions in the order of importance for some criteria, it is imperative to note that no single criteri-on could be omitted, as evidenced from the results of the interviews.     In conclusion, this was a successful study. The study supports the theoretical back-ground and contributes to the importance of non-financial performance criteria for evaluating relationship managers in the financial service industry. The findings exceeded the expectations of commissioning party SFR. The contributions of this study for SFR are presented in chapter 6.

'Much has changed in the financial services sector since this text was first published and the global financial crisis has had a substantial impact on developments. However, the sector remains extremely competitive and, consequently, marketing strategies are of primary importance for success. This book addresses the subject area thoughtfully and perceptively and is, without question, a key reference for students whether at university or within the financial services professions.' Stewart Falconer, Edinburgh Napier University, UK 'Few text books succeed so well as Financial Services Marketing 2e in taking the reader on a global journey from marketing theory to business strategy and practice. The second edition, with additions on topics such as digital marketing and contemporary market research techniques, will surely make this one of the best-thumbed reference books a marketing professional or student could wish to have open on his or her desk.' Faye Lageu, Vice President, International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation 'The 2nd edition of this book will be of tremendous benefit to all who study it, and it will aid understanding of the Financial Services Industry, allowing greater insight into its many complexities and issues. It will be of great assistance to those wanting a deeper understanding of an industry that affects all our daily lives.'
