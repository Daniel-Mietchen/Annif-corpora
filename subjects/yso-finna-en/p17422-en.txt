Following the acclaimed Time Honored, Architectural Conservation in Europe and the Americas presents contemporary practice on a country-by-country and region-by-region basis, facilitating comparative analysis of similarities and differences. Written to "stand alone" from the predecessor volume, this book will be followed by a third and final volume covering Asia, Africa, Oceana, and the Polar Regions"--Provided by publisher.
