fertilisation in vitro
In the late 80s, Katherine Carlyle is created using IVF. Stored as a frozen embryo for eight years, she is then implanted in her mother and given life. By the age of nineteen Katherine has lost her mother to cancer, and feels her father to be an increasingly distant figure. Instead of going to college, she decides to disappear, telling no one where she has gone. What begins as an attempt to punish her father for his absence gradually becomes a testing-ground of his love for her, a coming-to-terms with the death of her mother, and finally the mise-en-scene for a courageous leap from false empowerment to true empowerment. Written in the beautifully spare, lucid and cinematic prose that Thomson is known for, Katherine Carlyle uses the modern techniques of IVF and cryopreservation to throw new light on the myth of origins. It is a profound and moving novel about where we come from, what we make of ourselves, and how we are loved.

There are more fertility clinics per capita in Israel than in any other country in the world and Israel has the world's highest per capita rate of in-vitro fertilization procedures. Fertility treatments are fully subsidized by Israeli national health insurance and are available to all Israelis, regardless of religion or marital status. These phenomena are not the result of unusually high rates of infertility in Israel but reflect the centrality of reproduction in Judaism and Jewish culture. In this ethnographic study of the new reproductive technologies in Israel, Susan Martha Kahn explores the cultural meanings and contemporary rabbinic responses to artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization, egg donation, and surrogacy. Kahn draws on fieldwork with unmarried Israeli women who are using state-subsidized artificial insemination to get pregnant and on participant-observation in Israeli fertility clinics. Through close readings of traditional Jewish texts and careful analysis of Israeli public discourse, she explains how the Israeli embrace of new reproductive technologies has made Jewish beliefs about kinship startlingly literal. Kahn also reveals how a wide range of contemporary Israelis are using new reproductive technologies to realize their reproductive futures, from ultraorthodox infertile married couples to secular unmarried women. As the first scholarly account of assisted conception in Israel, this multisited ethnography will contribute to current anthropological debates on kinship studies. It will also interest those involved with Jewish studies.

In-vitro fertilization pregnancies and perinatal health in Finland 1991-1993
The main goal of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment is a healthy mother and a healthy child. The most important complication following IVF/ICSI arises from the increased risk of multiple pregnancies. An elective single embryo transfer (eSET) with the freezing of spare embryos and subsequent treatment with frozen embryo transfer (FET) is the only way to avoid this complication. For this reason, the number of children born after FET is steadily rising.The aim of this study was to provide more detailed evidence on the safety of FET, particularly focusing on serum hormone profiles during the first trimester weeks of singleton pregnancies after IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET), after FET during a natural menstrual cycle, and after spontaneous conception. Another part of this study compared the perinatal outcomes, congenital anomalies (CAs), and morbidity of singletons born after FET and IVF/ICSI fresh ET. The reference group was those born after spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies.In the clinical prospective study, the maternal serum estradiol and progesterone levels in pregnancies after fresh ET (n=39) were higher during early pregnancy weeks than in FET (n=30) and SC pregnancies (n=41), while the hormonal profiles after FET did not differ from SC pregnancies. In the large register study, FET children (n=1830) were found to have a reduced risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, a low birthweight, and being small for their gestational age compared with children born after fresh ET (n=2942). However, FET children have an increased risk for being large for their gestational age. The major CAs and morbidity until three years of age did not differ between groups. When compared with SC children (n =31 243), the perinatal outcome was worse and the rates of CAs and morbidity were higher in FET children.The FET cycle seemed to provide a better physiological environment for early fetal development than fresh ET. Further, FET protects against some of the adverse perinatal outcomes of children when compared with fresh ET, but not when it comes to the major CAs and early somatic health.This study provides further evidence of the safety of FET in comparison with fresh ET. This information should further encourage clinicians to implement eSET combined with cryopreservation in their IVF/ICSI program.
