The religious factor in Russia's foreign policy
Early modern Finland is rarely the focus of attention in the study of European history, but it has a place in the context of northern European religious and political culture. While Finland was theoretically Lutheran, a religious plurality embodied in ceremonies and interpreted as magic survived and flourished. Blessing candles, pilgrimages, and offerings to forest spirits merged with catechism hearings and sermon preaching among the lay piety. What were the circumstances that allowed for such a continuity of magic? How were the manifestations and experiences that defined faith and magic tied together? How did western and eastern religious influences manifest themselves in Finnish magic? Faith and Magic in Early Modern Finland shows us how peripheral Finland can shed light on the wider context of European magic and religion.

Popular religion in Russia : 'double belief' and the making of an academic myth
The Holy See's foreign policies in Inter-War Europe is a collection of essays that offers new viewpoints and interpretations of the pontificates of Benedict XV (1914-1922) and Pius XI (1922-1939). The volume gives an overview of the framework within which the Holy See was navigating while trying to ensure the religious well-being of the faithful all over Europe after the Great War. The first part of the volume describes how national tensions affected the Vatican's foreign policies and the Catholic Church on local level in Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Eastern Galicia and Malta, while the second part analyses the Holy See's missionary activities: the visit of Cardinal Willem van Rossum to Finland, the religious situation in Estonia and the Crusade of Prayers for Russia.
