Morgan's first-person account of her own struggles with anxiety was published as part of 'The Vice Guide to Mental Health' and was read by five million people across fifteen countries within four days. Anxiety for Beginners will serve as a guide for those who live with anxiety and those who live with it by proxy. Combining her own experiences (rendered in emotive detail) with extensive research with experts (neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists and fellow sufferers - many of them very familiar faces), Morgan will discover that the way in which people create a life is not just manageable but enjoyable, learning to accept anxiety rather than spend a life fighting and being ashamed of it.

It's the difference between surviving life and living life. It's the difference between taking a shower and teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair. Jenny Lawson - aka The Bloggess - returns with the follow-up to her bestselling memoir Let's Pretend This Never Happened, recounting stories from everyday family life in her inimitably frank, hilarious, bizarre and endearing way. She describes her battles with depression and anxiety and her quest to overcome them by saying yes to even the absurdist opportunities and making the good times gloriously good. For as Jenny says: 'You can't experience pain without also experiencing the baffling and ridiculous moments of being fiercely, unapologetically, intensely and (above all) furiously happy...' It's a philosophy that has - quite literally - saved her life.
