The harmonization of the Tolerance analysis calculation tool was carried out for a global company that operates in telecommunication base station industry, to be used in Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. The author works for the client companys Electromechanics maintenance organization and in close cooperation with the research and development organization. The target of the thesis work was to develop and implement a tool for the analysis of the mechanical tolerance stack-ups, to be used in the client companys global organizations. The work was completed together with the project team and following the client companys review and approval processes. The back-ground knowledge is based on the employees professional experience in analyzing the tolerance stack-ups, existing tolerance analysis tools features and technical reference books. As a result of the thesis work, a mechanical tolerance stack-up analysis tool was developed and taken in use globally in the client companys Electromechanics research and development and maintenance organizations. User trainings covered 70 % of the mechanical designers in the implementation phase of the tool. Further development of the analysis tool would be beneficial by comparing its features with the existing similar commercial and non-commercial calculation tools. Additionally, a practical measurement trial should be executed that would result to a practical correlation between the statistical analysis and practical dimensions variation.

This book gathers threads that have evolved across different mathematical disciplines into seamless narrative. It deals with condition as a main aspect in the understanding of the performance ---regarding both stability and complexity--- of numerical algorithms. While the role of condition was shaped in the last half-century, so far there has not been a monograph treating this subject in a uniform and systematic way. The book puts special emphasis on the probabilistic analysis of numerical algorithms via the analysis of the corresponding condition. The exposition's level increases along the book, starting in the context of linear algebra at an undergraduate level and reaching in its third part the recent developments and partial solutions for Smale's 17th problem which can be explained within a graduate course. Its middle part contains a condition-based course on linear programming that fills a gap between the current elementary expositions of the subject based on the simplex method and those focusing on convex programming.
