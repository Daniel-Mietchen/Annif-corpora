Rehabilitation : A Post-critical Approach reexamines the philosophical foundations of rehabilitation, expanding the concept of movement beyond the physical body. Drawing from disability studies, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, cultural studies, and bioethics, this theoretically rigorous yet accessibly styled text: explores the limitations of biomedicine as the organizing framework of rehabilitation, evaluates new directions to diversify contemporary rehabilitation practice, establishes the parameters for a reconfigured ethics of rehabilitation. By embracing multiple ideas of movement―not only physical, but also social, emotional, and political―alternative approaches to rehabilitation are revealed.

The sixth edition of this popular text introducing human movement to a range of readers, offers the building blocks, signposts and opportunities to think about the application and integration of basic Human Movement theory. It confirms basic knowledge which is then applied to specific areas. Drawing on the expertise of a range of authors from the healthcare professions, the new edition has adopted a themed approach that links chapters in context. The strength of this current edition is the explicit chapter integration which attempts to mimic the realities of human movement. The themed approach explores the psychosocial influences on movement. Integration is further facilitated by increased cross-referencing between the chapters and the innovative use of one themed case study throughout. Framed about a family unit, this case study enables chapter authors to explicitly apply the content of their chapters to the real world of human movement. Taken as a whole, this more integrated format will enable readers to see the reality and complexity of human movement.
