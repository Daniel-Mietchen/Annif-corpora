This thesis includes the water quality assessment and sanitary inspection of 27 water sources in four districts namely Kavre, Rasuwa, Ramechhap and Chitwan in the Central region of Nepal. All the relevant information was collected and review by Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), Nepal with the help of its support organization. Altogether four different groups were formed, which would visit fields and carry out water quality testing. Altogether 18 physico-chemical parameters were tested and those parameters are pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, appearance, color, dissolved solids, suspended solids, alkalinity, bicarbonate, chloride, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, nitrate, ammonia, iron and manganese. Similarly, bacteriological parameter included the detection of the indicator bacteria, faecal coliform. Besides, Langlier saturation index was calculated for determining scale formation and corrosion potential.  Sanitary inspection was conducted for each water source in order to find out about the possible sources of contamination, if any.  Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed by HANA and ENPHO field kits. Faecal coliform analysis was carried out by membrane filtration method by using Del Agua field kit. Langlier saturation index was determined by calculation method and was based on the parameters like pH, temperature, calcium hardness and alkalinity. For sanitary inspection a standard form was developed and filled, which also included a check list to identify possible pollution sources. Risk levels have been assigned to each water source and there are four risk classes namely no risk, low risk, intermediate risk and high risk. Each source falls in one of the four categories based on the results obtained from physico-chemical analysis; bacteriological analysis, saturation analysis and Sanitary inspection. The results will be discussed in the details which show that there are no risks at all.

Providing inexpensive drinking water treatment solutions for developing countries - a case study on Luanda, Angola
In 2009–2011, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the United Kingdom Health Protection Agency undertook a project to investigate the adverse health effects of floods and to understand how best to protect the health of populations during floods in the WHO European Region. The project had two main components. A questionnaire was sent to 50 of the 53 Member States of the WHO European Region to collect information on recent experience of floods, their health effects and current preparedness and response mechanisms. In addition, a systematic review was undertaken of the epidemiological literature on the global impact of flooding on health. Analysis of the returned questionnaires and the peer-reviewed literature brought to light many issues pertinent to Europe. These findings will help WHO to prepare evidence-based guidance for the European Region on health concerns before, during and after flooding incidents and the measures for prevention, response and recovery.

Controlled water use is an important component of sustainable fresh-cut vegetable production because of limited water resources, and also for controlling the quality of wastewater re-used in vegetable processing or for irrigating on fields. In our study the water consumption in vegetable processing plants varied from 1.5 to 5.0 m3 t-1 of finished product. In one plant, monitored over three years, almost 90% of water was used for washing and rinsing of vegetables, but more than 90% of the organic load of the wastewater was generated from the processing stage. The results including organic load and the microbial quality of the wastewaters showed that the wastewater should be treated beforere-use.Separate treating of wastewaters from processing stage is recommended.  Pre-treatment of wastewater using precipitation chemicals and sedimentation in basins decreased the organic load and total solids in the water, allowing further treatment of the waters.

Water quality in the central region of Nepal
Rosetta branch is one of the two main branches in Nile delta and El-Rahawy drain is one of this main sources, which outlet on the branch. It is subjected to many sources of pollutions from municipalities, agriculture and industry, but only little information is available on the quality of river water. The aim of this study was to analyze the river water quality in Rosetta branch at the outlet of El-Rahawy drain, Nile delta. Water samples were collected seasonally from El-Rahawy and Rosetta branch and the following physicochemical parameters were analyzed: hydrogen ion concentration (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia (NH3), total alkalinity (CO3+HCO3); biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The results were compared with the water quality standards of Egypt (Law 48/1982), FAO and Canadian Water Quality standards (CWQGs). Statistical studies were carried out by calculating correlation coefficients between different parameters. The large transports of NH3, and TDS with low COD, BOD and DO values along El-Rahawy drain were seriously deteriorating the water quality in the downstream of Rosetta branch, especially during the low flow condition in winter.

A single and uniform fertilizer application may lead to ineffective crop nutrient uptake and use. In order to enhance nutrient use efficiency the application should be adjusted according to the need of the cultivated crop. This task is challenging because weather is unknown and unpredictable over the upcoming growing season. One solution is site-specific fertilizer application in several separate events throughout the season. Such a precision fertilization method requires information on the current crop state (e.g. the availability of water and nutrients in the soil) and a crop growth model that aims to assess current crop growth and near future needs. A field experiment with varying radiation, precipitation and nutrient conditions was established to test our crop growth model performance. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown using three fertilization rates with three precipitation and two radiation treatments within each fertilization treatment. The observed crop biomass accumulation in the highest fertilization treatment was considered as the highest possible in the prevailing conditions. The simulated (maximal) biomass accumulation was in agreement with the highest observed biomass yield. The results were found promising for further use of the model in crop growth evaluation during the growing season.

Bluey the little drip is the story of raindrops on their journey around the world. Bluey has been at the bottom of the Blue lagoon and this is the first time that he floated to the top. He was enjoying his time under the sun when all of a sudden he's evaporated and floats up into the sky and settles within a cloud full of raindrops he had never met before. He befriends a rather pretty droplet named Clara and she explains to him where he has come from and where they are going. Described by the media as education, dressed up as an enjoyable tale. Teachers have found that by reading the book to the class it awakens interest in the weather and follow the story into a lesson on the environment. Suitable for children from 4 to 8 years old and you will be amazed at how much children will love having the story read to them again and again. This is the first in a series of books and the second story 'Bluey Meets Father Christmas' has also been released.

Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.
