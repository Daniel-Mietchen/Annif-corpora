"Exploring the dramatic growth and changes in the field of vermicomposting since 1988, this comprehensive review assesses the advancements made in government-funded projects in the U.S. and UK. It discusses outdoor or indoor windows, container systems, wedge systems, and low labor-requirement, fully-automated continuous flow vermicomposting reactor systems that can process more than 1000 tons of organic wastes per reactor. It also highlights the science and biology behind the use and efficacy of vermicomposting and details the technology of the past, present, and future"--Provided by publisher.

This study deals with waste collection and treatment of the households in Addis Ababa. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the current amount and composition of the waste as well as collection and disposal methods in the city.  Based on the analysis a model is developed and a justified suggestion on suitable waste treatment tailored for the specific case. A sample of 45 000 inhabitants was taken as a case in this study. Due to financial and time constraint, the study was conducted based on literature survey and search. It was found that majority of the household waste is organic in its nature. The most suitable treatment method for treating this organic waste would be windrow composting. At the current status, all the waste from the city is being disposed in Repi open dump site without further treatment which has wide range of environmental consequences including methane production.  According to the model developed in this study the estimated final cost of waste treatment is cheaper than the amount requested by the local collection cost in the short and long term. In addition, it has a potential to be expanded to the whole Addis Ababa population.

"Co-edited by international earthworm expert Clive A. Edwards, <STRONG>Vermiculture Technology: Earthworms, Organic Wastes, and Environmental Management</STRONG>is the first international, comprehensive, and definitive work on how earthworms and microorganisms interact to break down organic wastes on a commercial basis. Many books cover the importance of composting for reducing the amount of organic wastes in landfills. This reference focuses on innovative vermiculture technology that turns organic waste into a value-added environmentally friendly products that can improve soil fertility and productivity on a large scale.<h3>Chronicles more than two decades of growth and changes in earthworm composting technology</h3>Based on the work of an outstanding international cast of scientists, the book explores the dramatic growth and changes in vermiculture technology since 1988 and assesses advances made in government-funded projects in the United States and United Kingdom. The contributors discuss outdoor and indoor windrows, container systems, wedge systems, and low labor-requirement, fully-automated continuous flow vermicomposting reactor systems that can process more than 1000 tons of organic wastes per reactor per annum. They also highlight the science and biology behind the use and efficacy of vermicomposting, examine its importance to developing countries, and detail the technology of the past, present, and future.Although the development of a range of vermicomposting technologies has been rapid and the spread of vermicomposting dramatic, the scientific literature remains scattered throughout a range of journals, newsletters, and online resources. As a compilation of information designed specifically to have an extended shelf life, this volume chronicles how vermiculture can be brought into full commercial and industrial development and find application in integrated waste management systems"--Provided by publisher.

"Because of the recent explosion of interdisciplinary research in renewable polymers, the knowledge base is scattered and it is now timely to have an overview from a respected chemist and successful author. The book focuses on biopolymers as well as low molecular compounds that can be synthesized from renewable polymers. After introducing general aspects of the field, the subsequent chapters then look at the chemistry of biodegradable polymeric types sorted by their chemical compounds, including the synthesis of low molecular compounds. The factors influencing degradation and biodegradation of polymers for food packaging in various environments is detailed at length. The medical applications covered concentrate on controlled drug delivery, temporary prostheses, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. The author then turns his attention to renewable resources for fabricating biofuels and argues for localized biorefineries as biomass feedstocks are more efficiently handled locally"--
