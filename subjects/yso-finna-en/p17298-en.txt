GAAP 2006 : interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles
Infrastructure and mobile radio devices hardware can be roughly divided in three different sections: RF (Radio Frequency), DFE (Digital Front End) and BB (Baseband). RF and DFE sections can vary between different products, but usually the BB section is very similar. Because of this the testing of the Baseband section is also similar between different products and versions. The time between different product versions is rational to minimize to keep the product schedule of a product announcement on time. This fact brings a schedule pressure to a Research and Development testing. Products should be tested faster and the test coverage should be sufficient. This Master’s thesis was commissioned by Elektrobit Wireless Communications Oy. Infrastructure and mobile radio device planning belongs to their portfolio. The aim of this Thesis was to speed up and to ease the work of test designers and test operators. It was done by creating a ready test library for the research and development phase testing. The library contains basic information and examples about different tests done to a device under test. The same library will also help in measurement instruments acquisition and resource planning. SpiraTest test management software was used in test library generation. The purpose of the Automation is to investigate how Research and Development phase Baseband testing can be speed up. LabVIEW programming language was chosen to be used as automation tool. The main reason for its selection was the available device drivers. Clock signal quality measurement test was chosen to be automated. The oscilloscope setup for different signals and results saving was automated.

The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to explore the possibilities to standardise the lashing eye plate arrangement locations on lashing bridges. The standard for lashing eye plate arrangements is intended for MacGREGOR's in-house standard on lashing bridge design. An attempt was also made to find a unified lashing bar length. By finding the unified lashing length for a bar, it could then be used in all lashing fittings on a bridge. A unified lashing bar would essentially decrease the quantity of different size lashing bars but also make all the lashing cases more compatible. The second part of the thesis is to produce a calculation tool -database and a manual to be able to explore all the lashing case lengths on different eye plate arrangement locations on both bridges. This effective multi-purpose database is intended to be used as a help when designing lashing bridges, lashing fittings and eye plate's arrangements. As a result, the lashing eye plate arrangements for both bridge types were specified. However, the ideal outcome for the unified lashing bar length could not be reached because of the total range of the lashing fittings. Creating and using the multi-purpose database was successful and worked as expected.
