"Technology, global economics, and demographics are colluding to create workspaces that thrive on communities rather than hierarchies. Our industrial paradigm with its roots in the military is swiftly being replaced by a paradigm based on networks that are held together by passion and social connections, and fueled by instantaneous interactions between members of communities. This new paradigm is creating a massive impact on how we think about successful leadership and how we develop leaders. We have found that this shift involves thinking of leaders more as Mayors and less as Generals. The Social Leader structures a new approach to leadership and provides tools for leaders to understand themselves in this new era of connectedness and community. Authors Frank Guglielmo and Sudhanshu Palshule describe and explain the five new imperatives of leadership, the Tenets of Social Leadership, illustrating ways for leaders and would-be leaders to reimagine their personal narratives and their leadership capabilities.
