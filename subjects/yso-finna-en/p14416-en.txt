Abstract: The debate over expertice in cultural policy.
The fifth edition of Management and the Arts provides you with theory and practical applications from all arts management perspectives including planning, marketing, finance, economics, organization, staffing, and group dynamics. Regardless of whether you are a manager in a theatre, museum, dance company, or opera, you will gain useful insights into strategic planning, organization, and integrated management theories. Case studies, statistics, and real-world examples will allow you get a handle on all aspects of arts managements, from budgeting and fundraising, to e-marketing and social networking, to working effectively with boards and staff members. Revised to reflect the latest thinking and trends in managing organizations and people, this fifth edition features class-tested questions in each chapter, which help you to integrate the material and develop ideas about how the situations and problems could have been handled. Case studies focus on the challenges facing managers and organizations every day, and "In the News" quotes give you real-world examples of principles and theories.
