The use of irony in music is just beginning to be defined and critiqued, although it has been used, implied and decried by composers, performers, listeners and critics for centuries. Irony in popular music is especially worthy of study because it is pervasive, even fundamental to the music, the business of making music and the politics of messaging. Contributors to this collection address a variety of musical ironies found in the 'notes themselves,' in the text or subtext, and through performance, reception and criticism. The chapters explore the linkages between irony and the comic, the tragic, the remembered, the forgotten, the co-opted, and the resistant. From the nineteenth to twenty-first centuries, through America, Europe and Asia, this provocative range of ironies course through issues of race, religion, class, the political left and right, country, punk, hip hop, folk, rock, easy listening, opera and the technologies that make possible our pop music experience. This interdisciplinary volume creates new methodologies and applies existing theories of irony to musical works that have made a cultural or political impact through the use of this most multifaceted of devices.

The primary objective of the present paper is to discuss and analyse the use of humor in the context  of multicultural classroom. This primarily theoretical discussion also attempts to gain a more  comprehensive understanding of how humor can be employed in teaching and instruction thus  contributing to learning. Fundamentally, the intention is to determine dimensions of appropriate and  benevolent humor in terms of learning. The questions to be considered in this paper are as follows: 1)  what the humor is like in classroom, and 2) why humor used in classroom is regarded appropriate or  inappropriate. For this paper, humor in classroom is studied in the light of topic related literature.  Humor as a complex form of communication is discussed here by reviewing a number of academic  publications on the topic. Furthermore, the two pivotal concepts of humor and culture are discussed  briefly. This theoretical overview is also supplemented by a few student interviews from culturally  and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The present paper focuses mainly on the theoretical aspects  of classroom humor and humor as a pedagogical tool. Through this mainly theoretically oriented  study, our aim is to identify some of those features which could potentially contribute to the use of  appropriate humor as derived from the Instructional Humor Processing Theory (IHPT) and previous  research findings. In conclusion, this study offers some viewpoints on humorous features relevant to  promoting an inspiring learning experience.

""If I could take what I've learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine was worthwhile. I'm already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you, but also my future glory in having stopped you from trying an expensive juice cleanse or thinking that it was your fault when the person you are dating suddenly backs away, intimidated by the clarity of your personal mission here on earth. No, I am not a sexpert, a psychologist or a dietician. I am not a mother of three or the owner of a successful hosiery franchise. But I am a girl with a keen interest in having it all, and what follows are hopeful dispatches from the frontlines of that struggle."

"Are you fed up with the status quo? Do you ask yourself why 1% of the world owns nearly half the wealth? Are you appalled that in a year of recession, banker's bonuses rose by around 64%? Does it anger you that multi-million dollar corporations pay hardly any tax? Do you trust your government? Always insightful, irreverent but funny, Russell Brand is asking the questions the public wants answered. This is his call to arms. This is Russell Brand's Revolution". Provided by publisher.

The objective of this thesis is to explore humor in Indian Subcontinent. It is known that Humor is different in culture, age, time and situation. European people occasionally do not understand Indian Subcontinent humor vice versa. World becomes a global village. Humor may become international over the world. Companies may use humorous messages to communicate with their customers. It is perceptible in Television, You Tube etc. Young generations may expect humorous and relaxing working environment. So humor is very much significant for both internal and external marketing communication. For this thesis, both secondary and primary data was collected from different sources. Primary data was collected through questionnaires and interviews of 25 respondents. The research work was an exploratory qualitative research work. Indian people make fun with their friends, co-workers and relatives. So it may be vital to practice more humor while doing business in Indian Subcontinent. Executives need to manage the age, religion, society, culture, time, situation and environmental factors before making humor in business. Right humor at right time in right condition can build a successful business deal. Generally Indian Subcontinent people use numerous humor tools in their daily life such as Anecdotal, Black/Dark/Morbid, Deadpan/Dry, Farcical, Hyperbolic, Ironic, Mordant, Parodic, Satirical, Screwball, Self-deprecating, Situational and Slapstick humor. Humor helps to target people, motivate employees and driving them to achieve organizational goals, reduce tiredness, monotony, boredom, improve business communications, relationships, increase trust and rapport, better morale, sales and productivity, and also improve overall effectiveness and efficiency of the workers. Right humor at right time in right situation can end up with a successful business negotiation in Indian Subcontinent.
Thirty-eight year old Emily has a satisfying job, fab friends, an amazing car and, most importantly, a wonderful flat, exactly 411 miles away from the judgemental, crazy, interfering family she reluctantly sees twice a year. In fact, the only minor stress in her life is her twenty-something neighbour Evan and his penchant for flirting, loud music and even louder sex - but he's nothing she can't handle. Emily also has a boyfriend called Robert and it's going really well. So well, in fact, that this year Emily is hoping to take him home for Christmas to meet her family. Finally she won't be subject to five days of nosy questions from her parents and pity looks from her younger married siblings. But when Robert breaks up with her a week before Christmas, Emily is gutted. How on earth is she going to face her family now? By enlisting the help of party boy Evan!

Humour is present in our everyday life, as well as in companies'  boardrooms, but it could be used more strategically in business innovation. Although there is an ample amount of research on humour in advertising, and there is increasing interest in emotions in business research, there is a gap in how to use humour in order to advance business innovation: creating new products and services. Service design thinking processes offer an opportunity to study humour in innovation workshops. The present paper discusses how humour could be studied in service design workshops of nine companies involved in a Tekes-funded humour-related research project in 2016. The purpose of the paper is to suggest a research framework in order to get more understanding of the role of humour in service design processes, particularly in workshops and their outcomes. The main research question is whether humour advances the process and the outcome of service design workshops and if yes, how. Humour and playfulness will be defined, and how to measure them discussed. The paper will accomplish the following: firstly, theoretical foundations are laid for humour, playfulness, humour in group work and humour in workshops'  outcomes. Secondly, we propose a research agenda for empirical studies. Expected results from the empirical studies will provide new insight into the importance of humour in service design workshop processes and outcomes. The contribution of the present paper will be twofold: theoretical – a research framework for analysing humour in service design processes (process and outcome) and managerial – how humour can be used to improve the service design workshops in companies, e.g. to improve the quality of the process, as well as the results. We are particularly interested in the possibility of integrating humour in business models and value propositions of companies and the present paper may contribute to this aim.
