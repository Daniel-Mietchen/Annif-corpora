"Mollison's Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine is an icon in the field of transfusion and the first edition was published in 1951.

Restaurant business and marketing are as tightly connected together as restaurant business and menu creation processes are. As customers demands and  tastes are prone to quick shifts and changes, also restaurant marketing and menu planning activities have to cope with these factors of influence. Different dietary trends  have always been dictating the course for restaurants to take and recently such a course has more and more to do with trend of health and healthy eating. A case of a marginal dietary trend called Blood Type Diet was chosen to be researched in context of restaurant marketing and menu planning process. A question was raised "How  and why could a blood type diet concept if being incorporated on a restaurant menu be used in marketing?". The question for answering was conditioned by the nature of the Blood type diet as being health promoting and unique. The research study consists of a theoretical framework building a theory proposition and an empirical part containing two different methods of data collection which are qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative content analysis of the menus.
