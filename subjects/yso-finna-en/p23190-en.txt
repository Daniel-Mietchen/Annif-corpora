"- How can managers design and implement effective high performance programmes in sport? - What are the key challenges in managing elite athletes, sports people and teams? This is the first book to provide a comprehensive introduction to management practice, process and policy in elite and high performance sport (HPS). Drawing on real-world case-studies of elite sport around the world, the book develops a new conceptual framework for studying and analysing HPS and introduces the skills and techniques that managers and administrators will need to develop effective HPS programmes. The book examines the macro level factors that determine a nation's sporting success, including political, social and cultural elements, and then moves on to unpack the specifics of elite athlete and team management at a micro level. Adopting an integrated, holistic approach throughout, the book highlights best practice in every key area of an HPS programme, including: - defining performance and success - organizational structure and leadership - finance, funding and marketing - coaching and coach development - talent identification and development - competition and events - training and facilities - scientific research and sport science support. The book features contributions from world-leading sport management academics as well as practitioners with experience of managing HPS programmes at world and Olympic level. Each chapter includes a full range of useful features, such as summaries, case-studies, review questions and guides to further reading. This is essential reading for all serious students and professionals working in sport management or high performance sport"--

This new title in the Encyclopaedia of Sports Medicine Series from the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee presents in one volume the latest information on neuromuscular function in sport and exercise. Chapters combine basic mechanistic knowledge with true applications; Topics covered include neuromuscular fatigue, neuromuscular training, and musculoskeletal loading, and special chapters examine recently developed research methodologies used during natural locomotion: high speed ultrasonography (US) and transmagnetic electrical stimulation (TMES). An important addition to the reference collections of biomechanists, sports medicine specialists, sport scientists, and graduate students in these areas, this volume is also appropriate for advanced level coaches and sport physiotherapists.

Genetics and sports
Temperature plays an important role in sports - regarding both the athlete's performance and health. However, until now, these effects, e.g. thermoregulatory mechanisms as well as the variations of body temperature during physical exertion have barely been considered. This book presents studies and results which prove that cold application has a positive influence on the athlete's performance and regeneration ability. Based on the results of international studies, and considering the control mechanisms and principles of thermoregulation, the effects of cold application should be utilized in training and competition.

This book has an outstanding compilation of comprehensible chapters dealing with the important concepts and technical minutia of the statistical analyses that sport and exercise science scholars use (or should be using!) in their efforts to conduct meaningful research in the field. It is a resource that all sport and exercise scientists and their students should have on their book shelves. Robert Eklund, School of Sport, University of Stirling, UK Motivating, to have a statistics text devoted to enabling researchers studying sport and exercise science to apply the most sophisticated analytical techniques to their data. Authors hit the mark between using technical language as necessary and user-friendly terms or translations to keep users encouraged. Text covers traditional and well-used tools but also less common and more complex tools, but always with familiar examples to make their explanations come alive. As a dynamic systems theorist and developmentalist, I would love to see more researchers in my area create study designs that would enable the use of tools outlined here, such as multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) or mediation & moderation analyses, to uncover cascades of relations among subsystems contributing to motor performance, over time. This text can facilitate that outcome. Beverly D. Ulrich, School of Kinesiology, University of Michigan, USA The domain of quantitative methods is constantly evolving and expanding. This means that there is tremendous pressure on researchers to stay current, both in terms of best practices and improvements in more traditional methods as well as increasingly complex new methods. With this volume Ntoumanis and Myers present a nice cross-section of both, helping sport and exercise science researchers to address old questions in better ways, and, even more excitingly, to address new questions entirely.
