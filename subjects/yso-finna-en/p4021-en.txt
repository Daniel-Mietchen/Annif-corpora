This book provides extensive insight into the possibilities and challenges of XML in building new information management solutions in networked organizations. After a brief introduction to Web communication features and XML fundamentals, the book examines the benefits of adopting XML and illustrates various types of XML use: XML in document management; XML for data-centric and multimedia components; XML as a format for metadata, including metadata for the Semantic Web; and XML in support of data interchange between software applications and among organizations. The challenges of adopting XML in large-scale information management are also discussed. In addition, applications across a broad spectrum are examined and numerous case studies pertaining to the adoption of XML are presented.

This thesis was commissioned by Nokia Networks as a part of a wider ongoing quality project. The main objective for this thesis and the quality project was to improve diagnostic accuracy on a certain base station product by targeting the most misdiagnosed faults and to reduce unnecessary component replacement. To achieve the objective, an early version of an automated diagnostic tool was developed. The tool was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio and C# programming language. The tool uses diagnostic databases to hold diagnostic information. The diagnostic databases were implemented using XML (Extensible Markup Language). The diagnostic databases implement fault models and rule based diagnostics to troubleshoot target products. Two pilot programs were launched in order to verify the functionality of the tool and measure improvements on diagnostic accuracy. The results of the pilots were encouraging; the rate of failed diagnoses decreased by 88%. The success of the pilot programs and the ease of use of the tool sparked interest to it, and it was decided to be taken into global use in system module repair of Nokia Networks base stations. Further development is, however, still needed to extend the coverage of the tool and to add new features.

Abstract: The goal of this project was to explain the steps taken to create a Graphical user interface (GUI) for the SIMO forest management-planning framework. This was achieved using the Flex Flash builder. The SIMO UI was built as a client-server. The method used in the project was to devise an experimental model that would make it easy to build the GUI with fewer codes and still makes it flexible and easy to maintain in the near future. Mapping the XML directly with the components model was finally used since it is the only popular method used frequently in encoding and decoding XML documents. The results obtained showed that the Flex Adobe datagrid was not fully developed for the project and as such, I had to create a custom datagrid, the datasheet. Furthermore, as at the time of building the GUI, there was no credible way to work with namespaced XML. This problem was later solved through a series of research and writing custom-components to suit the application. In conclusion, the goal of the project was achieved, flexibility and maintainability, but at the expense of excess codes.
