The purpose of this thesis was to produce two value-related product studies: a cost-in-use product research and an image research, for the tissue manufacturer Georgia-Pacific Nordic Oy. The subject of the thesis was topical as the Lotus Professional product family had recently been renewed. Studies of these kinds had not been done for several years and had not been done at all for the current products. The studies were meant to support the sales, marketing and product development of Lotus Professional products. The theoretical framework consists of literature on marketing research, cost-in-use research and value-based marketing. These sections enlighten the research methods and help understanding how to take advantage of the findings. Altogether eight kitchen tissue products were tested in a fast food restaurant kitchen in the city centre of Tampere in the summer of 2010. Tests covered seven of Georgia-Pacific's own Lotus Professional products and a Metsä Tissue Katrin product, which was in use in the restaurant at that time.  The cost-in-use study was carried out as an observation research, which measured the disparities between the consumption of these eight products. In a separate survey the employees of the same restaurant were asked about different features of kitchen tissues that they value. These studies did not address the issue of product pricing. The studies gave quite parallel information about the rank order of the test objects. It seemed that small consumption volumes go along with the positive images that the products evoke. Small consumption is, in fact, also one of the most valued qualities of kitchen tissue products.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health problem, which is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry, problems that are difficult to control. In the general population, the 12-month prevalence of GAD is 2-3%, with the lifetime prevalence being about 5%. However, GAD is more prevalent among primary care utilizers i.e. approximately 5-8% of them suffer from this disorder. Earlier studies have revealed GAD to be associated with a high utilization of health care resources.There were four goals of the present study; i) to investigate the prevalence of GAD among Finnish health care high utilizers, ii) to examine the association between GAD and utilization of different health care services at the population level, iii) to determine whether there would be any association between frequent utilization of health care services, GAD and somatic symptoms and iv) to compare the costs associated with GAD in secondary care in Finland with those attributable to major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, the Finnish translation of the 7-item GAD scale (GAD-7) was validated.In a sample (n=150) of health care high utilizers in northern Finland, the prevalence of GAD was found to be 4%; GAD-7 was a valid instrument for detecting GAD in these subjects.In Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort, there was a significant association between GAD and health care utilization. Those subjects who screened positive for GAD with GAD-7 made 112% more total health care visits than other individuals. The results were statistically significant when controlled for potential confounders. Both GAD symptoms and physical symptoms were risk factors for frequent attendance of health care services, and the individuals who tested positive for GAD exhibited a higher rate of physical symptoms.Secondary care costs of all patients with a new diagnosis of GAD or MDD were calculated 2 years before and after the diagnosis date using the information from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers and National Hospital Benchmarking Database. Patients with a history of earlier depression or anxiety disorder had markedly higher costs compared with patients without psychiatric comorbidities. The highest mean individual costs (€19,538) during the 4-year follow-up were observed among patients with new onset of GAD but with a history of other anxiety disorders or MDD.
