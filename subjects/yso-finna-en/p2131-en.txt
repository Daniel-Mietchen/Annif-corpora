Multiple Regression and Beyond offers a conceptually oriented introduction to multiple regression (MR) analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), along with analyses that flow naturally from those methods. By focusing on the concepts and purposes of MR and related methods, rather than the derivation and calculation of formulae, this book introduces material to students more clearly, and in a less threatening way. In addition to illuminating content necessary for coursework, the accessibility of this approach means students are more likely to be able to conduct research using MR or SEM--a.

"Mathematicians have found it useful to enumerate all sorts of things arising in discrete mathematics: elements of finite groups, configurations of ones and zeros, graphs of various sorts; the list is endless. Analytic combinatorics uses analytic techniques to do the counting: generating functions are defined and their coefficients are then estimated via complex contour integrals. This book is the result of nearly fifteen years work on developing analytic machinery to recover, as effectively as possible, asymptotics of the coefficients of a multivariate generating function. It is the first book to describe many of the results and techniques necessary to estimate coefficients of generating functions in more than one variable"--

Econometric Analysis serves as a bridge between an introduction to the field of econometrics and the professional literature for social scientists and other professionals in the field of social sciences, focusing on applied econometrics and theoretical background. This book provides a broad survey of the field of econometrics that allows the reader to move from here to practice in one or more specialized areas. At the same time, the reader will gain an appreciation of the common foundation of all the fields presented and use the tools they employ.

"This important resource bridges the gap between imaging, optics, and photonics, and statistics and data analysis. The text contains a wide range of relevant statistical methods including a review of the fundamentals of statistics and expanding into multivariate techniques. The techniques are explained in the context of real examples from remote sensing, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, signal processing, color science, and other related disciplines. The book also emphasizes intuitive and geometric understanding of concepts. The topics that are most relevant to imaging, optics, and photonics applications are covered thoroughly. In addition, supplemental topics are discussed to provide an overview of when and how the methods can be used".
