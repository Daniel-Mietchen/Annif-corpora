Strategic internal communication : how to build employee engagement and performance
A Google executive once said: "If you want to liberate a society just give them the Internet." But how does one liberate a society that already has the Internet? Publicly, modern government adheres to the twin ideals of institutional transparency and personal privacy. In reality, while citizens are subjected to mass surveillance, government practice goes unchecked. A new generation has taken to the Internet to defend the right to governance without secrets. From Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks to LulzSec and Anonymous, from the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative to the revelations of Edward Snowden, a coalition is breaking through the secrecy that lies at the core of the modern state. The story gets more complex when open government is contrasted with black transparency, and when a geopolitical rift between the West and Russia becomes the dividing line for whistleblowers and transparency activists seeking refuge. What is transparency for one may be propaganda for the other.

The mobile phone business is in transformation and so is Nokia as well. It means that rapid changes are needed almost constantly and it is affecting the employees more or less dramatically. Organizations are forced to change and more efficiency is wanted. These rapid changes need good management and strong personalities in charge who are able to coach the employees through the changes and without jeopardizing the performance too much. The purpose of this Thesis was to study the operational mode of the Nokia Salo Hardware organization before and after the big organizational change which took place in 2009. The research made before the organizational change gave a good background for the further research after the organizational change. The purpose was to study how the organizational change affected the job profiles of the employees, responsibilities, the working methods, the co-operation between different teams and information sharing. This Thesis was qualitative in nature and was conducted in close co-operation with the Salo Hardware organization. The research methods were interviews, group interviews, meetings, discussions and the literature overview. The research strategies used in the study were the survey research and case study research strategies. As results, there were some deficiencies found in the operation of the Salo Hardware organization. There were improvements needed at least in the information sharing, in the job profiles of the Project Managers, in the project organization structures and in the change management. Based on the results of this Thesis, new information sharing meetings were started and the job profiles of the project managers were made clearer along with the unified project organizations in Salo. The changes made based on this Thesis brought some more unity to the Salo Hardware organization and clarity after the dramatic organizational change.

The role of discussion forums in corporate communications : case Finnair
This study was conducted in order to address the challenges Inex Partners Oy has in the lateral communication between Processed Food and Daily Non-Food Products department and Purchasing department. This study argues that the challenges in lateral communication are due to three main issues. These are challenges in general communication such as inadequate relationship forming between the members of the two departments, geographical distance between the two departments and lack of communication guidelines from the management. The challenges are also derived from the way the members of the two departments are forming and are not forming effective cross functional teams. Thirdly the challenges are due to the way knowledge is managed in the organization. The research problem was: Why is the lateral information flow between the two departments not working in Inex Partners Oy? The research problem addressed a situation; a phenomenon at a certain time, and thus the research is cross-sectional and exploratory. The research approach is inductive and the research method is qualitative due to the context related and human aspect of the issue. The interview questions were derived from different related theories and the questions addressed the research problem from various angles. The data provided a lot of relevant and enlightening information regarding the problem and thus the analysis of the data gave valuable answers to the problem.   The findings of this study truly answer the research problem from various aspects and they truly enlighten the problem from a new point of view. As the study does not concentrate purely on communication but it also takes into account the human aspect and the knowledge management aspect of the challenge, this study provides new information to Inex Partners Oy that can help the company to take actions to overcome the challenge.

Utilization of Media in Internal Communication : Case: Konecranes Heavy Lifting Ltd, Electrics Factory
This thesis investigates and addresses problems in information sharing between Nokia battery development team and selected battery subcontractors. The main aim of this thesis was to develop the information sharing process between Nokia and selected battery manufacturers. In addition to the process development, the target was to create a new tool to improve information flow and to help consolidation of the new process at Nokia. Theoretical context briefly discusses battery industry and battery technologies used in mobile devices. The main focus of the theoretical context is on research methods that were utilized in this thesis and in the process development. Expansive learning method developed by Professor Yrjö Engeström is the baseline for the theoretical context. Expansive learning cycle is a theoretical generalization about the development in operational modes and it can bring theoretical research as a part of development process. In the expansive learning the development process is not led by one person only but substantial persons are invited to participate in the development and expansive learning process. Substantial persons' participation is needed in order to share experiences and improvement ideas during the reflection process. Substantial persons can help in consolidation of the new process and operation mode. Theoretical context addressed in this thesis is obtained from literature and electronic resources. Theoretical context is focusing on literature and articles written by Professor Engeström and concentrating on expansive learning theory and methodology. Research proves that the expansive learning method is an efficient research method to engage people in developing operation modes and implementing new operational modes in use. In this thesis information sharing process between Nokia battery development team and battery subcontractors was successfully improved by utilizing steps of expansive learning.

Black transparency is an involuntary disclosure of secrets against a backdrop of systematic online surveillance, as large parts of contemporary life move into the digital realm. Black transparency, as a radical form of information democracy, has brought forward a new sense of unpredictability to international relations, and raises questions about the conscience of the whistleblower, whose personal politics are now instantly geopolitical. Empowered by networks of planetary-scale computation, disclosures today take on an unprecedented scale and immediacy. Difficult to contain and even harder to prevent, black transparency does not merely create openness, order, and clarity; rather, it triggers chaos, stirring the currents of a darker and more mercurial world. Metahaven was founded in 2007 by Vinca Kruk and Daniel van der Velden. In Black Transparency - part essay, part fanzine - Metahaven embark on a journey of subversion, while examining transparency's intersections with design, architecture, and pop culture, as well as its ability to unravel the circuitry of modern power.

The purpose of this thesis is to find out how to make communication in a virtual working team more efficient, so that work processes and outcomes do not suffer from shortcomings in the information flow and team communication. In order to improve information flow in a team of a global company, the study of communication processes within a virtual team was conducted. The results of the study provide benefits to the case company because improved communication in dispersed teams results in time savings, cost savings, increased efficiency and higher motivation among the employees. The theoretical framework was based on a wide scope of literature and internet sources regarding communication in virtual teams and management of information flow within them. The practical part of study was based on the results of qualitative survey which was held in November 2009. The purpose of the survey was to find out the team members' perception towards internal communication within the dispersed team and the level of satisfaction with it, as well as the usage of the communication channels within the particular virtual team. The results of the online survey also assisted in defining the current shortcomings in internal communication of the case team and clarifying the reasons why these shortcomings are present within the team. Special attention was paid to the e-mail communication channel, as it was the most commonly used channel by the contact person from the company management.  The project was initiated in October 2009. The interviews have been conducted within a month from the beginning. The results have been analyzed and conclusions have been made in the period from February to March 2010. The work has been finalized in April 2010. Despite all the advantages of virtual working teams, the most of which are presented in this paper, there are communication problems which constantly occur in dispersed teams due to the fact that they are more challenging to manage than classic co-located teams. The communication processes which take place in dispersed teams are more complex and require further studies. During the research process some general key findings concerning communication and information flow in dispersed teams have been made and pointed out as the essential elements of successful virtual communication in the summary. The potential solutions for the shortcomings in communication processes within the researched virtual team are also provided in this paper. The objectives set for the study were fully met.
