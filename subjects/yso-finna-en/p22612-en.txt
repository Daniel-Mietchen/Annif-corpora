Explaining workplace bullying : a review of enabling, motivating and triggering factors in the work environment
Men's use of sexuality to exercise power over women has been a central arena for feminist analysis and political action throughout this century. Sexual harassment, a key strategy in this exercise of power, has been named and resisted by feminists for more than two decades. While considerable gains have been made, the contemporary backlash also poses a considerable threat - in the face of which, the development of more sophisticated theory and more effective practice regarding sexual harassment is essential. Collectively, the chapters in this book offer a range of new insights and strategies for advancing the feminist struggle against sexual harassment in the late 1990s.
