Outsmarting social media : profiting in the age of friendship marketing
Abstract: The purpose of this project was to design a website MyInstrumentalMusic.com that focuses on up and coming, signed, unsigned, independent and currently popular music producers to sell their instrumental music online. The site promotes the instrumentals uploaded by the music producers exposing their talent for the artist who wants to make use of it. This social media format supports and encourages the interaction between producers and artists online. Producers show off their music by uploading their instrumentals to the market and make money out of it. The site is looking forward to shorten and improve the long-distance relationship that is holding music producers and artists to work together. MyInstrumentalMusic.com believes that exposed talent can be harvested easily with less pain bringing success in a short period of time. The website is designed from scratch using the Zend Framework. The entire project was developed and tested on my home computer using the XAMPP server which is an open source cross-platform web server capable of serving dynamic web pages.  www.MyInstrumentalMusic.com.

Guideline for companies: creating digital marketing communications plan
The aim of the presented paper is to give guidelines for SMEs and marketers for the beginning of the Internet marketing process in Russia. For many SMEs Internet marketing is not used efficiently, often because of a lack of knowledge or interest. Russia is a unique market, and Internet marketing there is no exception. The focus of this paper is in Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), which basically is a process which increases a website's visibility in a search engine, such as Google or Yandex. The amount of reliable reference material in English is very limited. The author's experience in working as an entrepreneur operating in the field of Russian Internet marketing was utilized in this paper. Two projects are used as references – Artic-kaihdin Oy's Russian website and Gardiset Finland Oy's website. This study presents the features of Internet marketing and how they can be implemented. The special importance of SEO is highlighted, as Russia has its own search engine, Yandex. The dominant role of Yandex is evident, which is why SEO has to be done for Yandex. The SEO process for Yandex differs from that of Google's, although the basic principle is the same – make and put relevant content on the website. Internet marketing is highly measurable. Calculation of Return On Investment (ROI) is fast and simple. Measurements and analyses serve as the bases of successful Internet marketing. All features of Internet marketing can be suggested to most SME's if results of the campaigns are analyzed.
