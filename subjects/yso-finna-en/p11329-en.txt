"The collapse of the Napoleonic order in 1814 symbolised a victory over revolutionary principles, yet it was impossible to turn the clock back and negate the legacy of the Revolution and the Napoleonic age. Could monarchical claims for personal government be realistically reconciled with the legacy of the Revolution? This dilemma gave rise to the concept of a genuinely 'monarchical' form of political rule in Europe, which distinguished itself not only from absolutism and revolutionary constitutionalism, but also British parliamentarianism. Focusing on the genesis of 'constitutional monarchism' in the context of the French Restoration and its favourable reception in post-Napoleonic Germany, this study highlights the potential and limitations of the daring attempt to improve traditional forms of monarchical legitimacy by means of a modern representative constitution. With historical, legal and politico-theoretical aspects equally examined, this work contributes towards a clearer understanding both of the 19th century and European constitutionalism."--
Constitution of the United Kingdom : a contextual analysis
Monarchies 1000-2000
Spin and photo opportunities may appear to have emerged on to the political scene only recently, but in fact image and its manipulation have always been vital to the authority of rulers. This book, the second in Kevin Sharpe's trilogy exploring image, power, and communication in early modern England, examines its importance during the turbulent seventeenth century. From the coronation of James I to the end of Cromwell's protectorate, Sharpe considers how royalists and parliamentarians - often using the same vocabularies - sought to manage their public image through words, pictures, and performances in order to win support and secure and enhance their authority.

Patriarcha and other writings
This book is about one of the most powerful and influential dynasties in English history, a dynasty of five monarchs who ruled their domain for over a century. The Tudors were concerned with building a government that would endure, hence their constant concern with succession, an anxiety which lasted throughout the century. Although all Tudor monarchs believed that their authority derived from God, they had different ways of expressing that conviction, and above all they believed in ruling with consent and advice. For this reason they built partnerships, not with the old nobility as their predecessors had done, but with the wider community of the gentry, and above all with parliament. These partnerships with the church and state lasted for centuries and still influence British politics today.

A new edition of James Collins's acclaimed synthesis that challenged longstanding views of the origins of modern states and absolute monarchy through an analysis of early modern Europe's most important continental state. Incorporating recent scholarship on the French state and his own research, James Collins has revised the text throughout. He examines recent debates on 'absolutism'; presents a fresh interpretation of the Fronde and of French society in the eighteenth century; includes additional material on French colonies and overseas trade; and ties recent theoretical work into a new chapter on Louis XIV. He argues that the monarchical state came into being around 1630, matured between 1690 and 1730 and, in a new final chapter, shows that the period May 1787 to June 1789 was an interregnum, with the end of the Ancien Régime coming not in 1789 but with the dissolution of the Assembly of Notables on 25 May 1787.

In this meditation on the British state, its identity and culture, Tom Nairn sees the monarchy both as its apex and its essence, the symbol of a national backwardness. This book lays bare Britain 's peculiar, pseudo-modern, national identity, one that remains fixated on the Crown and its constitutional framework, the parliamentary sovereignty of Westminster.
