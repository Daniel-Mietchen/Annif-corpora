"In recent years, building a corporate online presence has become nonnegotiable for businesses, as consumers expect to connect with them in as many ways as possible. There are benefits to companies that use online technology, but there are risks as well. Managing Online Risk presents the tools and resources needed to better understand the security and reputational risks of online and digital activity, and how to mitigate those risks to minimize potential losses. Managing Online Risk highlights security and risk management best practices that address concerns such as data collection and storage, liability, recruitment, employee communications, compliance violations, security of devices (in contexts like mobile, apps, and cloud computing), and more. Additionally, this book offers a companion website that was developed in parallel with the book and includes the latest updates and resources for topics covered in the book"--

The ultimate guide to assessing and exploiting the customer value and revenue potential of the Cloud A new business model is sweeping the world--the Cloud. And, as with any new technology, there is a great deal of fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding cloud computing. Cloudonomics radically upends the conventional wisdom, clearly explains the underlying principles and illustrates through understandable examples how Cloud computing can create compelling value--whether you are a customer, a provider, a strategist, or an investor. Cloudonomics covers everything you need to consider for the delivery of business solutions, opportunities, and customer satisfaction through the Cloud, so you can understand it--and put it to work for your business. Cloudonomics also delivers insight into when to avoid the cloud, and why. * Quantifies how customers, users, and cloud providers can collaborate to create win-wins * Reveals how to use the Laws of Cloudonomics to define strategy and guide implementation * Explains the probable evolution of cloud businesses and ecosystems * Demolishes the conventional wisdom on cloud usage, IT spend, community clouds, and the enterprise-provider cloud balance Whether you're ready for it or not, Cloud computing is here to stay. Cloudonomics provides deep insights into the business value of the Cloud for executives, practitioners, and strategists in virtually any industry--not just technology executives but also those in the marketing, operations, economics, venture capital, and financial fields.

The existence of dominant companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. result in a dangerous situation in terms of abuses of data protection and data security legislation. It is important to specify the term “dominant” or “dominance” as, in my opinion, the existing definition from a competition law perspective does not apply to the situation concerning privacy and data protection. So far law has not presented any other sufficient way to describe “dominance”..

We react quickly to the changes occurring in working life and the requirements of new competence.    At the degree programme of Information Technology we aim to develop our teaching to include more real-life project work: our curricula include increasingly more company-related projects. This way we are able to provide our students with a more realistic view of the everyday work at companies, and also improve their employment opportunities.    The purpose of this publication is to spread the word about the projects and results achieved by the students and staff of the Information Technology department. In addition to student projects, our department is also involved in many domestic and international projects well worth mentioning. Yearly, our students complete hundreds of thesis and project work. This publication also presents good examples of our successful projects.

Abstract: This thesis was motivated by my professional interest in Enterprise Application Software (EAS). Before I would be able to address the subject of my interest I needed to build a framework that could be used for the thesis.  The goal of this thesis was to create a framework which can be used to analyze the applicability of EAS for different industries by certain applicability criteria. There are so many different EAS today for each software category that companies and organizations struggle during software acquisition processes with the challenge to determine the best candidate to their particular business. This thesis aimed to analyze the factors to be considered be-fore and during the evaluation of the acquisition options.  The theoretical part of this thesis was built to separately determine the software and in-dustry categories and applicability criteria. The theory on software consists of Business Intelligence (BI), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Database and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The theory on industries covers the banking, manufacturing and telecommunications industries where telecommunications is considered as a service pro-vider.  When the framework was finished it was utilized to perform an applicability analysis with it. The analysis was focused on every software category at a time. Every software catego-ry was analyzed for every industry by the chosen applicability criteria. The analysis led to conclusions on how to weigh different evaluation factors during the acquisition process.
