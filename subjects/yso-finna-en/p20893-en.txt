Operational key performance indicators for merchant vessels
Bridge procedures guide
The aim of this thesis was to recognize key performance indicators for Wärtsilä Control and Communication Center. The data and legislation of the key performance indicators was also studied and possible problems of the usage. The information was mainly collected from literature and also personnel interview was used. In the second chapter the history of bridge design was under observation. Wärtsilä marine product portfolio was also reviewed in this section which gave understanding the of the used machinery. Environmental regulations and history and usage of key performance indicators were also presented in this chapter. In the third chapter data for the key performance indicator was studied and also most cases the regulations were introduced. The key performance indicators were chosen based on Wärtsilä request and the data sources and calculation formulas were presented. In the last chapter chosen key performance indicators were suited to Wärtsilä Control and Communication Center architecture and possible usage of them were introduced.
