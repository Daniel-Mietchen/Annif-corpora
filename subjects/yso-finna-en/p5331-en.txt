The masculinities reader
American manhood : transformations in masculinity from the Revolution to the modern era
Type A behavior pattern revisited long-term follow-up from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease study
In this book Victor J Seidler, one of the leading contributors to the growing debate about masculinities, turns his attention to the lives of young men and their understandings of themselves as gendered beings. By contextualizing their experiences and subjectivities within a rapidly globalizing world, Seidler pays particular attention to the impact of the global media. How does the mass circulation of images of men's bodies, desires and sexualities affect their self-perception and behaviours, and how are these images framed within particular histories, cultures and traditions? Questioning universalist theories of 'hegemonic masculinities', the book argues that young men often feel caught between prevailing masculinities and their own struggle for self-definition. It explores both how the idea of men as 'the First Sex' has been established within the West and the ways in which men in other cultures and societies affirm their gendered identities. Seidler pioneers new methodologies that involve listening to the silences surrounding male experience as well as to oral testimonies. This enables innovative analysis of the contradictions young men are faced with in both creating their own gendered identities and establishing more equal relationships within a world of intense inequalities.

In the first comprehensive history of American manhood, E. Anthony Rotundo sweeps away the groundless assumptions and myths that inform the current fascination with men's lives. Opposing the views of men's movement leaders and best-selling authors who maintain that manliness is eternal and unchanging, Rotundo stresses that our concept of manhood is man-made and that, like any human invention, it has a history. American Manhood is a fascinating account of how our understanding of what it means to be a man has changed over time.

Lesbian and gay studies : an introductory, interdisciplinary approach
In the present paper we investigate how fatherhood influences childbirth in the second union of men in three European countries. We use data from the first wave of the Generations and Gender Survey for France (2005), Norway (2007/8) and Hungary (2004/5) and we apply piecewise exponential event history models. The analysis complements earlier literature by focusing on men, taking a comparative perspective, looking at change over time, considering both cohabiting and marital unions, and also differentiating between the effects of non-residential and (part- or full-time) residential fatherhood.    Findings show that the probability of childbearing in the second union is the lowest if both partners already have child(ren) and highest if neither of them are parents. However we found different results if only one of the partners has pre-union children in the three countries. Findings are discussed in view of demographic trends, family and gender role attitudes, and relevant family policies.

Responsible fatherhood : a narrative approach
Knowledge of the terms sex and gender has important political, health and equity considerations. This book investigates a macro-structural social theory of gender (Connell, 1995), which proposes a relational and hierarchical conception of gender, and explores it in local social contexts. As the theory of gender is primarily concerned with differing configurations of masculinity, most notably hegemonic masculinity (a dominative form of masculinity), this book focuses on males and their relations with one another in secondary schools and all-male elite-level sporting teams. Specifically, this book overcomes a major theoretical impasse by recognizing that the ideology of supremacy of a dominative masculinity is necessarily interdependent with the structural relations of power and culturally defined norms of masculinity. Relations between masculinities are reframed into specific social network hypotheses, and quantitatively examined using statistical models for social networks. Hierarchies of masculinities that are misogynist, homophobic and violent can occur, though local context is particularly important and alternative non-dominative masculinities are possible.
Considered the Bible of men's studies, the meticulously researched The Myth of Male Power takes the listener around the world, throughout history, biology, the Bible, the law, and everyday life, challenging every assumption about men. The Myth of Male Power distinguishes between men s institutional power and genuine power. Farrell says genuine power is "control over one's life." He documents that virtually every society that has survived has done so by persuading its sons to be disposable--whether in war or in work; and therefore indirectly as dads. And disposability is not power. Farrell explains, "The road to high pay is a toll road tolls such as working more hours, and taking 24 of the 25 worst jobs..."; Farrell posits that men have mistakenly defined power as feeling obligated to earn money someone else spends while he dies sooner. In the past, Farrell says, neither sex had power; both sexes had roles: women's role: raise children; men's role: raise money. Our grandparents didn't preach rights they preached responsibilities and obligations. Both genders sacrificed so their children s lives would be better than theirs. Dr. Farrell challenges the belief that men made the rules to benefit men at the expense of women. He writes that if the rules were designed to just benefit men, then women would be socialized to desire and initiate sex with men, pay on dates, buy men diamonds; there would be female-only draft registration; and post- divorce, women would be the sex most likely to lose their home and children.

Studying men and masculinities
The late-twentieth-century anxiety about a 'crisis in masculinity' still persists today, particularly in English-speaking cultures. Studying Men and Masculinities offers an engaging and comprehensive overview of masculinity. Drawing on a wide range of cultural practices and texts from different genres and media, David Buchbinder examines the notion of patriarchy and the challenges to patriarchal power, including queer theory. The book considers whether crisis may in fact be built into the very structure of the masculine, and examines emergent masculinities post-9/11. Theoretical positions within the field are clearly explained and applied to real life case studies from literature, film, and television. Interspersed in each chapter are a series of questions and tasks aimed at encouraging the reader to engage her/himself in the study of masculinities in everyday life and popular culture.

Gender and laughter : comic affirmation and subversion in traditional and modern media
"Why did traditional Chinese literati so often identify themselves with women in their writing? What can this tell us about how they viewed themselves as men and how they understood masculinity? How did their attitudes in turn shape the martial heroes and other masculine models they constructed? Martin Huang attempts to answer these questions in this valuable work on manhood in late imperial China. He focuses on the ambivalent and often paradoxical role played by women and the feminine in the intricate negotiating process of male gender identity in late imperial cultural discourses. On the one hand, women were shunned as a threat to manhood; on the other, they were celebrated as the natural exemplars of loyalty, an important Confucian virtue. Thus the image of the loyal minister was often problematized by the feminine implications of Confucian loyalty." "At the first book-length study of late imperial Chinese masculinities, this volume covers a wide range of primary texts, including Confucian classics, historical narratives, political treatises, poems, essays, dramas, fictional narratives, and conduct guides. It emphasizes the nuances and pluralistic nature of masculinities as they were being constantly contested and reinvented."--BOOK JACKET.

Masculinities in theory : an introduction
Turning on its head that familiar "woman question," this innovative work poses masculinity as a problem that requires explanation. Ferguson rebukes the sense of coherence contained in patriarchal theory in the name of a voice that both calls upon and challenges the category woman. Stepping back from the opposition of male and female, she artfully loosens the hold of gender on life and meaning, creating and at the same time deconstructing a women's point of view. Posing the "man question" provides a way not only to view male power and female subordination but also to valorize and problematize women's experiences, thus destabilizing conventional notions of man and woman.

In Male Impersonators, Mark Simpson explores the range of male life and masculinity, posing witty and important questions about bodybuilding, tatoos, pornography, cruising, advertising, and team sports. Simpson looks at how gay men appropriate the skinhead phenomenon and why; how Marky Mark exploits the hustler mystique and hwat it says to gay and straight men; how the Men's movement is being sought out by men - straight or gay - who feel alienated from a macho culture, and compares the participation and reactions of men to various "manly pursuits." Throughout, Male Impersonators examines the roles of homoeroticism and narcissism in the male world, and the performativity of masculinity itself.
African masculinities : men in Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present
"The reader, whether a professional health care worker, researcher, clinician, or concerned individual, will obtain a clearer perspective on the connections between men's health and gender, along with a broader conceptualization of the experiences of men in contemporary society. --Choice Men's Health and Illness contextualizes men's health issues within the broader theoretical framework of the new men's studies. This framework focuses on the profound influence of gender on social life and individual experience. The editors and chapter contributors of this groundbreaking volume argue that gender is a key factor for understanding the patterns of men's health risks, the ways men perceive and use their bodies, and men's psychological adjustment to illness itself. Part I introduces readers to men's studies perspectives and explains their relevance for understanding men's health. Part II explores the linkages between traditional gender roles, men's health, and larger structural and cultural contexts, and Part III examines the implications of multiple masculinities for health issues. The scope of this volume is both multidisciplinary and international. The authors use quantitative and qualitative research methodologies which provide a well-rounded analysis of the subject matter. Taken collectively, the contributions to Men's Health and Illness reflect current efforts by men's studies practitioners to develop theoretical explanations of men's lives that also refer to the influences of class, race, ethnicity, sexual preference, and age. "This collaborative effort in presenting research and theories is so significant that it should become part of the literature studied by advocates of women's studies and men's studies. The reader, whether professional healthcare worker, researcher, clinician, or concerned individual will obtain a clearer perspective on the connections between men's health and gender, along with a broader conceptualization of the experiences of men in contemporary society. Upper-division undergraduate through professional." --Choice.
"Men aren't what they used to be" : Male-female relationships in Kate Atkinson's crime fiction
This book explores the challenges posed to "masculine identity" during a period of growing scepticism about the idea of fixed identities. Postmodernism and poststructuralism have produced new ways of thinking about the indicidual and the social. They have undermined the assumptions on which stable identities have been constructed, such as the assumption that there exists stable bodies and stable selves. "Sex," "gender," "sexuality," and "race" are no longer viewed as merely descriptive aspects of experience, but also as constructions of "identity." Scholars researching and writing in the academic area of men's studies and of member of the pro-feminist men's movement have failed to engage with recent theory and to criticall reflect on the epistemology of masculinity. Increasingly, the field of men's studies is looking like a separatist enterprise and many strands of the men's movement are clearly reactionary. Scholars and activists have neglected recent developments in postmodern feminism, feminist philosophy of science, antiracist/postcolonial studies, and queer theory, which pose important questions for thinking about men, masculinity, sexuality, and identity. Masculinity has tended to be treated in isolation from power relations and historical and global contexts. This book attempts to rethink masculinities. It considers the way in which discourse fabricates the "ideal" male body, sexual identity, and sexual identity politics. The book explores the possibilities of new models of identity not so closely linked to the sex/gender system and for a new or reconceptualized identity politics. Fresh, lucid, and invigorating, this book provides a stimulating guide to the debates around men and masculinities as well as opening up new questions for researchers and teachers to consider. It will be required reading for students in sociology, cultural studies, and sexualities.

Men in the lives of young children ; an international perspective
This contribution to "men's studies" examines the emergence of masculinity as a marketing tool through the proliferation of men's style magazines, to the stylized images of masculinity which are used to sell products such as deodorants or jeans. The text explores how masculinity has been constructed in the consumer society, and analyzes the hierarchy of masculinity which valorizes some men and denigrates others. Starting with an historical review of men's fashion and a discussion of its importance and meanings, the author proceeds to analyze contemporary marketing of menswear and masculinity in advertising and the media, and considers the politics of fashion for men in terms of gender, class, race and sexuality.
For sociologist Henning Bech, the image of the male homosexual has become emblematic of the modern urban condition, in which freedom and mobility contend with transience and superficiality, in which possibility, energy, and engagement vie with uncertainty and restlessness. In this powerful and frankly provocative critique, Bech skillfully examines the distinctive relationship between urban modernism and the gay experience, exploring in compelling fashion its growing ramifications for the cultural mainstream. Gay society has persevered, even flourished, in this highly charged urban environment, aestheticizing and sexualizing the spaces, both public and private, where men meet. With profound insight and honesty, Bech details this world, candidly reflecting on sex, friendship, love, and life as manifest in the homosexual form of existence. He convincingly demonstrates that, in the face of modern alienation, successful coping strategies developed by gay men are gradually being adopted by mainstream heterosexual society. These adaptations are often masked by what Bech calls an "absent homosexuality, " in which sublimated themes of homosexuality and masculine love surface, only to be disavowed in expressions of social anxiety. This "absent homosexuality" acts as a kind of cultural filter, allowing key traits of gay life to be absorbed by the mainstream, while shielding heterosexual males from their own homophobic anxieties. Ultimately, Bech foresees, a postmodern convergence of hetero- and homosexual forms of exisce emergent from this urban landscape and, with it, a new masculine synthesis. Certain to ignite immediate controversy, When Men Meet offers both a penetrating scholarly analysis of the modern homosexual condition and an unflinching cultural vision of the masculine in transition.

Combining historical and ethnographic analysis, this book deals with the making of the heterosexual imagination from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present in the Indian context. This unique book uses methods from anthropology, cultural studies and history to explore the making of modern cultures of sexuality in India. It provides an analysis of the sexual and domestic politics of the period by focusing on the vast corpus of publications and journals on sexology from the 1920s to the 1940s, and links Indian activities with those in other parts of the world. The author analyzes material that has thus far been outside the purview of scholarly studies, namely, 'footpath pornography', magazines such as Sexology Mirror (in Hindi), women's magazines dealing explicitly with sex and sexuality.
