This thesis was commissioned by UPM-Kymmene Oyj. In first quarter of the year 2013 a Business Controlling Transition Project was conducted in Paper Business Group of UPM-Kymmene Oyj as a result which, it was decided to transfer the responsibility for capital expenditure reporting from Northern Europe region mill sites to the Financial Services. The objective of this thesis study was to develop the capital expenditure re-porting process and reporting tools to support the process for the Paper, Pulp, Energy and Functions Finland team, which will be responsible for the reporting after the transition is completed. The literature for this study relies on the accounting guidelines of UPM-Kymmene Oyj, and on theory about business reporting process re-engineering. Data collection for the study was carried out by studying the existing reporting processes of the company. For the purpose of collecting information, interviews and workshops were conducted with the professionals involved with the capital expenditure reporting and the transition project. These data collection methods were chosen in order to succeed in developing a truly functional reporting process which meets the requirements and objectives set by the commissioning company. This study presents a proposal for the new reporting process. The process has been designed to be harmonious between the reported mill sites, and to assign clear roles and responsibilities. At the same time, duplicate and dispensable tasks have been removed. As a result the end-to-end time of the process should be as short as possible. This is a favourable quality for the existing processes of the Paper, Pulp, Energy and Functions Finland team. The reporting tools developed in this study aim to automatize difficult tasks in the process and decrease the number of mistakes. Further research will be required for certain parts of the reporting process. At least the future responsibilities of project accounting, compilation of the Statistical Key Figures and the internal transfer issue should be re-examined in the next stage. At the request of UPM-Kymmene Oyj, information considered confidential has been removed from the published version of this study.

"All museum activities converge in the public forum of the exhibition - regardless of whether the exhibit is held in the physical museum or is on the Web. Since the first edition of this book in 2002, there has been a world-wide explosion of new galleries and exhibition halls, and new ideas about how exhibitions should look and communicate. The definition of what an exhibition is has changed as exhibitions can now be virtual; non-traditional migratory and pop-up spaces play host to temporary displays; social media has created amazing opportunities for participatory engagement and shifted authority away from experts to the public; and as time-constrained audiences demand more dynamic, interactive, and mobile applications, museum leadership, managers, staff, and designers are rising to these challenges in innovative ways."--Back cover.

This final thesis solves the challenges and problems of the transportation process with special needs. The experience is ammonium sulphate transportation process by Kuljetusliike Kalevi Huhtala Oy. The process needs modified transportation equipment. I approached this problem by my own experience of the process. I also interviewed Kalevi and Kati Huhtala. The ammonium sulphates special needs in transportation process can be seen from the safety data sheet.  All the results could not be seen in the beginning of the process. Some of the problems came up later, when the situation was optimal. The problems differ between transportation processes. It is important to find out the problems soon after the problem existence. The quicker the reaction for the problem is, smaller damages to the process are caused.

Managing the labour process
"In an era of increasingly available digital resources, many textile designers and makers find themselves at an interesting juncture between traditional craft process and newer digital technologies. Highly specialized craft/design practitioners may now elect to make use of digital processes in their work, but often choose not to abandon craft skills fundamental to their practice, and aim to balance the complex connection between craft and digital processes. The essays collected here consider this transition from the viewpoint of aesthetic opportunity arising in the textile designer's hands-on experimentation with material and digital technologies available in the present.Craft provides the foundations for thinking within the design and production of textiles, and as such may provide some clues in the transition to creative and thoughtful use of current and future digital technologies. Within the framework of current challenges relating to sustainable development, globalization, and economic constraints it is important to interrogate and question how we might go about using established and emerging technologies in textiles in a positive manner"--

The aim of the study was to define and describe the problems in Nokia̕s current material managing. Also the focus of the study was to give new ideas and development areas to manage increasing demand to produce small-batch, tailor- made products in the mass production. The study was divided into theoretical and analytical part. The theoretical part concerns general logistics concepts and definitions, which serve as a basis to the actual study. The analytical part concerns processes of the company and the current state of the material management in more detail. In the study the present processes and operations models are described and are defined the targets, which should be reached in efficient material flow management. The study concerns the total lead-time of materials and factors, which form the total lead-time in the production. Finally, developing areas and ideas, which could be used to further develop for material management in the future, were suggested.

The subject of this final thesis is to make a training course delivery process guide from working processes of Wärtsilä Turku Training Centre. The work is commisioned by Wärtsilä and the purpose of the thesis is to create a process guide, which includes definitions, descriptions or/and work instructions of the actions in the process. The processes are also analyzed, and the improvement targets are brought out, if necessary. This thesis includes background information about Wärtsilä, theory information about work processes, process charts, process improvement, and process guides. This thesis introduces Wärtsilä Turku Training Centreś process environment. The process environment consists of internal and external customers, own  employees and the tools used in the process. The process study is made by interviewing employees behind the actions and by exploring old instructions made from the actions of this process. The process study is made by interviewing employees behind the actions ad by exploring old instructions made from the actions of this process. The end result of this thesis is a detailded process guide which is easily accessible and updatable for all the employees involved to the process. As another result of this final thesis the actions that migh need improvement are bought out for further study.
This book analyses higher education from cultural perspectives and also to reflect on the uses of intellectual devices developed in the cultural studies of higher education over the last decades. The first part of the book presents fresh perspectives to integrate cultural studies in higher education with wider societal processes. Professor William G. Tierney speaks about trust and culture in higher education, whereas Professor Imanol Ordorika opens a political perspective to higher education institutions. The second part of the book studies the internal life of higher education. Relying on a variety of cultural perspectives, the chapters explore the actual day-to-day practices taking place in higher education, ranging from student socialisation, student consumerism, tensions in combining academic and market-oriented targets in knowledge production to the formation of academic identities in different disciplinary and organisational cultures. The focus in the third part of the book is to use cultural perspectives developed in previous studies on disciplinary and organisational cultures as a framework to understand a variety of processes and reforms taking place at the institutional level of high education. The chapters in this part of the book analyse the Bologna Process, the evolution of scientific fields in American universities, organisational cultures in Chinese post-merger universities, and doctoral education and cooperation with industry.
