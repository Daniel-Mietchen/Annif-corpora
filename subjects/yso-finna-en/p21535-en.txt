Working with disaffected students : why students lose interest in school and what we can do about it
In 1984, a longitudinal study was launched at the University of Notre Dame to evaluate the social and psychological consequences of teenage parenting. Interwoven Lives (Erlbaum) described, in detail, the development of these adolescent mothers and their children across the first eight years of life. Major delays were first noticed in children;s patterns of attachment at age 1 and their IQ and personal adjustment scores at age 3. By age 8, school-related problems were found in 70% of the children. With these data as the backdrop, this companion volume, Risk and Resilience, identifies major risk factors associated with long-term developmental delays as well as the processes that led to resilience in some of the mothers and children. This new volume traces the children's development at ages 8, 10, and 14. The editors focus on identifying risk and protective factors associated with important life course trajectories as the mothers entered early adulthood and their children became adolescents. Relatively unexplored protective factors; such as religiosity, patterns of father involvement, and romantic relationships; were found to positively influence development for both teenage mothers and their children. This new text also addresses: new methodological approaches with an emphasis on the use of hierarchical linear and structural equation modeling and dynamical systems analyses; implications for strengthening prevention and intervention programs; intellectual, educational, and socioemotional outcome data on the participants; the dark side of rearing children in poverty; the multiple risks related to adolescent parenting and their profound impact on children's development and how resilience emerges in children's lives and the specific factors that promote it. Risk and Resilience appeals to researchers in developmental psychology and family processes as well as agency and government professionals charged with public policy and service delivery.
"Based on the views of teenagers across Europe and in the Far East, this book argues that we need to reconsider how we judge schools and what they are for. It shows that the treatment of pupils in schools makes more difference to teenagers views on society, and on what it means to be fair, than it does to differences in attainment"--Provided by publisher.

Intervention with children
What is it that makes some children bully and some become victims? What can you do if despite your best efforts, a child keeps on taunting another? What steps can you take before communicating with parents and what will you say? The practice of bullying endures in all schools today. Despite the implementation of bullying policies, parents and staff can be equally perplexed: not really understanding what they have or haven't done to allow it to happen. Christine Macintyre explores this highly emotive topic, asking why as many as one in 12 school children are bullying victims, and will show in a highly practical way, what can be done to support the children and help staff improve their own practice. This book will provide help and guidance on: enhancing the self-esteem of the affected children, showing how new-found confidence will enable children to offset the effects of being bullied or indeed being a bully; how to tell parents their child is bullying or being bullied, and how to build up a meaningful and mutually supportive relationship with them; and, creating a learning environment that prevents the desire for children to bully. Based on case studies giving first hand accounts of real-life situations, and evaluations of strategies that have been tried and tested, this book suggests fresh and inspiring ways of tackling a problem faced by many practitioners today.
