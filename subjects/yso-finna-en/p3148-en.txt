"The subject related to surface chemistry is recognized as being an important area of a special branch of chemistry in everyday life. Due to the extensive literature devoted to this subject, it was realized that a book comprising only essential coverage would be useful. Thus, the aim of this book is to present and describe the essential details of surface chemistry. This need also arises from the fact that the area of applications in industry of this science is now extensive. Most science students are taught physicochemical principles pertaining to gases, liquids, and solids. The matter around us is recognized to be made of these three states of matter. However, in university chemistry textbooks, only a chapter or two is devoted to the science of surface and colloid chemistry. At technical schools the case is the same; in general, it is the case worldwide. However, in the realm of applications of physicochemical in technology, the science of surface and colloid chemistry is one of the most important. The most common examples include Soap bubbles Foam (fire fighting) Raindrops Combustion engines Food products (milk, cheese) Air pollution (fog, smog, sandstorms) Wastewater treatment Washing and cleaning Corrosion Cosmetics Paint and printing; adhesion; friction Oil and gas production, and shale oil/gas recovery (fracking process) Oil spills Plastics and polymers Biology and pharmaceuticals Milk products"--
