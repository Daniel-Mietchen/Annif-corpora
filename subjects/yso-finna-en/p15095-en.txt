With approximately 1 in 6 adults likely to experience a significant mental health problem at any one time (Office for National Statistics), research into effective interventions has never been more important. During the past decade there has been an increasing interest in the role that sport and physical activity can play in the treatment of mental health problems, and in mental health promotion. The benefits resulting from physiological changes during exercise are well documented, including improvement in mood and control of anxiety and depression. Research also suggests that socio-cultural and psychological changes arising from engagement in sport and physical activity carry valuable mental health benefits. Sport and Physical Activity for Mental Health is an evidence-based practical guide for nurses, allied health professionals, social workers, physical activity leaders, and sport coaches. The authors provide comprehensive analysis of a broad range of client narratives, integrating theory and the latest research to explore the effectiveness of various interventions. The book offers readers detailed recommendations, suggestions, and ideas as to how sport and physical activity opportunities can be tailored to provide the greatest mental health benefits.

It is now widely accepted that there are important links between inactivity and lifestyle-related chronic diseases, and that exercise can bring tangible therapeutic benefits to people with long-term chronic conditions. Exercise and Chronic Disease: An Evidence-Based Approach offers a survey of the scientific and clinical evidence underlying the effects of exercise in relation to functional outcomes, disease-specific health-related outcomes and quality of life in patients with chronic disease conditions. Drawing on data from randomized controlled trials and observational evidence, and written by a team of leading international researchers and medical and health practitioners, the book explores the evidence across a wide range of chronic diseases, including: cancer heart disease stroke diabetes parkinson's disease multiple sclerosis asthma. Each chapter addresses the frequency, intensity, duration and modality of exercise that might be employed as an intervention for each condition and, importantly, assesses the impact of exercise interventions in relation to outcomes that reflect tangible benefits to patients.

The authors of The Healthy Heart Book have combined their backgrounds and extensive experience in physiotherapy and nutrition to provide this comprehensive guide to achieving a full recovery. The book covers the current recovery programme information given to patients and builds upon it to provide a thorough understanding of what to do and the reasons for doing it.
