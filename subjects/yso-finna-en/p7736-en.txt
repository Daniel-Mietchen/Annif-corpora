The teaching notes and reproducible handouts and worksheets used for over two decades by hundreds of thousands of practitioners have been significantly revised and expanded to reflect important research and clinical advances. The book gives complete instructions for orienting individuals with a wide range of problems to DBT and teaching them mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills.
