The goal of this thesis was to create an online flea market for Data Media Gazelle, a digital agency located in Turku. The purpose of the website was to create an environment where users could place ads for the items they wished to sell. Administrators could control the categorization and the user-generated ads. The website was created with CakePHP, a web application framework. The core elements of the project were ad creation, categorization, navigation and administrator actions. These elements were implemented by using different CakePHP components, helpers, functions and methods. Different web technologies are explained at the start of this thesis. After that some of the different PHP frameworks are introduced briefly and some comparisons are made. The CakePHP framework is examined more thoroughly, including aspects such as model associations and data validation. At the last part of this thesis, the project itself is explored in depth. The database behind the project is explained and different structures of the website will be demonstrated, complete with code examples.
