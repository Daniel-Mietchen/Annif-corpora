The jury and democracy : how jury deliberation promotes civic engagement and political participation
"This book sets forth a new approach to twenty-first-century criminal justice and punishment, an approach that fully involves the community and provides a better way to make our criminal process more transparent and inclusive. Using the prism of the Sixth Amendment community jury trial, this book offers fresh and much-needed ways to incorporate the citizenry into the procedures of criminal justice, thereby resulting in greater investment and satisfaction in the system. It exposes the various challenges the American criminal justice system faces because of its ongoing failure to integrate the community's voice.Ultimately, the people's right to participate in the criminal justice system through the criminal law -- a right that is all too often overlooked -- is essential to truly legitimizing the criminal process and ensuring its democratic nature"--
