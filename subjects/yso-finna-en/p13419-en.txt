The objective of this thesis was to conduct a research in order to find out the level of satisfaction among the employees at several bars in Porvoo. The main research problems and questions of the thesis were to find out what is the level of employee satisfaction, whether the employees find the work environment stimulating, and whether the employees are engaged. It was also to be studied whether employee satisfaction can yield higher customer satisfaction. The empirical data for the research was gathered through a survey. The survey was conducted at the bar locations straight from the staff and it included three background questions, 33 subject-relevant multiple choice questions and eight open-ended questions. The total number of participants in this survey was 31. Due to the style and the nature of the survey, the quantitative research method was used. The result of this study showed that the employees of the company were mostly satisfied about their work although there were also signs of disengagement. Some also felt that the job was slighlty overwhelming as the shifts are mostly during nights. Clearly for most of the employees the best parts of their work were the colleagues, the work spirit, as well as the work itself. The worst parts, most felt, were internal communications, managerial relationships, and rewards. With the results of the study the recommendations were following. The company should provide better internal communications as well as a fair and equal work environment. The managerial relationships were also to be looked into to make them more enjoyable and understandable to the employees. Also what the employees wished for was more rewards in ways of simple thank-yous and other oral acknowledgements.

"Culture is the key to success in a 21st century organization-not simply because it affects how we think and behave, but because it's the set of agreements and behaviors that drive how we act in groups and the decisions we collectively make. But every organization now faces the moment it can't ignore as new forms of work, communication and technology wreak havoc on "the way we do things around here." When a traditional structure can morph into a culturally-attuned and culturally-aligned organization, it can become superconducting: everything works better, more smoothly, faster. In The Moment You Can't Ignore, Malachi O'Connor and Barry Dornfeld provide powerful insights on how to confront the clash of old and new so that the people and businesses can successfully meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.They show how to ask the big questions that point the way to renewing a culture: Who are we? What do we stand for, and what's the connection between our identity and the strategic commitments we make?" When people in a company are uncertain of its identity, they have a hard time executing on any strategy with real passion or commitment. Who's in charge? In many organizations it's unclear who's in charge of any given initiative at any given time. The person with the title may need to cede authority to the person with greater expertise. Or the maverick leader of an innovative project team may actually have more sway than the boss. When people don't know how to determine who's in charge, or when and how to shift authority from one person to another, the uncertainty can be paralyzing. How do I lead? Senior leaders may have positional and formal authority, but find they have a difficult time attracting followers.To get people on board with their ideas and initiatives, they can no longer simply order people to follow them. Even leaders in traditional command-and-control hierarchies sense they have to move to a different leadership style, but can't fully adjust to a world of command and collaboration. What's our future? When people don't know who's in charge, are unsure of what their company identity is, and can't get behind their leaders, they rarely have the ability or will to innovate. Old ideas get rehashed. New ideas get squashed or lost. Initiatives that are designed to create an "innovation culture" or spur creativity go nowhere. "--

How to Reduce Attrition in Company X?
The objective of this research was to evaluate Nokia's International Employer Brand during the fall of 2012. Recently, the mobile industry has faced intensive competition in terms of recruitment for the best talent. Nokia has faced some difficulties, such as losing its market leadership and facing some remarkable financial turbulence. In February 2011, the company announced a new strategy and since then Nokia's situation has changed dramatically. On June 14, 2012 a reshaped strategy was announced, and this has affected 10,000 employees worldwide. This study evaluated the perception of Nokia' employer brand based on the opinions of different groups (former employees, people working for Nokia and people who have never worked for Nokia). First, the study explores the importance of employer brand categories and attributes. Moreover, the study evaluates Nokia's performance. The study describes the gap between people's expectations and Nokia's offering. The attributes of the employer brand were created based on previous theoretical models adapted to Nokia's situation. The data was collected in September 2012 using an online survey which was sent to the respondents using different social media channels. In total, 216 people from 34 different countries answered the survey. It was found that Nokia's employer brand consists of eight categories and Nokia's overall employer brand remains good. There are some differences in terms of perception depending on respondents' relation to the company. Former employees' perceptions are more negative than those of other groups. The employees' perception is from neutral to positive. Outsiders' perception is the most positive one. Nokia weakest performance was related to leadership and management, HR processes and development opportunities.

Abstract: The purpose of the thesis was to identify if there are less known factors affecting employees' willingness to adopt a new IM tool, in this case CRM. It is obvious the tool itself can always be improved but it may not explain all the reluctance usually involved in adoption of such IM implementations. This thesis researched the problem in a technology company WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Corporation focusing on Ship Power business. It is quite common that the implementation of CRM fails, which is confirmed by numerous examples in CRM literature. CRM is a change management project and therefore both change management and internal marketing were investigated as a part of the research. First 5 in-depth interviews were conducted in Ship Power to be able to define which elements seem to discourage the adoption of CRM most. The interviews gave ideas how quantitative research questions could be phrased concerning technology, processes and leadership. E-questionnaire was sent to 76 respondents based on stratified sample. 46 responses were received. The results revealed that despite recognizing CRM a good tool in WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Ship Power there are still some developments to be made on technology. Managers' commitment seems to be on a good level, but there are still some defects in the leadership, which should be tackled. It is evident that employee commitment is a significant factor for successful CRM implementation. Mere technology, however advanced it is, cannot guarantee the success. Consequently affective commitment to change of the employees is worth of pursuing.

In the growing markets of today and excess variety of choice to customers, it is significant to companies to know how to maintain their clientele. The purpose of this thesis was to identify the key elements of customer loyalty. The case company Liikuntakeskus Hukka is a large and popular health club situated in Oulu, Finland. The health club wishes to develop its services in order to maintain the number of the existing male members with improved service. The initial interest towards this case company began with the author but the subject for the thesis was suggested by the case company as important and current information to the company could be gathered from the research. The objective was to approach both existing and former male members to determine the reasons why they joined the health club; which needs were or were not satisfied; most and least important factors at the health club among the facilities, and sports and healthcare possibilities; and what were the main causes to resign the contract. According to the researched data, different segments were identified in the male members and conclusions on how to serve these segments better were drawn. This thesis aimed to explain the importance of customer service and customer satisfaction to customer loyalty of a business, as well as considering the theories of consumer behaviour and customer relationship management. Quantitative research was used in the empirical part to gather enough data for reliable results in the form of a multiple-choice questionnaire sent by e-mail. Mainly closed questions were used to gain comparable answer with a few open-ended questions for receiving more precise feedback for the client company. Discussion of the theoretical part was based on printed and online publications. The results were analysed and managerial implications were suggested to the case company in accordance with results. The main segments in male members were identified, and the strongest aspects and the key weaknesses of the health club were recognised by the survey. Health Club Hukka has a strong customer base of members since many years that are very loyal to the club mainly because of the variety of services offered and the atmosphere shared with friends.
