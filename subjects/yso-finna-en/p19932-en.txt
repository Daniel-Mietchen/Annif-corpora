Summary: During an investigation on Betula species in northern Finland it was found that in a seed sample collected from one tree (B. pubescens subsp. tortuosa) in 1978, the frequency of twin seedlings was ca. 28 percent. In seed material from the same tree in 1979, the corresponding value was about 1.5 percent...

Despite the development of assisted reproduction technologies and significant advances in reproductive biology and medicine over the years the cause of infertility remains unexplained in 10–20% of cases. The cause of infertility in these cases may be connected to problems in fertilization or implantation and genetic factors may play a part in this.The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte and early-stage embryos. It is important for folliculogenesis, fertilization and implantation. In humans, it is composed of four known ZP glycoproteins that all show varying degrees of structural and functional roles in reproduction. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zona pellucida genes in cases of total fertilization failure and zona anomalies, and to study their expression in human fetal and adult ovaries.A total of 34 sequence variations were detected in genes expressing the four human ZP proteins (ZP1–ZP4) among women with fertilization failure and those with varying degrees of zona anomalies in their oocytes. Most of the variations were known single nucleotide polymorphisms, while three were novel findings. Women with fertilization failure had a higher mean number of sequence variations in ZP1 and ZP3 when compared with controls. Some of the most frequent zona anomalies may be at least partly explained by sequence variations in ZP1–ZP4 genes.In fetal life, the expression of ZP3 protein and mRNA could already be detected as early as at the 11th week of gestation and it peaked at the 20th week, the time of primordial follicle formation. This suggests that components needed for zona matrix are already present well before the formation of the zona pellucida and may have a role in the development of primordial follicles. Expression of the transcription factor FIGLA (factor in the germline alpha) was increased at around the 20thweek of gestation, supporting previous findings of its critical role in the initiation of folliculogenesis and primordial follicle formation.The present study adds to our knowledge on the currently still incomplete picture of formation of the ZP and fertilization in humans. Understanding the genetic background of infertile patients may help us to develop new tools not only to evaluate but also to improve their fertilization potential, and to choose the optimal treatment to achieve pregnancy.
The main goal of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment is a healthy mother and a healthy child. The most important complication following IVF/ICSI arises from the increased risk of multiple pregnancies. An elective single embryo transfer (eSET) with the freezing of spare embryos and subsequent treatment with frozen embryo transfer (FET) is the only way to avoid this complication. For this reason, the number of children born after FET is steadily rising.The aim of this study was to provide more detailed evidence on the safety of FET, particularly focusing on serum hormone profiles during the first trimester weeks of singleton pregnancies after IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET), after FET during a natural menstrual cycle, and after spontaneous conception. Another part of this study compared the perinatal outcomes, congenital anomalies (CAs), and morbidity of singletons born after FET and IVF/ICSI fresh ET. The reference group was those born after spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies.In the clinical prospective study, the maternal serum estradiol and progesterone levels in pregnancies after fresh ET (n=39) were higher during early pregnancy weeks than in FET (n=30) and SC pregnancies (n=41), while the hormonal profiles after FET did not differ from SC pregnancies. In the large register study, FET children (n=1830) were found to have a reduced risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, a low birthweight, and being small for their gestational age compared with children born after fresh ET (n=2942). However, FET children have an increased risk for being large for their gestational age. The major CAs and morbidity until three years of age did not differ between groups. When compared with SC children (n =31 243), the perinatal outcome was worse and the rates of CAs and morbidity were higher in FET children.The FET cycle seemed to provide a better physiological environment for early fetal development than fresh ET. Further, FET protects against some of the adverse perinatal outcomes of children when compared with fresh ET, but not when it comes to the major CAs and early somatic health.This study provides further evidence of the safety of FET in comparison with fresh ET. This information should further encourage clinicians to implement eSET combined with cryopreservation in their IVF/ICSI program.
