Painting the potential [of] working life education and development services offered by the Finnish Innovation University
By exploring a normative model of universities as institutions with a responsibility to contribute to the public good, this book addresses the leadership, management and public policy challenges of maximizing higher education’s contribution to civil society. It codifies the extensive academic literature in this field and reviews higher education and other public policies that both drive and inhibit civic engagement both globally and locally. Comparing experiences and reports of an institutional developmental process undertaken in eight distinctive universities in four European countries and guided by the editors the book explores key questions such as: what is the Civic University, and how can we use this concept to understand higher education’s engagement with the outside world in varying institutional and geographical contexts? What are the appropriate internal structures and mechanisms required for a university to effectively encourage and support civic engagement activity for the greatest societal impact? How can embedding civic engagement in individual institutions and wider systems be facilitated by changes in higher education and related policies at the sub-national, national and European level? Succinct and discerning, The Civic University will be of great interest to academics working in the fields of higher education, science and innovation studies and community and city development. It will also appeal to university leaders and organisers of institutional leadership development programmes along with city leaders and policy makers at national and international levels.

Yearbook 2012-13
This innovative book addresses the leadership and management challenges of maximising the contribution of universities to civil society both locally and globally. It does this by developing a model of the civic university as an academic concept, drawing out practical lessons for university management on how to embed civic engagement in the heartland of the university. To this end, the contributors compare experiences and reports on a developmental process in eight institutions: University College London and Newcastle University in the UK, Amsterdam and Groningen Universities in the Netherlands, Aalto and Tampere Universities in Finland and Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology in Ireland. It will be of interest to academics of politics, public policy and management studies, as well as having relevance to policymakers in the field.
