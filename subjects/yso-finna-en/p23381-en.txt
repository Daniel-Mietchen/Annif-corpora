This Bachelor's thesis was executed as a project. The purpose was to create a booklet which would explain in a simplistic way what bloodless surgery encompasses and the type of care and patient teaching required by the nurse. The objective of this project was to inform future nursing students of the possibilities of bloodless medicine and to introduce them to the field. In this way they can be prepared for working life in case they meet the patient requesting this type of care since this is an ever growing field. The theoretical basis for this thesis was bloodless surgical techniques and what the nurse should keep in mind. The theory section was written in English as well as the booklet. The topic was carried out by researching bloodless medicine as a whole; the procedures, the care given, and the outcomes. A benefit to risk comparison was executed so that a nurse can effectively teach the patient what could be expected from this type of operation. Further research options could include a closer examination of one or more of the phases of bloodless surgery, e.g. pre-operative, intra-operative or postoperative patient care.
