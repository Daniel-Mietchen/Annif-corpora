"Preface We are proud to present this book as an attempt to bridge different areas that constitute the field of biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS), often called biomicrosystems. The field of BioMEMS has been growing rapidly since the early 1990s due to the advancements in microtechnologies that could cater to the vast application requirements of bio areas. The potential of BioMEMS suits this technology for many applications, including clinical and environmental diagnostics, drug delivery, agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, chemical synthesis, etc. It is foreseen that BioMEMS will have a deep impact on many aspects of the life science operations and functionalities in the near future. Scientists and students that work in the field of BioMEMS will need to have knowledge and skills at the interface between engineering and biosciences. Development of a BioMEMS device usually involves many scientists and students from various disciplines, such as biosciences, medicine, biochemistry, engineering, physics, etc. One could anticipate many communication and understanding issues that would arise among these people with varied expertise and training. The methods, details, and languages of training are quite different for the students and researchers of engineering and biosciences. As a result, researchers and students involved with multidisciplinary projects like BioMEMS undergo an interesting and refreshing learning on multidisciplinary subjects along the project development. This book aims to support and expedite the multidisciplinary learning involved with the development of biomicrosystems, from both bioscience and engineering perspectives"--Provided by publisher.

"As technological advancements widen the scope of applications for biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS or biomicrosystems), the field continues to have an impact on many aspects of life science operations and functionalities. Because BioMEMS research and development require the input of experts who use different technical languages and come from varying disciplines and backgrounds, scientists and students can avoid potential difficulties in communication and understanding only if they possess a skill set and understanding that enables them to work at the interface of engineering and biosciences.Keeping this duality in mind throughout, BioMEMS: Science and Engineering Perspectives supports and expedites the multidisciplinary learning involved in the development of biomicrosystems. Divided into nine chapters, it starts with a balanced introduction of biological, engineering, application, and commercialization aspects of the field. With a focus on molecules of biological interest, the book explores the building blocks of cells and viruses, as well as molecules that form the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), linkers, and hydrogels used for making different surfaces biocompatible through functionalization. The book also discusses: Different materials and platforms used to develop biomicrosystems Various biological entities and pathogens (in ascending order of complexity) The multidisciplinary aspects of engineering bioactive surfaces Engineering perspectives, including methods of manufacturing bioactive surfaces and devices Microfluidics modeling and experimentation Device level implementation of BioMEMS concepts for different applications. Because BioMEMS is an application-driven field, the book also highlights the concepts of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro total analysis system (oÌTAS), along with their pertinence to the emerging point-of-care (POC) and point-of-need (PON) applications"--Provided by publisher.

Negotiating bioethics : the governance of UNESCO's Bioethics Programme
This is a new methodology in health care. Recently, health care policymakers and practitioners have recognised the potential contribution of qualitative research to support decision making. Different methodological approaches have been developed and used in practice. Some approaches have focused on the inclusion of qualitative data only. Others have experimented with the integration of both quantitative and qualitative research results, or have been used to complement results from quantitative reviews. This book provides the first overview of commonly used qualitative synthesis approaches in health care, with worked examples illustrating how appropriate methods are used in different situations. The methods covered include: Meta-aggregation; Meta-ethnography; Critical interpretive synthesis; Realist review; Mixed methods approach; and, Bayesian approaches to the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative research findings. Written by experienced researchers from three continents, "Synthesising Qualitative Research" is an authoritative yet accessible introduction to these new methodologies and will be an invaluable tool to all who are involved in systematic reviewing. It aims to guide and assist researchers and professionals in choosing the right approach for their particular review projects.

"The Nanobiomaterials Handbook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of nanobiomaterials with a broad introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the subject and as a useful reference for advanced professionals. Nanobiomaterials are poised to play a central role in nanobiotechnology and make significant contributions to biomedical research and health care. This assessment is based on numerous demonstrations that nanobiomaterials can exhibit distinctive nanoscopic characteristics (e.g., mechanical, electrical, and optical properties) suitable for a variety of biological applications. Advances in nanobiomaterials require a multidisciplinary approach spanning fields in physical sciences (e.g., chemistry), biological sciences (e.g., molecular biology), engineering (e.g., chemical engineering), and medicine with considerable interaction and collaboration among ethicists, regulatory bodies, and industry. The introduction defines the field of nanobiomaterials and discusses its scope, current status, and future prospects. This is followed by an in-depth survey of nanobiomaterials. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the various synthesis and processing techniques important for developing bionanomaterials and explores the unique nanoscopic physicochemical properties of nanobiomaterials. Next, a detailed survey of potential applications of nanobiomaterials is presented. Here the emphasis is on the unique challenges in the design, fabrication, and evaluation of biomaterials for a particular application/field. For instance, key physical properties necessary for developing bionanomaterials for molecular imaging applications are completely different than those for gene therapy"--Provided by publisher.

Jeffrey Lockhart's father, Ross, is a billionaire in his sixties, with a younger wife, Artis Martineau, whose health is failing. Ross is the primary investor in a remote and secret compound where death is exquisitely controlled and bodies are preserved until a future time when biomedical advances and new technologies can return them to a life of transcendent promise. Jeff joins Ross and Artis at the compound to say "an uncertain farewell" to her as she surrenders her body. "We are born without choosing to be. Should we have to die in the same manner? Isn't it a human glory to refuse to accept a certain fate?" These are the questions that haunt the novel and its memorable characters, and it is Ross Lockhart, most particularly, who feels a deep need to enter another dimension and awake to a new world. For his son, this is indefensible. Jeff, the book's narrator, is committed to living, to experiencing "the mingled astonishments of our time, here, on earth." Don DeLillo's seductive, spectacularly observed and brilliant new novel weighs the darkness of the world-terrorism, floods, fires, famine, plague-against the beauty and humanity of everyday life; love, awe, "the intimate touch of earth and sun."
