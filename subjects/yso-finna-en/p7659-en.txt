Liaohe River is one of the seven biggest rivers in China. It is facing to river road stop;  water pollution and deterioration of ecological environment etc. in a series of problems. Liaohe River watershed is one of the important bases of operations for agriculture and the most economically developed regions in Northeast of China. It is also the contradiction between eater supplies and demands the most prominent areas in Liaoning Province.  The aim of this thesis is to analyse reasons of Liaohe River water quality changes in nearly ten years. Basically from several parts to take a look what cause of pollution and how to control and improve the water quality of Liaohe River. In Shenyang section area, environment protection agency has done some works to improved Liaohe River water quality for urban living and agriculture using. From this thesis will be basically to understand the idea of improvement of Liaohe River. Liaoning government and Shenyang environment protection agency has measured base on COD, CODMn (or CODCr), BOD, Ammonia-nitrogen and TP etc. those main pollutants in Liaohe River and reported. Base on these main pollutants to analysis the water resources quality of Liaohe River.

As the development of economy, the contradiction between the ecological environment and natural resources on the one hand and economic and social development on the other is becoming increasingly conspicuous. The problem of water environment is particularly severe, the pollution of water becoming one of the greatest problems. Public participation mechanism has already become an inevitable tool to be introduced into governments' environmental Acts and Policies to resolve the confrontations. This paper compares some of the practices in developed countries, with those of China. It is apparent that the country has still a long way to go in certain areas of environmental protection lawmaking. At present, there are only general rules about public participating environment protection in Chinese environment protection laws, and lack of a practical channel of public participation. This is shown upon analyzing some successful oversea cases and domestic cases with water pollution treatment in which the practice proves that public participation and building NGOs is one of the important factors. Eventually, through analyzing the cases with River Wei protection, this paper figures out the urgency and importance of public participation in the water environmental protection and suggests that government has to establish and develop more canonical and perfect public participation mechanism to resolve the water environment conflicts.
Approximately 77 percent of the freshwater used in the United States comes from surface-water sources and is subject to natural organic matter contamination according to the United States Geological Survey. This presents a distinct challenge to water treatment engineers. An essential resource to the latest breakthroughs in the characterization, treatment and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water, Natural Organic Matter in Waters: Characterization and Treatment Methods focuses on advance filtration and treatment options, and processes for reducing disinfection byproducts. Based on the authors years of research and field experience, this book begins with the characterization of NOM including: general parameters, isolation and concentration, fractionation, composition and structural analysis and biological testing. This is followed by removal methods such as inorganic coagulants, polyelectrolytes and composite coagulants. Electrochemical and membranes removal methods such as: electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and membrane fouling.
