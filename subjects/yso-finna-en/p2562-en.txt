Developing clean technologies is no longer a social issue championed by environmentalists; it's a moneymaking enterprise moving solidly into the business mainstream. In fact, as the economy faces unprecedented challenges from high energy prices, resource shortages, and global environmental and security threats, clean tech--technologies designed to provide superior performance at a lower cost while creating significantly less waste than conventional offerings--promises to be the next engine of economic growth. Here, authors Pernick and Wilder identify the major forces that have pushed clean tech from utopian dream to a revolution in corporate boardrooms, on Wall Street trading floors, and in government offices around the globe. By highlighting eight major clean-tech sectors--solar energy, wind power, biofuels and biomaterials, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration--they uncover how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from this next wave of technological innovation.--From publisher description.
