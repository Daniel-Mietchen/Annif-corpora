Motivational dynamics in the learning context : interaction of individual and situational factors
To interact with the environment, an individual must code, store and translate spatial information into the appropriate motor commands. Working from this premise, this new book discusses how visual perception, attention and memory are linked to the processes of movement. As a resource for motor control and motor learning researchers, students, educators and clinicians, this book offers comprehensive coverage of current literature on the visual control of goal-directed movement. The book also presents a systematic explication of the sensory and physiological processes and systems responsible for fast, accurate and efficient performance. The final part of the text provides a review of recent research on how and why limb control changes occur with practice and development. In addition, the book considers how the research presented can maximise precision, efficiency and safety in workspace design.

Examination of Goal Orientation, Sense of Coherence, and Motivational Climate as predictors of Perceived Physical Competence
Helping clients determine their priorities, set goals, make decisions, and take action to improve their lives are common tasks for virtually all helping professionals when engaging with clients. This is the process known as "values clarification" (or "Values Clarification"). While counselors and psychotherapists widely practice values clarification-some knowingly, others unaware - they typically do so with a limited understanding of its theory, methods, and various applications. This work meets a long-standing need in the helping professions by being the first and only comprehensive book on how counselors and psychotherapists can work with clients around values, goal-setting, decision-making and action planning.
