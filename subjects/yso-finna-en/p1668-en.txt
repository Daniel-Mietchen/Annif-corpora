Until recently, the most important revenue generating factor in the telecommunication industry was the product as a box itself. This sector is going through major changes, which resulted in the unbundling of products and services. As the services business grows, it becomes the main revenue generating item, and telecommunication companies become software and services companies. Telecommunications services are based on software based solutions, and software needs continuous care, namely software maintenance.    The scope of this thesis is software business, more closely it deals with software maintenance budget planning. The starting point of the study was the following: the software update revenue – earned by the sponsor company - needs to be split up between the different software maintenance programs in a more efficient way, hence improving the budget planning of these programs. The study has three objectives: overviewing the way software business is approached by the sponsor company, finding relevant parameters to help more accurate software maintenance program budgeting, and analyzing the relationship between software update sales and problem ticket reporting.    First, the study overviews the relevant literature of products, services and software maintenance. Then it overviews the sponsor company's approach to software business. After this, the methodology of the study is presented. This means the investigation software maintenance programs of the sponsor company in order to find relevant parameters for budgeting. It is achieved by collecting evidence from various sources. The rest of the thesis presents and summarizes the findings, discusses the quality of the report and gives recommendations for future research.    The results of the study are the following. First, the report presents a summary of the SW Business approach at the sponsor company, which can be used as a compact self-study material on the topic. Further results are the relevant parameters for software maintenance program budgeting, as follows: installed base information, product characteristics, new vs. mature technologies, low cost vs. high cost locations, and different cost structures of the ex-companies. The study also presents a general formula for SW Update cost calculation in a global organization. Taken into consideration these result help a better budget planning for software maintenance programs.
