Adequate oxygen supply is necessary for aerobic cell survival. Cellular oxygen deprivation, also known as hypoxia, leads to various responses that aim to increase cellular oxygen delivery and reduce oxygen consumption. Oxygen homeostasis is mainly regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which regulates the expression of over 300 genes in response to hypoxia. The stability of HIF is regulated by the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs), enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of proline residues in HIFα subunits and target them towards proteasomal degradation. HIF-P4Hs require oxygen as a cosubstrate for the reaction, allowing for hypoxic HIF stabilization and target gene induction at low oxygen concentrations.In this study we investigated the role of HIF-P4H-2 in the regulation of red blood cell production, erythropoiesis. We showed that Tibetans living at high altitude have genetically adapted to their hypoxic environment via mutations in the gene encoding for HIF-P4H-2. The Tibetan HIF-P4H-2 D4E,C127S variant showed enhanced hydroxylation of HIFα at low oxygen concentrations, resulting in reduced HIFα protein stabilization under hypoxia.In other studies we used a genetically modified HIF-P4H-2 hypomorphic mouse line which expresses a reduced amount of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA in tissues. We showed that these mice develop mild age-dependent erythrocytosis due to splenic extramedullary erythropoiesis, which is independent of serum erythropoietin concentration. In addition, these mice were protected against inflammation-induced anemia, a condition commonly seen in patients with inflammatory diseases. The HIF-P4H-2 hypomorphic mice also had altered basal metabolism in their skeletal muscles, which, together with an increase in mean capillary area, reduced their infarct size after skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury.These studies suggest that pharmacological HIF-P4H-2 inhibition may provide a novel treatment for EPO-resistant anemias and peripheral artery disease.

Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying numerous diseases of the central nervous system is of paramount importance to develop effective therapies and pharmaceutical agents. Cell to cell signal transduction lies within the foundation of healthy physiological function as well as countless disorders. Cellular signaling pathways traditionally initiate at the plasma membrane receptors capable of relaying an extracellular signal to the intracellular environment allowing a rapid response. In the last decade a specific transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor, GPR17, has been associated with such diseases as ischemia, multiple sclerosis and glioblastoma. It was demonstrated to have a degenerative effect on neuronal cells and a stimulating effect on white blood cells and myelin-producing cells of the brain. Yet, remarkably little is known about the precise pathway of its signaling. In this study attempts were made to unravel whether GPR17 receptor causes changes to normal function of essential cellular organelle, mitochondrion.   The effect of GPR17 on mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring the changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels generated and tightly regulated within mitochondria. The ROS levels were analyzed by staining GPR17-transfected cells with a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye. The fluorescence intensity was measured with a high-throughput microplate reader based technique.   This work established a connection between GPR17 receptor and mitochondrial ROS. The results demonstrate that activation of GPR17 with its effective agonist at normal and oxidative stress conditions leads to elevated ROS levels that contribute to cellular damage. It was shown that inhibition of GPR17 with its antagonist prevents generation of high ROS levels and its detrimental effects. It was concluded that targeting GPR17 with clinical antagonist drugs can alleviate ischemic injury to mitochondria. Furthermore, it was observed that GPR17 signalling pathway engages complex I of mitochondrial electron transport chain for signal transduction. Our work provides novel insights into GPR17 signalling pathway. Further research is required to validate our findings and discover yet unknown links in the biochemical chain of GPR17 signalling pathway. Keywords: GPR17, GPCR, mitochondria, signalling pathway, ischemia.
