"Song publishing is the one constant in the carousel of recorded music now spanning the past century, and has been the way that song-credits and publishing revenue have caused ructions and recriminations, and inspired writers by making them poor and lawyers rich. Whether it be Procul Harum going to court to decide who really wrote 'Whiter Shade of Pale' or the Moody Blues wanting their fair share of 'Nights of White Satin', when the song-credits get divvied up, a parting of the ways citing 'musical differences' is almost inevitable. So here are some choice examples of poplore held up to the light, some familiar to music fans others not, designed to prove that Dylan knew of what he wrote when he suggested, 'Money doesn't talk, it swears'. Between them, they provide the unvarnished story of popular song from the days jukeboxes and radio replaced wax cylinders and piano rolls to the era of digital downloads, legal and illegal..."--Publisher's description.

The paper examines the impact of American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listings on   the return of underlying Russian stocks.The contribution of this   paper is twofold.First, it looks at a new sample of ADRs issued by Russian companies.Second, the technique used to estimate the market model is different from the previous studies.The returns are modeled to follow a GARCH process, as opposed to the usual OLS procedure, which assumes homoscedasticity in   residual returns.Average abnormal returns and cumulative average abnormal returns are calculated for the [-25, +25] event window, with the ADR listing date being the event date.The results indicate a significant negative abnormal local market return on an ADR listing day.Return volatilities after the listing are compared to those before the listing. Eleven out of sixteen companies experienced increased volatility of local returns after cross-listing .
