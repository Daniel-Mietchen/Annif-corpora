A population of pool frogs (Pelophylax lessonae) has been discovered in the municipality of Kaarina, southwestern Finland. The species had not previously been recorded from Finland. The frogs show the external characteristics of the northern clade of the species, which suggests that they are of different origin than the allochthonous edible frogs (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) that are also present in southwestern Finland..
