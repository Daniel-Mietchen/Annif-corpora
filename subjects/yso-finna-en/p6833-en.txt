Studies in language and cognition
Horses send out signals continuously about their health, well-being, nutrition and behaviour. The challenge for every horse owner and horse lover is how to interpret these signals and use them. Dutch vets and horse owners Menke Steenbergen and Jan Hulsen have drawn on their expertise and wide experience of horse owners to write Horse Signals: a richly illustrated guide on how to interpret the behaviour, posture and physical characteristics of individual animals and groups. When observing horses it is important not to jump to conclusions immediately, but instead always to ask yourself three questions: What do I see? Why has this happened? What does this mean?

The you code : what your habits say about you
Papers from the eighteenth Finnish Conference of Linguistics
Pointing has captured the interest of scholars from various fields who study communication. However, ideas and findings have been scattered across diverse publications in different disciplines, and opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange have been very limited. The editor's aim is to provide an arena for such exchange by bringing together papers on pointing gestures from disciplines, such as developmental psychology, psycholinguistics, sign-language linguistics, linguistic anthropology, conversational analysis, and primatology. Questions raised by the editors include: Do chimpanzees produce and comprehend pointing gestures in the same way as humans? What are cross-cultural variations of pointing gestures? In what sense are pointing gestures human universal? What is the relationship between the development of pointing and language in children? What linguistic roles do pointing gestures play in signed language? Why do speakers sometimes point to seemingly empty space in front of them during conversation? How do pointing gestures contribute to the unfolding of face-to-face interaction that involves objects in the environment? What are the semiotic processes that relate what is pointed at and what is actually "meant" by the pointing gesture (the relationship between the two are often not as simple as one might think)? Do pointing gestures facilitate the production of accompanying speech?

Gesture and sign language in human-computer interaction : internatinal gesture workshop, GW 2001 London, Uk April 2001
"The way we say the words we say helps us convey our intended meanings. Indeed, the tone of voice we use, the facial expressions and bodily gestures we adopt while we are talking, often add entirely new layers of meaning to those words. How the natural non-verbal properties of utterances interact with linguistic ones is a question that is often largely ignored. This book redresses the balance, providing a unique examination of non-verbal behaviours from a pragmatic perspective. It charts a point of contact between pragmatics, linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, ethology and psychology, and provides the analytical basis to answer some important questions: How are non-verbal behaviours interpreted? What do they convey? How can they be best accommodated within a theory of utterance interpretation?"--Provided by publisher.

Becoming human : from pointing gestures to syntax
As more and more secondary schools and colleges accept American Sign Language (ASL) as a legitimate choice for second language study, Learning to see has become even more vital in guiding instructors on the best way to teach ASL as a second language. And now this groundbreaking book has been updated and revised to reflect the significant gains in recognition that Deaf people and their native language, ASL, have achieved in recent years. Learning to see lays solid groundwork for teaching and studying ASL by outlining the structure of this unique visual language. Myths and misconceptions about ASL are laid to rest at the same time that fascinating, multifaceted elements of Deaf culture are described. Students will be able to study ASL and gain a thorough understanding of the culture it represents, which will help them to grasp the language more easily. An explanation of the linguistic basis of ASL follows, leading into the specific, and above all, practical information on teaching techniques. This practical manual systematically presents the steps necessary to design a curriculum fo teaching ASL, including the special features necessary for training interpreters. The new Learning to see again takes its place at the forefront of texts on teaching ASL as a second language, and it will prove to be indispensable to educators and administrators in this special discipline.

How do today's teenagers talk? What are the distinguishing features of their style of language, and what do they tell us about the English language more generally? Drawing on a huge corpus of examples collected over a fifteen-year period, Sali A. Tagliamonte undertakes a detailed study of adolescents' language and argues that it acts as a "bellwether" for the future of the English language. Teenagers are often accused of "lowering the standards" of the English language by the way they talk and text. From spoken words - "like," "so," "just," and "stuff" - to abbreviated expressions used online, this fascinating book puts young people's language under the microscope, examining and demystifying the origins of new words, and tracking how they vary according to gender, geographical location, and social circumstances. Highly topical and full of new insights, the book is essential reading for anyone interested in how teenagers talk.
