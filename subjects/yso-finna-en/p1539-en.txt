"Care for other human beings is at the heart of ministry and brings ministers in contact with wholeof human life. The focus of this handbook of psychology for pastoral contexts is on psychological insight into human relationships and mental health. It can be read as a whole, or used as a handbook for reference to particular problems. At the same time it attempts to put psychological concepts into everyday language. Jessica Osborne, an experienced psychologist and teacher, discusses areas such as attachment, dependency and anxiety, betrayal and reconciliation, mental health issues, such as depression, eating disorders and addiction, stress, violence and abuse and suffering. The book will be useful on pastoral care courses at all levels and suitable for practitioners and people in training for pastoral ministry - lay or ordained." --Publisher's description.
