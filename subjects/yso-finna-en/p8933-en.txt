Studies of traffic situations using cellular automata
Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

"This book presents an exhaustive compilation of state-of-the-art research and theory into the causes and consequences of behavioral adaptation in road transport/road safety and systems. It brings together earlier and more recent theories on behavioral adaptation, combined with practical advice and methods to minimize the potential impact of behavioral adaptation on the road transport system and road user safety. This text is an essential component of any road safety library, benefiting researchers, practitioners, designers and policy-makers interested in maximizing safety while encouraging innovation and excellence in road transport-related design"--
