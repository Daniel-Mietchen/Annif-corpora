Cleaner and greener technologies are playing an increasing role in global business -- and while there will be costs involved adapting to those technologies, there are also opportunities for business which are capable of commercializing them.From carbon capture to new sources of renewable energy, the overall potential of this shift is enormous, as evidenced by the amount of private capital and public funds looking for clean technologies in which to invest.Clean Tech, Clean Profits is designed as a practical guide for entrepreneurs, innovators and investors on how to bring clean technologies to market in the most effective and profitable manner. It covers topics such as funding clean tech, renewable power generation, clean energy in emerging economies, intellectual property for clean tech, geo-engineering, the shift to low carbon vehicles, waste management, technology challenges, innovation opportunities, and wind, marine, solar and biomass energy.Emphasizing the specific steps that can be taken now in reviewing options, drawing up plans, upgrading a process, writing a specification, or making an investment, this book is ideal for leaders of organizations who want to move ahead of their competitors and offer new sources of value to their customer"--
