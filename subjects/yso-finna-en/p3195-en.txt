The legal concept of amnesty is not only conceptual, but also objectively in ancient traditions there are comparable activities available from all periods of antiquity. Fifteen renowned authors from Germany, the UK and Austria, all experts in various fields and eras of antiquity, present their contributions in this volume. They treat the subject each from their own perspective - either in the form of special studies of exemplary cases or in broad overview presentations. It is important to note that all categories of written sources and literary tradition, legal writings, inscriptions and papyri, have been incorporated into the analysis. This created the conditions for the first time in the history of research, to provide an overall look at issues of amnesty and parole from the ancient Near East to late antiquity and to parallels through the centuries.
