"Brain plasticity is the focus of a growing body of research with significant implications for neurorehabilitation. This state-of-the-art volume explores ways in which brain-injured individuals may be helped not only to compensate for their loss of cognitive abilities, but also possibly to restore those abilities. Expert contributors examine the extent to which damaged cortical regions can actually recover and resume previous functions, as well as how intact regions are recruited to take on tasks once mediated by the damaged region. Evidence-based rehabilitation approaches are reviewed for a range of impairments and clinical populations, including both children and adults"--Provided by publisher.
"This book is a comprehensive guide to the evidence, theories, and practical issues associated with recovery from stuttering in early childhood and into adolescence. It examines evidence that stuttering is associated with a range of biological factors such as genetics and psychological factors such as anxiety, and it critically assesses theoretical accounts that attempt to integrate these findings. Written so that it can be used flexibly to meet the demands of courses about stuttering, the book may be used as a text at the undergraduate or graduate level in psychology or speech-language science"--Provided by publisher.

Abstract : The purpose of this thesis was to create an informative package for the managers in the case company to explain the importance of wellbeing at work and describe the symptoms and causes for burn out as well as to hear real-life experiences from burn out recovery process. The study was based on one of the qualitative research methods, narration. The respondents were asked to write a story and narratively describe the causes for burn out, reflect his/her own actions and evaluate the main rehabilitation methods used in the healing process. The goal was to learn what kind of support the employees of the case company would have needed, especially from their managers, during the process.   Wellbeing at work consists of physical, social and psychic wellbeing. The term ''burn out'' stands for a slow exhaustion of personal physical, emotional and cognitive resources. The main symptoms are comprehensive exhaustion, cynical attitude towards work and weakened professional self-confidence. Healthy lifestyle is the basic cure for the condition but there are also several rehabilitation methods provided by the employer or the society to turn to when there are symptoms of burn out. Even though burn out is seen as mainly caused by work, 20 percent of the reasons behind the syndrome can be explained by personal factors. Organizational citizenship behavior, leadership skills of the manager and social support are seen as possible preventive measures for the condition. The narrative study was implemented in the case company in January 2011 and the study analysis was conducted by using deductive content analysis. Among the respondents the main reasons for burn out were excessive amount of work and overtime hours, continuous change in the work environment and for some, no manager to turn to. Also personal problems including sickness in the family combined with elements from the work were seen as causes for burn out. Respondents had been suffering from fatigue, problems to sleep, lack of motivation and cynicism and some also reported having psychosomatic symptoms.  On the grounds of the study results, people dealing with the burn out have individually been playing the key role in the recovery process and they have not quite felt the support needed from their superiors. Sick leave was the most used rehabilitation method. And discussions with the skilled professionals or friends/family members were seen as the most effective rehabilitation methods in the process of overcoming burn out. Nevertheless, better life control seems to be the most efficient way to fully recover from burn out and to improve the quality of life in the long haul.
