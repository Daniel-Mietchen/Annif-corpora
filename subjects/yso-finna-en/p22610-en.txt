Abstract: Supporting Young People's Life Management with Game Technology.
Fun Inc. : why games are the twenty-first century's most serious business
With the fast development of information technology, online games are becoming increasingly mainstream form of entertainment. This thesis is an exploratory study on Chinese online game consumer behaviour trying to understand their behaviour and make out what they need, how they are satisfied and what factors affect their choice. This thesis is sponsored by Baidu Inc. which is the largest online game company in China. The thesis will focus on the following problems: - How do consumers in general make purchase decisions? - How do consumers make online game purchase decisions in China? - What can be concluded on the basis of these findings from the online game company ÃÅs view? This research uses survey to collect information from the online game consumers to find out the decision making process and the factors that affect this process. In the theoretical part of this thesis, the five-stage model, presented as need recognition, searching for information, alternative evaluation, purchase and outcomes, is used as a conceptual framework to analyze the purchase decision making process of consumers in general. It describes the process that how a consumer makes his/her purchase decision. This process is influenced by external and internal factors. Those factors have strong impact on the decision making process. Those factors are considered together with the process. In the empirical part of this thesis, the information collected from the internet survey will be analyzed using the conceptual framework derived from the theoretical part. Online game players recognize need that can't be satisfied in the real world while can be easily fulfilled in online games. They search for game information from internal and external sources. As searching for game information, players evaluate possible alternatives. The purchase occurs after the player makes purchase decision. The evaluation will go on after the purchase. Based on the evaluation after the purchase, the purchase outcome may be satisfaction or dissatisfaction. External and internal factors have strong impact on this process. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on the basis of the former discussion. It shows that the Chinese online game consumer purchase decision making process generally follows the five-stage model. This process is influenced by internal and external factors. Suggestions are given to Baidu Inc.. Ideas for further studies are presented.

The term immersion continues to be applied inconsistently within and across different fields of research connected with the study of virtual reality and interactive media. Moreover, immersion is oftentimes used interchangeably with the terms presence and engagement. This article details a review of existing definitions of immersion originating within the study of video games, virtual environments, and literary works of fiction. Based on this review, a three-dimensional taxonomy of the various conceptualizations of immersion is proposed. That is, the existing definitions of immersion may be broadly divided into three categories, each representing a dimension of the taxonomy: immersion as a property of a system, a subjective response to narrative contents, or a subjective response to challenges within the virtual environment. Finally, four distinct theories of presence are introduced and, based on the established taxonomy, we discuss how the individual theories relate to existing definitions of immersion.

Global hospitality and tourism management technologies
Digital games have become more and more popular in recent years. These games are part of everyday life for many people and offer a wide range of opportunities for user entertainment and experience. Despite their entertainment purpose, the increasing use of digital games has raised concern about the possible negative consequences for gamers, especially among children and adolescents. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the relationship between digital game playing behaviour and health determinants in children and youth aged 12 - 24 years. Four electronic databases were searched. 39 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. There is a wide base of evidence from different kinds of study designs which support the view that excessive digital game playing may cause harmful consequences for the health and health related behaviour of target users. These findings can be used to develop strategies that aim at reducing problematic game behavior and its negative consequences.

Documents research on the impact of computer games on the learning of adults. Computer games and learning are characterized from a series of different theoretical and empirical viewpoints. Both civilian sector and military applications are presented. While effectiveness of game environments to support learning can be documented in terms of intensity and longevity of engagement (participants voting with their time), as well as the commercial success of the games, there is much less solid empirical information about what instructional outcomes are systematically achieved by the playing of individual and multiplayer games. This book will address these issues.Designed for professionals in the gaming, simulation, assessment and evaluation, educational technology, and educational psychology communities, this book explores the state of the art in the use of computer game technology for teaching and measurement of learning in adults. Its unique focus is on the empirical impact, both qualitative and quantitative, of computer games on the learning of adults.

"The growth of interest in virtual worlds and other online spaces for children and young people raises important issues for literacy educators and researchers. This book is a timely and much-needed collection of current research in the area. It provides a synthesis of knowledge and understanding and will be a key resource for scholars, students and teachers, particularly those interested in digital literacies. The work presents a coherent vision of current knowledge, and some of the most engaging, empirical research being undertaken on virtual worlds and online spaces in and beyond educational institutions. It contains international studies from the UK, North America and Australasia. This is an important time for those researching virtual worlds, videogaming and Web 2.0 technologies, since there is growing professional interest in their significance in the education and development of children and young people. Whether these technologies are solely associated with informal learning or whether they should be incorporated into classroom contexts is hotly debated. This book provides a principled evaluation and appreciation of the learning, teaching and instruction that can occur in digital environments, showing children, young people and those who work with them as active agents with possibilities to navigate new paths"--
