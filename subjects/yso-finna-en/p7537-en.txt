A manual for laboratory animal management
It was one of those childhood friendships of convenience - two lads in the same village who go to the same school. But then Cassidy gets it into his head that they should set traps for rats in his garden, and things start to go very, very wrong / WorldCat.
Provides information in the very active field of research on the rodent brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. The structure, connections, and function are explained in exquisite detail, making this an essential book for any graduate student or scientist working on the rat or mouse nervous system.
