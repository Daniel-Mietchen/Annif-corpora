Abstract.
Dressed to fill : producing and filling PET bottles
Collectable miniature perfume bottles
"This is the first major comprehensive book on the history and evolution of antique glass bottles between 1500 and 1850. Illustrated with specially commissioned colour photography, it depicts 773 bottles and seals carefully chosen from private collections, with only three examples being from museums." "Whilst the collecting of antique drinking glasses is very popular throughout Europe, the collecting of utility bottles has until very recently been much neglected on the Continent in spite of the wide variety of artistic shapes and colours. This book has been written for all collectors, archaeologists, museums, libraries, historians, writers, researchers, institutions, bottlemakers, wine and beer enthusiasts, pharmacists and anyone interested in the collecting of antiques and the social history they reflect. It includes the most comprehensive world-wide bibliography on glass bottles ever produced, listing 1,150 titles, and an extensive glossary of bottlemaking terms."--BOOK JACKET.
