The aim of this thesis was to improve methods for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and terphenyl (PCT) analytics with the equipment that was available, examine leaching of PCBs and PCTs from sample material and also determine the amount of mentioned compounds in the sample material. PCBs and PCTs have been widely used in products such as cooling liquids, flame retardant and additives in paints, printing inks and surfactants before environmental problems they cause were discovered.     For PCB- and PCT-analytics there was available gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and a compatible non-polar column. Based on the literature, a mid-polar column would have been the best option, but it was not available. In analytics of PCBs and PCTs, the thing that makes analysis challenging is the similarity of different compounds, so called congeners. Their retention times and mass spectra are very close to each other. In addition, in samples there is usually either very high or very low concentration of PCBs and PCTs and that further complicates analytics. In this thesis, sample material was ground waste from a storage room of an elementary school located in Tampere. The total amount of PCBs and PCTs in this material and leaching of them into water was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.     Contrary to preliminary information, no PCT-compounds were found from the sample material, so in this study attention was paid to analytics of Aroclor 1260 PCB mixture, for it was found from the sample material. The temperature program of gas chromatograph and ions to be monitored with mass spectrometer were chosen to be optimal for that exact PCB mixture. From the sample material was found about 3 700 mg of PCB compounds per kilogram of ground waste. This amount exceeds the limit of hazardous waste and thus has to be treated as hazardous waste. However, leaching of PCBs into the water was minimal, as highest 0.01 % of the PCB amount the waste contained.    All in all, compared to old methods used, there was change in temperature program, ions to be monitored and way of preparing standard solutions. In the future PCB and PCT analytics could be further promoted by creating respective methods also for other PCB and PCT mixtures. In this way analytics of other PCB and PCT mixtures can also be done in a highly reliable manner.        Keywords: Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated terphenyls, GC-MS.
This book describes the full range of mass spectrometry techniques and applications. This versatile technique is in ubiquitous use in universities and industry laboratories because of its ability to identify and quantify materials quickly and, if necessary, in minute amounts, and solve analytical problems in a huge variety of fields. The authors adopt an instructional approach and make use of recent examples to illustrate important points. This second edition includes new methods and applications that have developed in the last ten years. Powerful methods combining mass spectrometry with newer separation techniques, the increased use of computers, and analysis of once difficult polar and large-mass compounds such as proteins using new ionization methods are all discussed. Requiring no previous knowledge of mass spectrometry, this is an ideal teaching text at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, and will also be of considerable interest to research workers.

"This volume explores the use of mass spectrometry for biomedical applications. Chapters focus on specific therapeutic areas such as oncology, infectious disease and psychiatry. Additional chapters focus on methodology as well as new technologies and instrumentation. This volume provides readers with a comprehensive and informative manual that will allow them to appreciate mass spectrometry and proteomic research but also to initiate and improve their own work. Thus the book acts as a technical guide but also a conceptual guide to the newest information in this exciting field. Mass spectrometry is the central tool used in proteomic research today and is rapidly becoming indispensable to the biomedical scientist. With the completion of the human genome project and the genomic revolution, the proteomic revolution has followed closely behind. Understanding the human proteome has become critical to basic and clinical biomedical research and holds the promise of providing comprehensive understanding of human physiological processes. In addition, proteomics and mass spectrometry are bringing unprecedented biomarker discovery and are helping to personalize medicine." -- (Back Cover)
