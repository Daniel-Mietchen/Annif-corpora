The book represents an attempt to further bridges between mainstream theory on representation, and gender and politics theory, while offering a significant amount of empirical evidence. It links political input and output by tackling the democratic process from three different angles: (1) the mechanisms to access the representative institutions, (2) how do the representatives perform once they are elected, and (3) how well the MP's opinions match the voters' opinions, or how well does the 'electoral connection' function in substantive terms.
