In Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning, Eugene Gendlin examines the edge of awareness, where language emerges from nonlanguage. In moving back and forth between what is already verbalized and what is as yet unarticulated, he shows how experiencing functions in the transitions between one formulation and the next. A whole array of more than logical "characteristics" enables us to examine as well as to employ this new kind of thinking, which is not merely conceptual because it begins from the intricacy of felt meaning and returns to it again and again.

Nursing concept analysis : applications to research and practice
"An additional assumption was that the processes for theory development were new to nursing and hence, nurses in graduate programs learned strategies for advancing knowledge from other disciplines. This assumption was debunked with the knowledge that nurses were always engaged in knowledge development, driven by their experiences in clinical practice. Because of these assumptions, most of the early writing about theory development was about outlining strategies that should be used, rather than strategies that have already been used in the discipline to develop theories. Theorists themselves did not uncover or adequately discuss ways by which they developed their theories, therefore the tendency was to describe processes that were based on theories developed in other disciplines, mainly the physical and social sciences. And an implicit assumption was made that there should be a single strategy for theory development, some claiming to begin the process from practice, and others believing it should be driven by research"--Provided by publisher.
Creating scientific concepts
The things we mean
"The process of constructing concepts underpins our capacity to encode information in an efficient and competent manner and also, ultimately, our ability to think in terms of abstract ideas such as justice, love and happiness. But what are the mechanisms which correspond to psychological categorization processes? This book unites many prominent approaches in modelling categorization. Each chapter focuses on a particular formal approach to categorization, presented by the proponent(s) or advocate(s) of that approach, and the authors consider the relation of this approach to other models and the ultimate objectives in their research programmes. The volume evaluates progress that has been made in the field and potential future developments. This is an essential companion to any scientist interested in the formal description of categorization and, more generally, in formal approaches to cognition. It will be the definitive guide to formal approaches in categorization research for years to come"--
Institutional footprints in the addiction image : a focus-group study with Finnish and French general practitioners and social workers
Abstract : Algorithmic, intuitive and formal aspects of mathematics in dynamic interplay : a study of students' use of their conceptions in calculus.
The study of conceptual change traces its heritage to the notions of paradigm (networks of shared beliefs, concepts, practices) and paradigm shift made famous by Thomas Kuhn in his book, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions". Kuhn's work was quickly linked to developmental psychology (how knowledge develops) and to science education (teaching big, new ideas). This book is the first comprehensive review of the conceptual change movement and of the impressive research it has spawned on how knowledge develops and can be taught in different content areas. Because of its interdisciplinary focus chapter authors were instructed to write in a manner comprehensible to researchers and students from different fields.The "International Handbook of Research on Conceptual Change" consists of twenty-seven chapters that clarify the nature of conceptual change research, describes its most important findings and demonstrates their importance for education. It is organized into six sections that include detailed discussions of key theoretical and methodological issues, the roots of conceptual change research in the philosophy and history of science, mechanisms of conceptual change, and learner characteristics. It also contains chapters that describe conceptual change research in the content areas such as physics, astronomy, biology, medicine and health, and history. In this book, a particular focus is given to students' difficulties in learning more advanced and counter-intuitive concepts.
Experiencing and the creation of meaning : a philosophical and psychological approach to the subjective
Conceptual change research investigates the processes through which learners substantially revise prior knowledge and acquire new concepts. Tracing its heritage to paradigms and paradigm shifts made famous by Thomas Kuhn, conceptual change research focuses on understanding and explaining learning of the most the most difficult and counter-intuitive concepts. Now in its second edition, the book provides a comprehensive review of the conceptual change movement and of the impressive research it has spawned on students' difficulties in learning. In thirty-one new and updated chapters, organized thematically and introduced by Stella Vosniadou, this volume brings together detailed discussions of key theoretical and methodological issues, the roots of conceptual change research, and mechanisms of conceptual change and learner characteristics. Combined with chapters that describe conceptual change research in the fields of physics, astronomy, biology, medicine and health, and history, this handbook presents writings on interdisciplinary topics written for researchers and students across fields.
