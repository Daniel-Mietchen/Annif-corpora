Introducing 'The French ribbon', a unique sourcebook celebrating France's deep-rooted tradition of ribbon-making from the time when ribbons were an essential and often functional fashion accessory used to express individuality and style in everyday life, from weddings to times of mourning. Following the closure of one of the oldest factories in the industrial town of Saint-Etienne, France, an incredible cache of old salesmen's sample books, cards, and packaging surfaced to be photographed for posterity. Over 600 of these documents are now included ; ribbons made from cotton, silk, satin, velvet, metallic threads, and innovative synthetic materials. 'The French ribbon' is a must-have book for every person interested in fashion, design, craft, and the history of textiles.
