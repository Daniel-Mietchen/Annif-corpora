"This book includes methods for the design and implementation of industrial guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems for ships, high-speed craft, semi-submersibles, submarines, underwater vehicles and ocean structures. To be able to design motion control systems it is evident that a good mathematical model of the craft and the environment (wind, waves, and ocean currents) are required for simulation and verification of the design. The mathematical models are derived in a vectorial setting using Lagrangian and Newtonian mechanics. Simulation models based on the two main theories - maneuvering and seakeeping - are presented, and the concept of fluid-memory effects are demystified. This text covers state-of-the-art methods for GNC, including nonlinear multivariable PID controllers, state estimators and control allocation methods. More advanced topics, such as optimal control theory, backstepping, feedback linearization and sliding-mode control, are included for the advanced reader. Case studies and applications are treated at the end of each chapter. The Marine Systems Simulator (MSS), which is an open source Matlab toolbox, is used for illustration"--

This indispensible guide to ship stability covers essential topics such as flotation and buoyancy, small angle, large angle and longitudinal stability, water density effects, bilging, ship resistance, and advanced hydrostatics. Each chapter has a comprehensive list of aims and objectives at the start of the topic, followed by a check-list at the end of the topic for students to ensure that they have developed all the relevant skills before moving onto the next topic area. The book features over 170 worked examples with fully explained solutions, enabling students to work through the examples to build up their knowledge and develop the necessary key skills. The worked examples, which range in difficulty from very simple one-step solutions to SQA standard exam questions and above, are predominantly based on a hypothetical ship. The reader is supplied with extracts from a typical data book for the ship which replicates those found on actual ships, enabling the reader to develop and practise real-life skills.
