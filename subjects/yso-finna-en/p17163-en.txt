"The all-encompassing Second Edition of Prevention Practice and Health Promotion: A Health Care Professional's Guide to Health, Fitness, and Wellness offers foundational knowledge to health care professionals implementing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention to healthy, at-risk, and disabled populations. Dr. Catherine Thompson along with her contributors, all with diverse backgrounds in physical therapy, rehabilitation, and health care, present the interdisciplinary health care perspective of health, fitness, and wellness concepts that are critical for providing preventive care to healthy, impaired, and at-risk populations using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health model as a guideline for assessment and management. Based upon the goals outlined in Healthy People 2020, Prevention Practice and Health Promotion, Second Edition also combines the vision of direct access for health care professionals with the goals of national health care to increase the quality of years of healthy life, as well as to eliminate health disparities between various populations. Recognizing the cost effectiveness of preventive care, health care professionals have an expanded role in health promotion and wellness, complementing evidence-based medical management of acute and chronic conditions. Some topics covered inside Prevention Practice and Health Promotion, Second Edition include an overview of screening across the lifespan; effective interventions to promote health, fitness, and wellness; and options for program development, including marketing and management strategies to address both individual and community needs"--
