Citizenship : personal lives and social policy
""My father was born into war," begins this remarkable saga in Alisse Waterston's intimate ethnography, a story that is also twentieth century social history. This is an anthropologist's vivid account of her father's journey across continents, countries, cultures, languages, generations--and wars. It is a daughter's moving portrait of a charming, funny, wounded and difficult man, his relationships with those he loved, and his most sacred of beliefs. And it is a scholar's reflection on the dramatic forces of history, the legacies of culture, the experience of a Jewish immigrant, and the enduring power of memory. This book is for Sociology and Anthropology courses in qualitative methods, ethnography, violence, migration, and ethnicity"--

Abstract: Front national: between race and culture.
"Migration is one of the key issues in contemporary European politics and society, placing high on the political agenda in local, national and transnational political contexts, and widely debated in the media. All European states must grapple with the challenges posed when people move across borders. However, little is known about the relationship between the construction and elaboration of political discourse and its impact on institutions and actors associated with immigration, as well as the lives and everyday realities of frequently vulnerable migrant populations. This book engages with politics and political discourse that relate to and qualify immigration in Europe. It brings together empirical analysis of immigration both topically and contextually, and interprets such empirical evidence with the use of policy and discursive analyses as methodological tools"--

New challenges for migration policy in Central and Eastern Europe
This title adds a new dimension to the citizenship literature by using citizenship as a lens through which to explore the relation between personal lives and social policy. Citizenship is both one of the most taken-for-granted and most contested ideas in British social policy. While some claim that it defines the parameters of rights and responsibilities in advanced liberal democracies, others consider it to be among the most exclusionary of discourses and practices. Spurred by the effects of globalization, the rise in the movement of people around the world, and the profound reconstruction of welfare forms and relations, the issue of citizenship has come to occupy a central place in both official and popular debates. Taking these debates as the starting-point, this book focuses on the following domains to consider some of the dimensions of the lived practices and experiences of citizenship: the 'high moment' of working-class citizenship that was embodied in the post-war welfare state; the conflicts and anxieties experienced by children and parents in the transition to secondary school; the struggle of refugees and asylum seekers to gain right of residence in the UK and the possibility of building a new life. The authors draw upon a range of theoretical perspectives, including feminist, psychoanalytic and Marxist, to explore what citizenship can tell us about the ways in which personal lives not only are shaped by social policy, but can become the site from which some of the exclusions embedded in social policy and welfare practice are contested.

A contribution to one of the most hotly contested issues in Europe, "The Migration Debate" provides a well balanced, critical analysis of UK migration policies, in a European context, from entry controls through to integration and citizenship. Exploring the pressures and constraints that have shaped a rapidly shifting policy terrain, this accessible overview offers a considered assessment of policy options to provide the foundation for a less polarised, better informed public debate. Unusual in its coverage of immigration for work, study, family and protection, and in its insistence that an understanding of integration processes must be considered alongside analysis of entry controls, "The Migration Debate" will be of equal value to policy makers as to a multi disciplinary academic readership.
