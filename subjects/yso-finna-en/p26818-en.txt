"A social psychological analysis of computer-supported social interaction Zachary Birchmeier, Beth Dietz-Uhler, and Garold Stasser The use of computer-supported social interaction (CSI) has become a primary feature of communication among individuals, due in part to its structural features (e.g., freedom of time and geographical constraints) and psychological features (e.g., anonymity). As a consequence, many social scientists have investigated the social processes in computer-supported interactions, including online impression formation, relationship development, and group dynamics. Because individuals communicate via the use of computers in many personal, educational, and professional settings, it is important to continue and encourage the study of social processes in such environments. These studies have identified a number of influences on the behaviors (i.e., conformity, economic choices, etc.), thoughts (i.e., attitude change, impression formation, etc.), and, to a lesser degree, physiological/emotional states of people involved in computer-supported interaction.

"On an everyday basis, we communicate with one another using various technological mediums, such as text messaging, social networking tools and electronic mail, in work, educational and personal settings. As a consequence of the increasing frequency of use and importance of computer-supported interaction, social scientists in particular have heeded the call to understand the social processes involved in such interactions. In this volume, the editors explore how aspects of a situation interact with characteristics of a person to help explain our technologically-supported social interactions. The person-by-situation interaction perspective recognizes the powerful role of the situation and social forces on behavior, thought and emotion, but also acknowledges the importance of person variables in explaining social interaction, including power and gender, social influence, truth and deception, ostracism and leadership. This important study is of great relevance to modern readers, who are more and more frequently using technology to communicate with one another"--

"Why are there so many nature metaphors - clouds, rivers, streams, viruses, and bugs - in the language of the internet? Why do we adorn our screens with exotic images of forests, waterfalls, animals and beaches? In Technobiophilia: Nature and Cyberspace, Sue Thomas interrogates the prevalence online of nature-derived metaphors and imagery and comes to a surprising conclusion. The root of this trend, she believes, lies in biophilia, defined by biologist E.O. Wilson as 'the innate attraction to life and lifelike processes'. In this wide-ranging transdisciplinary study she explores the strong thread of biophilia which runs through our online lives, a phenomenon she calls 'technobiophilia', or, the 'innate attraction to life and lifelike processes as they appear in technology'. The restorative qualities of biophilia can alleviate mental fatigue and enhance our capacity for directed attention, soothing our connected minds and easing our relationship with computers.Technobiophilia: Nature and Cyberspace offers new insights on what is commonly known as 'work-life balance'. It explores ways to make our peace with technology-induced anxiety and achieve a 'tech-nature balance' through practical experiments designed to enhance our digital lives indoors, outdoors, and online.The book draws on a long history of literature on nature and technology and breaks new ground as the first to link the two. Its accessible style will attract the general reader, whilst the clear definition of key terms and concepts throughout should appeal to undergraduates and postgraduates of new media and communication studies, internet studies, environmental psychology, and human-computer interaction. www.technobiophilia.com"--

How is desire presented on screen and through popular culture? How can we theorise desire without falling into pre-subscribed notions of lack and loss? Theorising Desire offers an innovative approach to understanding the concept of desire through its presentation in film, television and popular culture. It examines the concept as it is theorised in psychoanalytic, feminist and film studies and presented in a diverse range of films and television programmes such as Code 46, In the Mood for Love, Safe and Sex and the City. Anchoring its theorisation around concepts such as risk, hysteria, the gaze, shame and melancholia, this book considers what desire does rather than what it is, and argues that movement is central to the concept of desire and to its radical potential to transform those affected by it.
