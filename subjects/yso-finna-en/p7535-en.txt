The sociological study of economic activity has witnessed a significant resurgence. Recent texts have chronicled economic sociology's nineteenth-century origins while pointing to the importance of context and power in economic life, yet the field lacks a clear understanding of the role that concepts at different levels of abstraction play in its organization. "Economic Sociology" fills this critical gap by surveying the current state of the field while advancing a framework for further theoretical development. Alejandro Portes examines economic sociology's principal assumptions, key explanatory concepts, and selected research sites. He argues that economic activity is embedded in social and cultural relations, but also that power and the unintended consequences of rational purposive action must be factored in when seeking to explain or predict economic behavior. Drawing upon a wealth of examples, Portes identifies three strategic sites of research - the informal economy, ethnic enclaves, and transnational communities - and he eschews grand narratives in favor of mid-range theories that help us understand specific kinds of social action. The book shows how the meta-assumptions of economic sociology can be transformed, under certain conditions, into testable propositions, and puts forward a theoretical agenda aimed at moving the field out of its present impasse.

In 1997 the Russian economy seemed to have overcome inflation and to be poised for economic growth.But as it turned out there was little time to enjoy the fruits of financial stabilization, which was overturned by the 1998 crisis.Some reasons for inconsistencies in the Russian financial stabilization program are analysed here, as well as the conflict between the stability objective of monetary policy and the potentially inflationary budgetary policy that evolved in Russia in 1995-1997.Also discussed are certain trends in macroeconomic performance in 1996-1997 that raised the probability of a financial crisis. .

Inflation and capital markets
Contrary to most experience, Estonia (as well as Latvia and Lithuania) has been able to combine, for a number of years, fixed exchange rates, financial liberalisation (prior to proper supervision) and large current account deficits without inviting speculation using large capital flows as vehicles.The standard argument is that this must be due to exceptionally sound fundamentals and great policy credibility.Without challenging this argument either generally or for the case of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, this paper offers a supplementary perspective.These countries did not aim at developing a full-scale national economy with a full set of financial and other markets, as they had the possibility of joining an institutionally, culturally and geographically close set of North-Western European markets.Such a strategy goes further than having the goal of "rejoining Europe" as the external policy anchor.Having well-developed domestic markets can in some cases be substituted by accessing near-by markets, thus leaving little leeway to potentially unstable capital flows.This option, however, is not open to all, and it also has its downside. Key words: capital flows, exchange rate systems, institutional development, financial liberalisation, Baltic countries .

The countercyclical capital buffer requirement is one of the new macroprudential instruments that will come into use in Finland. It enables the strengthening of the banking sector's resilience to systemic risks resulting from excessive credit growth. In setting the requirement, strong emphasis should be placed on a small range of indicators to be selected, defined and published in advance. In contrast, reducing or releasing the buffer should primarily be based on judgment by the relevant authorities..

"As financial markets expand and continue to refashion the world in their own image, the wealth of capitalist societies no longer presents itself, as it did to Karl Marx in the nineteenth century, as a "monstrous collection of commodities." Instead, it appears as an equally monstrous collection of financial securities, and the critique of political economy must proceed accordingly. But what would it mean to write Capital in the twenty-first century? Are we really to believe that risk, rather than labor, is now regarded as the true fount of economic value? Can it truly be the case that the credit relation--at least in the global North--has replaced the wage relation as the key site of exploitation and political struggle? And finally, if precarity is indeed the name of today's proletarian condition, what possible future does it actually portend, what analysis does it require? Through a series of creative substitutions, in Portfolio Society Ivan Ascher extends Marx's critical project in bold and unexpected ways. Ascher not only explains some of the often mystifying processes of contemporary finance, he also invites us to consider what becomes of capitalism itself in those places where the relation of capital to its own future is now mediated by financial markets. In the end, we may find that much has changed and much has not; relations of domination endure, and mystifications abound, but the devil is in the details, and that is where Ascher directs our attention. At once a critique of modern finance and of the societies under its spell, Portfolio Society succeeds in revealing the potential limits of Capital, while reveling still in its limitless potential." --

This thesis aims at answering the question regarding the reasonability of real options valuation in the hotel industry by conducting a case study with the support of secondary and primary research.  By incorporating the value of individual capital investment opportunities into a project's gross  present value, real options valuation can be characterised as an extension of traditional valua-tion approaches such as the discounted cash flow methods, thereby reducing their uncertainty,  inflexibility, and incomprehensiveness.    Taking advantage of the analogy between financial and real options, institutionalised valuation methods such as the Black-Scholes formula (1973) or the binomial options pricing model by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) have been applied to evaluate different options of a real hotel investment project.     Although controversially discussed and so far practically unproven in the hotel industry due to a certain complexity, it is shown that it can be very valuable to incorporate real options into the valuation process.      Based on several simplifications and by recognising the need to investigate each individual option more in detail, this thesis reveals that the evaluation of real options can serve as an important decision base for hotel investors under the condition of a fairly certain future outlook and relatively stable environmental conditions.
The study looks at the effects of the introduction of the euro on the Estonian economy.A priori, introduction of the euro may affect the Estonian economy through several different channels.The study focuses mainly on Estonia¬ís foreign trade, banking system and capital flows.In short, it is not possible to discern any clear and definite effects of the euro at this point in time, although some emerging trends may be attributable to the introduction of the single currency and Estonia¬ís EU accession process.Estonia has become quite integrated with the EU, and this trend is expected to continue also in the future. Key words: Estonia, Economic and Monetary Union, foreign trade, capital flows .

Financing development in a world of private capital flows : the challenge for multilateral development banks in working with the private sector
Against the backdrop of the international financial and economic crisis, this paper seeks to identify financial vulnerabilities in Emerging Europe. Data are presented for 20 countries using a 'balance-sheet' framework to disaggregate financial weaknesses within each economy. First, financial flow imbalances and general macroeconomic weaknesses are identified, leading to a discussion of the financial stock imbalances that were caused by these persistent flow imbalances. The paper concludes with an assessment of which countries are most vulnerable to any potential 'sudden-stop' of financial flows to the region.   Key words: financial crisis, balance-sheets, emerging economies, Emerging Europe .

When the Governing Council of the ECB decided in March 2016 to increase monthly purchases under the expanded asset purchase programme (EAPP) from EUR 60 billion to EUR 80 billion, it also decided to add corporate sector bonds to the programme. Purchases under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) began at the beginning of June and are intended to run - as is the whole APP - until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary. The purchases are carried out by six national central banks, including the Bank of Finland, acting on behalf of the Eurosystem..
