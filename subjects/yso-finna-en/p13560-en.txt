"Bridging the gap between the marketer who must put text analytics to use and the increasingly rarefied community of data analysis experts, Practical Text Analytics is an accessible guide to the many remarkable advances in text analytics that specialists are discussing among themselves. Instead of being a resource for programmers, a book on theory or an introduction on how to use advanced statistical programs, this daily reference resource cuts through the profusion of jargon, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various methods and serving as a guide to what is credible in this fast-moving and often confusing field. Practical Text Analytics provides guidance on the application of text analytics for marketing professionals who must interpret the results and apply them in their campaigns. It presents the process of analysis in ways that people who use the data need to see them, helping marketers to clarify and organize confidently the confusing array of methods, frame the right questions and apply the results successfully to find meaning in any unstructured data and develop powerful new marketing strategies. About the series: The Marketing Science series makes difficult topics accessible to marketing students and practitioners by grounding them in business reality. Each book is written by an expert in the field and includes case studies and illustrations so marketers can gain confidence in applying the tools and techniques and commission external research"--

Benefits of social media marketing for small businesses
Nowadays, digital solutions and social online interaction are commonly used for educational purposes. One of the pioneers who offers modern and innovative solutions for e-learning is Finnish company HappyWise Ltd. based in Oulu. Due to low resources and lack of know-how HappyWise Ltd needs support to the planning of marketing activities and therefore the authors implemented marketing plan for which market research about their e-learning programme HappyWise Trainer was conducted. Hence, the main aspect is marketing plan which includes various analyses e.g. about macro environment and competitors. Marketing mix will be outlined through 4 P’s: product, place, price and promotion. Based on these, marketing communications plan is discussed and recommendations are presented. Unfortunately the market research was unsuccessful resulting from practical part which is discussed more specifically later in this thesis. However, the marketing plan was successfully completed with the support of theoretical framework. Forthcoming step to HappyWise is to concentrate on essential marketing activities and consider having position in personnel focusing only on this.
