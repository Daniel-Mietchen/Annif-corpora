Investigations done at an old sawmill site found high levels of PCDD/F (Dioxin) contamination. As the area has been allocated as a residential development, remediation of the site has been started, which involves the excavation of contaminated soil and transporting it to landfill sites. The purpose of this work is to clarify the concept of dioxin contamination in soil and review different remediation techniques available for dioxin contaminated soil. A-Insinöörit requested a study that would assist the company in making decisions that will provide their customers with the best possible options in this regard. The study was based on a number of different researches done in Finland and Internationally on dioxin contamination and the different remediation techniques currently in use or in development. While landfilling is the most common and economical remediation solution in currently in use, Mecanochemical treatment was identified as the treatment with the most potential for the future and it's development needs to be followed closely. Landfilling is still the best option for the company at this time, but the fact that the soil contamination is just relocated and still present in landfills, means that a permanent treatment will still be required to eliminate the dangers associated with dioxin toxicity in future.
