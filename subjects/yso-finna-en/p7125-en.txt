Small scale energy production has become increasingly popular. Each production unit increases the energy independence of individual households, while the aggregate production of many units together decreases the burden on centralized energy production systems. Several technologies for small-scale energy production have been developed.  The aim of this thesis work was to produce English language material about small wind power production technology and the installation process for a small wind power unit in Finland. The thesis work discusses wind, windiness in Finland, and wind power production in theory, and goes through the installation steps.  The wind conditions in Finland are defined as adequate for small-scale wind power production, especially in the coastal and archipelago areas, as well as on fells and hills.  Also inland sites near an open water body or fields are good windy locations. Small wind power production units are commonly used in boats, summerhouses and remote locations, as well as to produce extra energy for housing. The sizing is scaled according to the given application for the wind power production unit, and the energy produced can be used to charge batteries or to produce heat and power. In the case of heat and power production, the system is connected to the common power grid.  A profitable investment in small wind power production requires a combination of selecting an optimal location, having accurate data on long-term wind conditions, calculating the optimum size of the unit, and having a long-lasting reliable small wind power production unit. However, it is impossible to calculate accurate costs or profitability of small wind energy production due to the variability of wind conditions and the fluctuating price of electricity in the grid. The investment costs of small-scale wind power production are high, so the initial investment can only be recouped by operating the production unit over a long period of time. After the expensive initial investments, wind energy is free of charge and naturally renewable despite the maintenance and repair costs. Furthermore, small wind energy production is often considered as a matter of principle for promoters of green energy.  Keywords: Small Wind Power Production, Wind Power, Micro production.

This thesis studies the long-term relation between the solar wind driven energetic particle forcing into the atmosphere and the tropospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere winter. The work covers the period of more than one hundred years since the turn of the 20th century to present. The thesis makes a statistical analysis of satellite measurements of precipitating energetic electrons, sunspot number data and geomagnetic activity, and compares them with temperature and pressure measurements made at the Earth's surface.Recent results, both observational and from chemistry climate models, have indicated significant effects in the Earth's middle atmosphere due to the energetic electrons precipitating from the magnetosphere. These effects include the formation of reactive hydrogen and nitrogen oxides in the high latitude mesosphere and the depletion of ozone caused by them. Ozone is a radiatively active and important gas, which affects the thermal structure and dynamics of the middle atmosphere. Accordingly, the depletion of ozone can intensify the large scale stratospheric circulation pattern called the polar vortex. Winter weather conditions on the surface have been shown to be dependent on the polar vortex strength.This thesis shows that there is a significant relation between the average fluxes of medium energy (ten to hundred keVs) precipitating electrons and surface temperatures in parts of the Northern Hemisphere in winter time. Temperatures are positively correlated with electron fluxes in North Eurasia and negatively correlated in Greenland during the period 1980-2010 which is covered by direct satellite observations of precipitating particles. This difference is especially notable when major sudden stratospheric warmings and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which both are known to affect the polar vortex strength, are taken into account. When extended to the late 19th century, the analysis shows that a similar temperature pattern is predominated during the declining phase of the sunspot cycle. The high speed solar wind streams and energetic particle precipitation typically maximize also at the declining phase of the solar cycle. This specific temperature pattern is related to the variability of the northern annular mode (NAM), which is the most significant circulation pattern in the Northern Hemisphere winter. Before the space era, geomagnetic activity measured by ground observations can be used as a proxy for energetic particle precipitation. Earlier studies have found a significant positive correlation between geomagnetic activity and NAM since the 1960s. We find that, when the QBO measured at 30 hPa height is in the easterly phase, a positive correlation is extended to the beginning of 1900s. We also show that high geomagnetic activity causes a stronger effect in the Northern Hemisphere winter than high sunspot activity, especially in the Atlantic and Eurasia.A comprehensive knowledge of the Earth's climate system and all its drivers is crucial for the future projection of climate. Solar variability effects have been estimated to produce only a small factor to the global climate change. However, there is increasing evidence, including the results presented in this thesis, that the different forms of solar variability can have a substantial effect to regional and seasonal climate variability. With this new evidence, the solar wind related particle effects in the atmosphere are now gaining increasing attention. These effects will soon be included in the next coupled model inter comparison project (CMIP6) as an additional solar related climate effect. This emphasizes the relevance of this thesis.
