Brick and stone have been used in architecture for a centuries and are favoured by architects for their unique properties. In recent years, with the development of new technologies, the variety of brick and stone materials has been greatly extended. This superbly illustrated book discusses masonry in two sections addressing brick and stone respectively, and goes further into detailed classification. The projects are elaborately selected and analysed, each presented with photos, drawings and narratives. Also included is a summary of the current state and future of the application of brick and stone in architecture, providing readers with a new understanding of masonry in the 21st century.
