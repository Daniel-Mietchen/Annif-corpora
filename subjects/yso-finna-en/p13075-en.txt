The present volume is an extensive monograph on the analytic and geometric aspects of Markov diffusion operators. It focuses on the geometric curvature properties of the underlying structure in order to study convergence to equilibrium, spectral bounds, functional inequalities such as Poincare, Sobolev or logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, and various bounds on solutions of evolution equations. At the same time, it covers a large class of evolution and partial differential equations. The book is intended to serve as an introduction to the subject and to be accessible for beginning and advanced scientists and non-specialists. Simultaneously, it covers a wide range of results and techniques from the early developments in the mid-eighties to the latest achievements. As such, students and researchers interested in the modern aspects of Markov diffusion operators and semigroups and their connections to analytic functional inequalities, probabilistic convergence to equilibrium and geometric curvature will find it especially useful.

Reveals How HMMs Can Be Used as General-Purpose Time Series Models Implements all methods in R Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R applies hidden Markov models (HMMs) to a wide range of time series types, from continuous-valued, circular, and multivariate series to binary data, bounded and unbounded counts, and categorical observations. It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out computations for parameter estimation, model selection and checking, decoding, and forecasting. Illustrates the methodology in action After presenting the simple Poisson HMM, the book covers estimation, forecasting, decoding, prediction, model selection, and Bayesian inference. Through examples and applications, the authors describe how to extend and generalize the basic model so it can be applied in a rich variety of situations. They also provide R code for some of the examples, enabling the use of the codes in similar applications. Effectively interpret data using HMMs This book illustrates the wonderful flexibility of HMMs as general-purpose models for time series data. It provides a broad understanding of the models and their uses.

"Markov processes are among the most important stochastic processes for both theory and applications. This book develops the general theory of these processes and applies this theory to various special examples. The initial chapter is devoted to the most important classical example--one-dimensional Brownian motion. This, together with a chapter on continuous time Markov chains, provides the motivation for the general setup based on semigroups and generators. Chapters on stochastic calculus and probabilistic potential theory give an introduction to some of the key areas of application of Brownian motion and its relatives. A chapter on interacting particle systems treats a more recently developed class of Markov processes that have as their origin problems in physics and biology."--Publisher's description.

This book is an introduction to the modern approach to the theory of Markov chains. The main goal of this approach is to determine the rate of convergence of a Markov chain to the stationary distribution as a function of the size and geometry of the state space. The authors develop the key tools for estimating convergence times, including coupling, strong stationary times, and spectral methods. Whenever possible, probabilistic methods are emphasized. The book includes many examples and provides brief introductions to some central models of statistical mechanics. Also provided are accounts of random walks on networks, including hitting and cover times, and analyses of several methods of shuffling cards.

"Preface. Latent Markov models represent an important class of latent variable models for the analysis of longitudinal data, when the response variables measure common characteristics of interest which are not directly observable. Typically, the response variables are categorical, even if nothing precludes that they have a different nature. These models find application in many relevant fields, such as educational and health sciences, when the latent characteristics correspond, for instance, to a certain type of ability or to the quality-of-life. Important applications are also in the study of certain human behaviors which are relevant for social and economic research. The main feature that distinguishes latent Markov models from other models for longitudinal data is that the individual characteristics of interest, and their evolution in time, are represented by a latent process which follows a Markov chain. This implies that we are in the field of discrete latent variable models, where the latent variables may assume a finite number of values. Latent Markov models are then strongly related to the latent class model, which is an important tool for classifying a sample of subjects on the basis of a series of categorical response variables. The latter model is based on a discrete latent variable, the different values of which correspond to different subpopulations (named latent classes) having a common distribution about the response variables. The latent Markov model may be seen as an extension of the latent class model in which subjects are allowed to move between the latent classes during the period of observation"--
