This practical text helps student teachers develop their confidence, understandings and skills so that they can effectively and authentically teach arts in primary and middle school classrooms. Delivering Authentic Arts Education outlines the true nature of arts education and its importance in the curriculum, emphasising the arts as forms of creative activity, meaning-making and expression in a cultural context. Written in the context of the Australian Curriculum: The Arts, this new edition makes it easy for students to connect to curriculum documents. Chapters discuss how to recognise and build on your existing artistic abilities and pedagogical skills, how to encourage children's creativity, and the general principles of planning and assessment. It then examines the five arts areas: dance, drama, media arts, music and visual arts. The final part of the text contains sample learning activities and resources that demonstrate how to plan an effective lesson within a unit of inquiry. Practical tips, classroom 'snapshots', starter ideas and suggestions for programs show you the links between theory and practice so you can develop arts education experiences that are purposeful, stimulating and engaging for everyone.

Why we make art : and why it is taught
This yearbook is the third in an annual series of publications by the International Network for Research in Arts Education (INRAE). It provides an inclusive study of contemporary research trends in arts education. The book is based on the idea of constructing knowledge in arts education with the wisdom of the many. 104 scholars from across the world convey the zeitgeist of key issues in research in arts education through 91 entries. Various disciplines of arts education (music, art, visual arts and digital media, drama and theatre), as well as sections on interdisciplinary themes (culture, communities, teaching and learning, assessment, policy, morals, ethics and aesthetics) and methodological issues (a research section), are incorporated in a compendium for every researcher, student, teacher or artist who wants to be engaged in the recent exchange of scholarly ideas on what is considered significant by the many. The key issues represented in the book reflect images and observations that a large body of researchers consider to be essential at this point of time.

A/r/tography : rendering self through arts-based living inquiry
"This compendium engages art critics, art educators, and art therapist in a conversation about artists with disabilities in non-traditional settings. For the sake of clarity, this population is subsumed under the term "Outsider."The idiosyncratic, often passionate and self-taught nature of "Outsider" art has captured the interest of the members of these fields, posing provocative questions about the social order and its inherent exclusion. What the authors hope to arrive at is not further division, but rather a continuum suitable for the human condition"--

Winter art as an experience
This edited book gathers seven established art educators-educator artists who address art education from the philosophical position of Deleuze and Guattari. This book raises questions as to where the future of art and its education might be heading if the focus on art was to be repositioned along Deleuze and Guattaris philosophy of immanence. The chapters are speculative as they query what is thinking in the art process. There is an attempt to project other forms of what art can do, and the curriculum that can emerge when a student-centered problematic is explored along such lines.

The "Handbook of Research and Policy in Art Education" marks a milestone in the field of art education. Sponsored by the National Art Education Association and assembled by an internationally known group of art educators, this 36-chapter handbook provides an overview of the remarkable progress that has characterized this field in recent decades. Organized into six sections, it profiles and integrates the following elements of this rapidly emerging field: history, policy, learning, curriculum and instruction, assessment, and competing perspectives. Because the scholarly foundations of art education are relatively new and loosely coupled, this handbook provides researchers, students, and policymakers (both inside and outside the field) an invaluable snapshot of its current boundaries and rapidly growing content. In a nutshell, it provides much needed definition and intellectual respectability to a field that as recently as 1960 was more firmly rooted in the world of arts and crafts than in scholarly research.

Our art : the reasoning for the acquisition and placing of the public sculptures of the Jyväskylä City Art Collection in 1977-2007
Doing art together : the remarkable parent-child workshop of the Metropolitan Museum of Art
"The subjects of this book belong to a population that is marginalized and isolated. They are children and adults with disabilities--artists who make art in special classrooms, prisons, rural back roads, backwaters, and institutions. By focusing on this population, editor and key author Alice Wexler provides a common thread that unites traditionally separate fields of art criticism, art education, and art therapy. With firsthand experience in the field, each contributor to this volume offers critical research which challenges the non-transferable divide between us and them, encouraging art teachers, therapists, critics, and general readers alike to uncover their biases regarding the nature of art and education.

Arts and skills - source of well-being : Third International Journal of Intercultural Arts Education
"In The Muses Go to School, autobiographical pieces by well-known artists and performers are paired with illuminating essays by distinguished educators to produce a powerful case for putting the arts at the center of primary and secondary school curricula. Spanning a range of genres from acting and music to literary and visual arts, these smart and entertaining voices make surprising connections between the arts and the development of intellect, imagination, spirit, emotional intelligence, self-esteem, and self-discipline in young people."--Jacket.
