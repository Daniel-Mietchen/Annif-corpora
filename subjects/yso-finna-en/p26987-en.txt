Narrative unreliability in the twentieth-century first-person novel
This volume deals with the occurrence and development of unreliable first-person narration in twentieth century Western literature. The different articles approach this topic both from the angle of literary theory and through a close reading of literary texts from a variety of national literatures, including French, Italian, German, British, Dutch, Danish and Polish. In this way, the collection highlights the different uses to which unreliability has been put in different contexts, poetical traditions and literary movements.
