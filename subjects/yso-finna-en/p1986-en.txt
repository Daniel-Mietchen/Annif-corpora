This thesis was commissioned by the purchasing department of Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy, Turku to clarify the present state of electronic invoicing and to find suggestions for development. Some of the classified material was revised for publication. The focus was on numerical statistics of invoicing information to execute a development project's pre-research stage. Tampere site was used for benchmarking. The literary researches about electronic invoicing and supplier relationship management supported the practical examinations done for the client company. The practical research examined the invoicing figures in both sites and compared each other. A supplier questionnaire about electronic invoicing was made to explain the actual experiences of the suppliers about the challenges and benefits from e-invoicing actions with Sandvik. Later the practical research exploited the Pareto-analysis for categorizing the supplier base. The work included a creation of a process flow chart to understand the actual process flow at the moment and instructions about e-invoicing implementation for suppliers for future needs. There were also suggestions for future to eliminate the high level of errors in e-invoices because a development project is not efficient for a process that is primarily working only partially. The actual results were gained from the calculations about possible savings. It was discovered that even a small amount of certain suppliers would create a significant amount of monetary savings when integrated into the electronic invoicing system. Finally, suggestions for future researches were made. They aim to continue this particular project in Sandvik or exploit this thesis work for some other company in the same development intentions. Another possibility would be to review this work's accuracy and reliability.

PlanMill Cloud is an online, subscription-based B2B product which supports service-based companies' business processes such as project management, employee time reporting and customer billing. PlanMill recognized a need for more efficient generic automation within its infrastructure. With increasing demands, especially in northern Europe for businesses to use electronic invoicing there was urgency for an automated setup and configuration of PlanMill's online services with a reliable electronic invoicing operator.      As a part of the 14.1 Version release on 22.9.2011 PlanMill's goal was to completely automate the registration, settings, verification and enabling of electronic invoice sending (which includes printing and other services offered by the operators). The chosen operator was 'Maventa' – a locally based and emerging player in the e-Invoice market. The integration would take advantage of Maventa's comprehensive open API web service (Bravo version).      This report describes the architecture and explains the methods to be used. It then follows the requirements gathering, creation of user stories and corresponding Behaviour Driven Development models (BDD's), selection and requirements testing of the API methods and Maventa's class libraries with JSP tools, data mapping between to the two systems, and finally the refinement of the development BDD's into useful cross-browser test cases. Due to some resource restrictions and the version release deadline the project made some compromises for a less functional first-release of the feature.     An appropriate new UI would need to be designed to implement the BDD's within PlanMill's Java-based factory model architecture. The Java implementation was to be primarily undertaken by a senior developer utilizing the results of the JSP tests and in accordance to the BDD's. Any UI layer applied business rules would be handled by JavaScript and be the responsibility of the author.
