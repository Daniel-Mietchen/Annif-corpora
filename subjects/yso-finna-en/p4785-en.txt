This book unveils a corner of human history which has hitherto been unexplored and is therefore unknown. It tells the story of why and how Francis Maginn, a deaf Irishman from Cork, inspired the formation of the oldest Association of Deaf Peole in the United Kingdom. The origin and development of the British Deaf Association can be understood only against the background of the fate of Deaf People in recent centuries. Their advance is a tale which should be of great interest and full of surprises to deag and hearing readers alike.

Yhteenveto (Finnish summary)
Since its publication in 2004, "Civil Society" has become a standard work of reference for all those who seek to understand the role of voluntary citizen action in the contemporary world. In this thoroughly-revised edition, Michael Edwards updates the arguments and evidence presented in the original and adds major new material on issues such as civil society in Africa and the Middle East, global civil society, information technology and new forms of citizen organizing. He explains how in the future the pressures of state encroachment, resurgent individualism, and old and familiar forces of nationalism and fundamentalism in new clothes will test and re-shape the practice of citizen action in both positive and negative ways. "Civil Society" will help readers of all persuasions to navigate these choppy waters with greater understanding, insight and success. Colleges and universities, foundations and NGOs, public policy-makers, journalists and commissions of inquiry - all have used Edwards's book to understand and strengthen the vital role that civil society can play in deepening democracy, re-building community, and addressing poverty, inequality and injustice. This new edition will be required reading for anyone who is interested

Abstract: This thesis was implemented as development project, which purpose was to create an induction guidebook to Kuiville Pyrkivien Tuki ry primarily for induction of trainees. By the induction target group are meant healthcare and social services field students who conduct their internships often at Kuiville Pyrkivien Tuki ry. Kuiville Pyrkivien Tuki ry is in Jyväskylä area operating association whose aim of action is to help towards sobriety those substance abusers who have already become sober and those who are still striving towards sobriety by offering them apartments and light support. The purpose of induction guidebook is to improve existing induction process of trainees and make it more consistent by offering them a proper induction guidebook which would act as their support through the whole induction. Induction guidebook works as information source and as a tool for trainees' self-evaluation so that they can assess their own progress during induction period. The purpose of project was also to collect all the existing material and data concerning Kuiville Pyrkivien Tuki ry's induction from various sources into a single induction guidebook and to document the association's induction practices and methods.  In the induction guidebook are included an induction program and an induction checklist in order to support induction process and a questionnaire for inducted trainee to be filled after the induction period from his/her point of view so that the association could develop their induction process even further based on trainees' feedback. Induction guidebook included also all kind of other information of induction, association's operation model (association activity), job description and substance abusers as residents of the association's housing units.  The theoretical part of this project thesis consists of employee induction, job guidance and association activity theory parts. The empirical is the product of the project itself, the induction guidebook. The induction guidebook was provided to Kuiville Pyrkivien Tuki ry in a virtual form, so that it would be easily open for editing and updating in the future depending on their needs.

Other Kinds of Dreams' provides an invaluable insight into the political activity of black and Asian women in the UK both inside and outside the black and Asian communities. The book breaks new ground by: destroying the misconception that black and Asian women lack political involvement" integrating gender into the study of black and Asian political participation in Britain exploring the potential for alliances between black women and the new progressive 'black man's movement' examining black women activists' perception and experiences of white feminism. 'Other Kinds of Dreams also questions the homogeneity of the term 'black' and asks whether increasing social stratification within black communities undermines this unity.
Member organisations of IFHOH-Europe and the situation of hard of hearing people
Following popular demand, the National Union for the Deaf's seminal 1992 publication has been reprinted by the British Deaf History Society (BDHS). This 310 page book contains all the 30 papers that were in the original publication, plus two more papers that were not previously included.
"Eleven powerful pieces first published in The New Yorker recall the path terror in the Middle East has taken from a more peaceful time in 1990s Israel to the recent beheadings of reporters by ISIS. With the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Looming Tower, Lawrence Wright became generally acknowledged as one of our major journalists writing on terrorism in the Middle East. This collection draws on several articles he wrote while researching that book as well as many that he's written since, following where and how al-Qaeda and its core cult-like beliefs have morphed and spread. They include: a picture of Saudi Arabia under the control of the religious police; the Syrian film industry, then compliant at the edges but already exuding a feeling of the barely masked fury that erupted into civil war; Israel and Hamas waging war over Gaza. Others continue to look into al-Qaeda as it forms a master plan for its future, experiences a rebellion from within the organization, and spins off a growing web of terror in the world. The American response is covered in profiles of two FBI agents and a head of the CIA. It ends with the recent devastating capture and beheadings by ISIS of four American journalists and how our government handled the situation"--
