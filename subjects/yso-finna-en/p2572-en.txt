John Scattergood's 'John Skelton: The Complete English Poems', originally published in 1983, established itself as the leading academic edition with comprehensive notes. But it has long been out of print. In this revised edition the text is little altered, but the Introduction has been extensively updated to take account of recent Skelton scholarship and the section on Further Reading has been expanded to include the more important recent essays and books on the poet. The Notes have been thoroughly revised to bring them up to date and the Glossary has been expanded somewhat. A feature of this revised edition is that a more comprehensive account has been given of the Latin paratexts of some of the poems, which have assumed an increased importance in some recent Skelton scholarship. John Burrow, reviewing the original edition, wrote that it 'deserves to be accepted as the standard late-twentieth-century Skelton' (Times Literary Supplement, 1983). This revised and updated edition intends to make the book useful and authoritive for twenty-first century readers also. -- Publisher's description.

Introduction to the history of English
The doctrinal of sapience
This is the eye-opening story of the birth of one of the most celebrated literary creations of the English language. The middle-aged Chaucer did not enjoy the literary celebrity he has today--far from it. He was living quietly in London with a modest bureaucratic post, writing poetry for a small audience of intimate friends. For more than a decade, Chaucer had stayed precariously afloat in London's fierce factional politics. Aided by a strategic marriage and ties to the court of Richard II, he had enjoyed favor from two envied and despised men: the overbearing John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and the unscrupulous wool profiteer and London Mayor, Nicholas Brembre. Suddenly, swept up by events beyond his own control, he lost it all. During the autumn of 1386 he was expelled from his London dwelling, humiliated in Parliament, pressured out of his job, and forced into exile in Kent. Unbroken by these worldly reversals, Chaucer pursued a new life in art. Cut off from his London audience, he invented a portable one--a tale-swapping pilgrim band. He converted his previously private literary career into a public one, in the grandest of terms. At the loneliest time of his life, Chaucer made the revolutionary decision to keep writing, to change the nature of what he was writing, and to write for a national audience, for posterity, and for fame.--From publisher description.

The dicts and sayings of the philosophers
London, British Library, MS Additional 10304 contains the unique copy of one of the only two known English translations of Boccaccio's 'De Mulieribus Claris' prior to modern times (the other being that by Henry Parker, Lord Morley (EETS OS 214 (l943)). The present text consists of twentyone of Boccaccio's 106 lives of famous women, translated into seven-line stanzas. It exists in printed form only in the edition by Gustav Schleich (1924), not now readily accessible, and in selections edited by Julius Zupitza (1892). It is of interest and significance in several respects: as an instance of the cultivation of Italian humanist writing in fifteenth-century England, and in particular of the reception of Boccaccio; as an example of verse in the Chaucerian tradition on the subject of women; and as an example of selective adaptation in translation from Latin to the vernacular. The Introduction to this edition includes consideration of language and versification, and an analysis of the Middle English translator's strategies of selection from the source. The text is followed by a commentary including exposition of difficult passages, notes on significant modification of the source, and points of lexicographical interest, a select glossary, and an index of proper names.

An anonymous short English metrical chronicle
John Page's The Siege of Rouen is an eyewitness narrative account of Henry V's siege of Normandy's capital in 1418-19. The text is unique in English verse of the fifteenth century in providing a first-hand narrative of a significant event in contemporary warfare. The poet was (if we take him at his word) present at the siege, and his narration of the event is a complex mixture of patriotism and compassion, verse chronicle and historical romance. Page's poem is a rich and sophisticated piece of work, which until recently has received little critical interest....This volume constitutes the first critical edition since Herbert Huscher's 'John Page's Siege of Rouen' published in 1927. It contains an introduction with descriptions of the fourteen manuscripts in which the text is known to survive complete or in fragments, discussions of historical context, authorship, language, metre and verse form, genre, literary background, and reception. The edition includes a full collation of the extant manuscripts in the textual notes and variants, a commentary, glossary, and index of personal and place names (back cover).

A middle-English dictionary containing words used by English writers from the twelfth to the fifteenth century
Romance and the Gentry in Late Medieval England offers a new history of Middle English romance, the most popular genre of secular literature in the English Middle Ages. Michael Johnston argues that many of the romances composed in England from 1350-1500 arose in response to the specific socio-economic concerns of the gentry, the class of English landowners who lacked titles of nobility and hence occupied the lower rungs of the aristocracy The end of the fourteenth century in England witnessed power devolving to the gentry, who became one of the dominant political and economic forces in provincial society As Johnston demons traces, this social change also affected England's literary culture, particularly the composition and readership of romance. Romance and the Gentry in Late Medieval England identifies a series of new topoi in Middle English that responded to the gentry's economic interests. But beyond social history and literary criticism, it also speaks to manuscript studies, showing that most of the codices of the "gentry romances" were produced by those in the immediate employ of the gentry. By bringing together literary criticism and manuscript studies, this hook speaks to two scholarly communities often insulated from one another; it invites manuscript scholars to pay closer attention to the cultural resonances of the texts within medieval codices; simultaneously, it encourages literary scholars to be more attentive to the cultural resonances of surviving medieval codices.
