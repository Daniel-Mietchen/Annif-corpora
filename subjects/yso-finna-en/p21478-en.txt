The purpose of this work was to help seeing the market situation of current marine SCR markets and gather valuable information from present marine SCR end-customers. Also the basics of both SCR technology and the marine legislation regarding harmful NOx emissions were studied in general level to better understand the current situation of rapidly changing and growing markets and industry. The information regarding the market situation was gathered from public company internet sites. The customers' demands were examined by sending questionnaires via e-mail to several marine end-customers. The Analysis of the results was based on a scoring system enclosed in the appendices. Based on this study the current SCR markets are having only few major operators which have managed to deliver remarkable amount of marine SCR systems. The others are probably in promoting or developing phase and still aiming to achieve better status within the business sector. Based on the questionnaires to the end-customers the reliability of the system was the most important feature. Second important was the purchasing and maintenance costs following small size of system and easy operation.

The impairment of lung function caused by environmental exposure to pollutants and toxicants is a rising health problem, particularly in highly industrialized parts of the world. The problem is urgently calling for the development of new methodologies to assess both the level of elemental exposure and the effects for quality of health and longevity. This volume provides state-of-the-art information about the recent advances in occupational and non-occupational pollutant-related disorders of the respiratory tract, and the assessment of a threat they pose for the health-span. Heavy traffic-related air pollution, unnoticeable but salient health detriment, is dealt with at length.

In response to the tightening emission legislation of marine and stationary engines, Wärtsilä has developed Wärtsilä NOx Reducer, in short, Wärtsilä NOR. Wärtsilä NOR is based on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology which has the purpose of nitrogen oxide emissions abatement from exhaust gas. The goal of this thesis was to plan a training area, a training cell, for Wärtsilä NOx Reducer in Wärtsilä Land & Sea Academy Turku Training Centre. The objective was to determine the efforts needed to establish it, the needed equipment and the training possibilities with the cell. In addition, planning of the cell layout and general operating instructions was required. This study was carried out as a project for Wärtsilä Training Development department. It included inspections at the Turku Training Centre, meetings and discussions with technical experts in Wärtsilä, and self-directed planning. The starting point was good since the premises for the training cell were suitable. The old SCR simulator was already on the site, and utilizing the associated equipment and facilities was considered a cost-efficient compromise. The simulator and its components were upgraded to match the current Wärtsilä NOR system. As a result, the thesis forms a proposal for SCR simulator with Wärtsilä NOR equipment, with a possibility to do several various training exercises, including commissioning and maintenance procedures. The layout, including the working areas, is planned as well. The outcome is a preliminary plan to provide support and background information when considering acquiring Wärtsilä NOR simulator equipment.
