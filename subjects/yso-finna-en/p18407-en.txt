The designer's guide to VHDL
The main idea for this Bachelor's thesis was to produce a manual for MARS material reservation system for Elomatic Marine Engineering. The main objective was to prepare a simple and extensive manual for beginning designers. This thesis work was based on methods and feedback during the designing of the Oasis class cruisers. The beginning of the thesis contains the basics and content of the MARS system. Selected examples and main functions of the MARS system will be presented as guidance. Moreover, different MARS screens that designers were using are explained step by step. The thesis contains also the integration of the Nupas-Cadmatic ship design software and the MARS system. It is also studied what kind of operations designers made during the Oasis project.  In this thesis it was discovered that the examples were practical and made the usage of the MARS system easier.
