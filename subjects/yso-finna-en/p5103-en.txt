"Learning Theory and Online Technology offers a powerful overview of the current state of e-learning, a foundation of its historical roots and growth, and a framework for distinguishing among the major approaches to e-learning. It effectively addresses pedagogy (how to design an effective online environment for learning), evaluation (how to know that students are learning), and history (how past research can guide successful online teaching and learning outcomes). An ideal textbook for Educational Technology Masters, PhD, and Certificate programs, readers will find Learning Theory and Online Technology provides a synthesis of the key advances in e-learning theory, the key frameworks of research, and clearly links theory and research to successful learning practice".

The aim of the thesis is to provide a varied base of information on feedback, concentrating on feedback in the educational setting. Main emphasis is on the importance of reciprocal feedback. The case study was conducted in order to enhance the feedback system currently at use at Haaga Polytechnic. Feedback is a tool that lets people know how effective they are in what they are trying to accomplish. It provides a way for individuals to learn how they affect the world and how the world affects them. Reciprocal feedback simply refers to feedback that goes both ways. The concept of feedback is divided into two sections: the first deals with teachers' feedback to students and the second one is about the feedback students give to teachers. In the first section such issues are discussed as feedback as a part of the learning process, importance of feedback from teachers and designing feedback as a part of a course. In the second section reasons for collecting feedback from students is discussed in addition to validity of students ratings, mechanisms and levels of collecting feedback and the analysis and use of students feedback. The case study was made on the basis of the theory. First a questionnaire was designed based on information from our research to be used in the case study. Next the survey was conducted among the Bachelor degree students and the results were analyzed, concentrating on the question regarding feedback received form teachers at Haaga Polytechnic. Lastly conclusions on the case study were drawn. The result of the case study showed that the level of feedback received from teachers at Haaga Institute is quite poor. It could be suggested that the feedback process should be ongoing through out the module or course. One way could be an informal oral feedback at different stages of the course in everyday classroom situations. Formal feedback could be provided in writing after specific tasks such as presentations or tests. The workload of the instructors would naturally get heavier with such tasks but as the amount of everyday informal feedback increases perhaps the need for such a rigid formal system would diminish. Grading is a way of giving feedback but since it always comes at the end of the course it is not really useful for the students learning process.

New technologies have radically transformed our relationship to information in general and to little bits of information in particular. The assessment of history learning, which for a century has valued those little bits as the centerpiece of its practice, now faces not only an unprecedented glut but a disconnect with what is valued in history education. More complex processes―historical thinking, historical consciousness or historical sense making―demand more complex assessments. At the same time, advances in scholarship on assessment open up new possibilities. For this volume, Kadriye Ercikan and Peter Seixas have assembled an international array of experts who have, collectively, moved the fields of history education and assessment forward. Their various approaches negotiate the sometimes-conflicting demands of theoretical sophistication, empirically demonstrated validity and practical efficiency. Key issues include articulating the cognitive goals of history education, the relationship between content and procedural knowledge, the impact of students' language literacy on history assessments, and methods of validation in both large scale and classroom assessments. New Directions in Assessing Historical Thinking is a critical, research-oriented resource that will advance the conceptualization, design and validation of the next generation of history assessments.

"High quality learning is extensive, well integrated, deep, and supports the use of knowledge in new situations that require adaptation of what has been learned previously. This book reviews current research on the nature of high quality learning and the factors that facilitate or inhibit it. The book addresses relationships between quality of learning and learners' dispositions, teaching methods, cognitive strategies, assessment and technologies that can support learning. The chapters provide theoretical analyses, reports of classroom research, and suggestions for practical application for both teachers and learners. The book will be of value to teachers at all levels of education and provides guidance for students about how to approach classroom tasks in order to develop high quality learning"--
