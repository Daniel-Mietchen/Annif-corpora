This captivating book explores the lives of the ordinary people of Pompeii and Herculaneum – the two cities on the Bay of Naples that were buried by the catastrophic volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The plaster-cast bodies of the victims are the most vivid shocking reminders of the horrific event that made Pompeii famous, but who were these men, women and children so cruelly frozen in time? The author and curator of the exhibition brings the inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum back to life from the ashes and ruins of their own homes. Amongst the artefacts are magnificent mosaics, a carbonized wooden cradle and a birth certificate of a little girl, each of which is accompanied by stunning new photography.

"This book explores the relationships between heritage and sustainability in terms of both theory and practice. It examines the relationships between people and communities in the places where they live, and thus exemplifies the diverse ways in which heritage is used to forge identities and support and create memory, individually and collectively. The book encourages a view of heritage as a people-centred process and focuses on the aspects of cultural sustainability that help to support human well-being through socially- and culturally-sensitive policy and practice"--

This volume examines the implications and consequences of the idea of 'intangible heritage' to current international academic and policy debates about the meaning and nature of cultural heritage and the management processes developed to protect it. It provides an accessible account of the different ways in which intangible cultural heritage has been defined and managed in both national and international contexts, and aims to facilitate international debate about the meaning, nature and value of not only intangible cultural heritage, but heritage more generally. "Intangible Heritage" fills a significant gap in the heritage literature available and represents a significant cross section of ideas and practices associated with intangible cultural heritage.The authors brought together for this volume represent some of the key academics and practitioners working in the area, and discuss research and practices from a range of countries, including: Zimbabwe, Morocco, South Africa, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, USA, Brazil and Indonesia, and bring together a range of areas of expertise which include anthropology, law, heritage studies, archaeology, museum studies, folklore, architecture, Indigenous studies and history.

"Situated at the intersection of scholarship and practice, Heritage Keywords addresses the rapidly expanding use of rhetoric within heritage studies, unlocking the potential of fast-standardizing terminology and concepts through projects of 'redescription.'
