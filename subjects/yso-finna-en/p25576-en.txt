A detailed analysis of Saami prehistory from 5000 BC to AD 1500 along 500 km of the Bothnian coast in northern Sweden. The Saami were highly specialised seal hunters, who also practiced animal husbandry, farming and metallurgy in ways analagous to the Norse. In the early fourteenth century they were assimilated by the Swedish state, Christianized and driven inland, where many became nomadic reindeer herders. Their land-uses, place-names, technologies and spiritual ideas have strongly impacted upon north Swedish society and left an indelible, if little appreciated, imprint on Nordic culture.
