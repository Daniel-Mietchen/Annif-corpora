Abstract: Marks made by a wolverine to establish its territory were recorded in 26 places along a track 7.5 km long in the Värriötunturi fell terrain, NE Finnish Lapland. One urination and 26 markings with secretion from anal glands had been made on coniferous bushes and trees, stones, a tussock and a dry stick.
