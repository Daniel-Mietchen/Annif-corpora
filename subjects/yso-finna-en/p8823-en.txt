""If I could take what I've learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine was worthwhile. I'm already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you, but also my future glory in having stopped you from trying an expensive juice cleanse or thinking that it was your fault when the person you are dating suddenly backs away, intimidated by the clarity of your personal mission here on earth. No, I am not a sexpert, a psychologist or a dietician. I am not a mother of three or the owner of a successful hosiery franchise. But I am a girl with a keen interest in having it all, and what follows are hopeful dispatches from the frontlines of that struggle.""--

"Distribution Revolution is a collection of interviews with leading film and TV professionals concerning the many ways that digital delivery systems are transforming the entertainment business. These interviews provide lively insider accounts from studio executives, distribution professionals, and creative talent of the tumultuous transformation of film and TV in the digital era. The first section features interviews with top executives at major Hollywood studios, providing a window into the big-picture concerns of media conglomerates with respect to changing business models, revenue streams, and audience behaviors. The second focuses on innovative enterprises that are providing path-breaking models for new modes of content creation, curation, and distribution-creatively meshing the strategies and practices of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. And the final section offers insights from creative talent whose professional practices, compensation, and everyday working conditions have been transformed over the past ten years. Taken together, these interviews demonstrate that virtually every aspect of the film and television businesses is being affected by the digital distribution revolution, a revolution that has likely just begun.

This thesis is in two parts, consisting of artistic work and written work.  The primary emphasis is on the artistic work.  The artistic part of this thesis was a Habakuk concert held at the Risto Ryti Hall in Huittinen on 13.11.2010, which marked the release of Habakuk's album Koti.  The concert was recorded and filmed for a DVD release (appendix 3). The written part of the thesis is a study which was carried out on behalf of Habakuk.  Habakuk is a Christian pop rock band that was formed in Satakunta in 1998.  The aim of the written work was to establish and define the roles of pre-production and the producers in the making of a record.  The making of earlier records had been stressful and time-consuming for Habakuk, and with the aid of this dissertation work the band wanted to ascertain what effect good pre-production and the choice of producer have on the recording process. The band also wanted to find out what kinds of solutions or choices can help improve time management, and how the time that is used can be optimised to maximum effect.  The recording process involves a number of stages and disciplines, but this work only focuses on those areas in which Habakuk felt there was room for improvement. These areas were the producer (the person responsible for the overall artistic direction of the record), pre-production (choosing and editing pieces for inclusion on the record before the actual recording begins) and mixing (fitting the audio tracks together). The study in this thesis was carried out via e-mail with producers in October 2011.  The survey sent consisted of five open questions and a covering letter (appendix 2). The results of the survey lead to the conclusion that next time Habakuk begin the process of making a record they should place more emphasis on pre-production, including making a demo.  The band should also strive for more effective co-operation with both the producer and the mixer.  These measures may result in a record more like that which the band is striving to achieve.
