Educational philosophy and theory : an introduction
The relationship between democracy and education is always one of the core questions when it comes to the existence, continuity, and development of a democratic society. In the spirit of the original sense of philosophy, this is, the loving of wisdom, Mikko Valtonen pursues in this book a perspective of a wise educator and asks through insightful philosophical analysis what could be the nature of the most wise and best education imaginable. The book consists of seven key dimensions of radical democratic education which include 1) democracy as a radical and progressive form of living, 2) liberating and therapeutic view on education, 3) melioristic worldview, 4) the ideal of self-critical reason, 5) hope as a fundamental attitude in education, 6) the ideal of peace and non-violence, and 7) synthesis of theory and practice. In the spirit of radical democracy theory, Valtonen defends the extension and radical deepening of democracy in all educational practices and understands democracy broadly as an active, communal, and value-based form of living deeply defining our whole human existence instead of being a mere quality of a political system.

Making sense of theory and practice in early childhood : the power of ideas
How do you tailor education to the learning needs of adults? Do they learn differently from children? How does their life experience inform their learning processes? These were the questions at the heart of Malcolm Knowles' pioneering theory of andragogy which transformed education theory in the 1970s. The resulting principles of a self-directed, experiential, problem-centred approach to learning have been hugely influential and are still the basis of the learning practices we use today. Understanding these principles is the cornerstone of increasing motivation and enabling adult learners to achieve. This update of a pioneering classic contains all Knowles' original chapters alongside a newer second part by Elwood Ed Holton and Richard A Swanson charting the advancements on these core principles. A third section includes selected readings from previous editions to illustrate the theory's evolution, as well as important articles from other key experts around the world for a comprehensive view. This new edition includes: * New chapter outlines, learning objectives and careful edits of Malcolm Knowles' work to simplify the original theory * Updates to the second part to reflect the very latest advancements in the field * Revisions throughout to make it more readable and relevant to your practices.

"John Dewey is considered not only as one of the founders of pragmatism, but also as an educational classic whose approaches to education and learning still exercise great influence on current discourses and practices internationally. In this book, we first provide an introduction to Dewey's educational theories that is founded on a broad and comprehensive reading of his philosophy as a whole. We discuss Dewey's path-breaking contributions by focusing on three important paradigm shifts - namely, the cultural, constructive and communicative turns in 20th century educational thinking. Secondly, we seek to recontexualize Dewey for a new generation who has come of age in a very different world than that in which Dewey lived and wrote. We provide examples of such recontextualization by connecting his philosophy with six recent and influential discourses (Bauman, Foucault, Bourdieu, Derrida, Levinas, Rorty). These serve as models for other recontexualizations that readers might wish to carry out for themselves"--
