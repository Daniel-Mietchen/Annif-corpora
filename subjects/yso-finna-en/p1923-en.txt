On 18 November 2002, the Russian cabinet approved a plan to introduce deposit insurance.The introduction of deposit insurance is an essential condition for the modernisation of Russias banking sector, and, in particular, for ending the near-monopoly of Sberbank, the State Savings Bank, in the retail segment.In this note, we compare the main features of the proposed system with its European and US equivalents.Although several important aspects of the Russian scheme have yet to be defined, our initial evaluation is positive.Concerns about the stability of the Russian banking system, however, remain .
In November 2015, the European Commission proposed that a new European Deposit Insurance Scheme be established. The new scheme was to be launched at the beginning of 2017 and the reform include an 8-year transitional period. During this period the responsibility for pay-outs was to gradually be transferred from national level to the European Deposit Insurance Scheme by 2024..

This PhD thesis discusses the practices of wealth depositing in the 1st-9th century AD eastern Baltic (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). Wealth deposits are one or more valued object/s that is/are hidden deliberately as an intended separate deposition in a selected place in a specific, distinguishable manner. Wealth depositing is regarded as an important cultural practice which relates to and derives from various past social phenomena and changes respectively in spatial and temporal terms. It is emphasised that wealth deposits should be analysed as a cohesive corpus of material, regardless of specific artefact types, functional groups, production material, environment of concealment, and most importantly without any predetermined interpretation categorisations.00The dissertation presents different patterned practices of concealing valuables in the 1st-9th century AD eastern Baltic through a detailed contextual analysis of their main material characteristics: artefacts, their assemblages and appearance, environment of concealment, chronology and location in the cultural landscape. The study demonstrates how depositional practices change in time and space, and analyses relations between specific depositional practices and developments on a wider social scale. A comparative analysis of wealth deposits and important social changes in contemporary society based on overall archaeological material is presented. The key regional and cross-regional practices of wealth depositing in the 1st-9th century AD eastern Baltic are identified. Additionally, further comparisons are drawn between depositional practices in the eastern Baltic and other parts of the Baltic Sea region, especially Scandinavia.
