Abstract.
Examines the ways British travelers, explorers, mariners, and artists viewed southern Africa in a period of evolving and expanding British interest in the area. Looks at the aesthetics of landscape, scientific expeditions, missionary activity, and the impact of hunting among other themes to illuminate the relationship between Europeans and their interpretations of the region.

"What insights can an anthropologist gain from the day-to-day use of parks? How does an economist view the supply and demand of an outdoor space? Why would an architect divide landscape into 'cultural' and 'natural' elements? Experts from around the world give their thoughts on how disciplines outside landscape architecture view the profession. Their insights link together theories from outside the area, giving constructive feedback on the lessons they gain from work in the environment and what they can contribute back to the subject. The book is an important addition to the literature on landscape architecture and provides a valuable companion to landscape theory modules for undergraduate and postgraduate students"--

Imagining landscapes : past, present and future
The landscape has played - and continues to play - an important role in the process of constructing a national identity in Finland. In this process, certain areas and views, whether real or imaginary, are designated as vital symbols of the national culture. The landscape is not merely an image, a map or a view of the existing motherland, however. It is also a part of the nation's history, which is marked in the landscape in the form of significant buildings and monuments to historical events, so that the past may be seen as forming an unbroken continuum with the present. Work is constantly going on to maintain and renew the national traditions of landscape description. This means that whatever its age and nostalgic associations, the landscape is an integral part of our present-day lives. The images, maps, and discourses associated with the landscape may have altered in the course of time, and even the physical areas or views may have been replaced with new ones, but the ideal of a Finnish landscape has persisted. The signs and significations attached to it thus remain a powerful part of our national culture.
