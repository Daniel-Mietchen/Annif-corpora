Revenue is the "top" line on the income statement and is the fundamental driver of business success. It is essential that managers and executives understand the complexities involved in recognizing revenue under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the US Revenue Recognition principles are , are primarily concerned with two things: (a) the timing aspect (the when issue) and (b) the amount to be recorded (the how much issue). This book will provide extensive guidance in assisting managers with the appropriate answers to the two questions above for their companies. This book is principally designed for managers and executives who have organizational responsibility for delivering results in the form of "profits" for their organizations. The book will be a comprehensive yet readable examination of the existing rules of revenue recognition for corporate entities. After reading the book, the manager or executive will have a thorough understanding of how accountants measure and record revenue. This "skill-set" will prove invaluable in understanding the impact that their business decisions will have on the financial statements with an emphasis on the income statement and the statement of cash flows. The book will also have an executive-level overview of the proposed "IASB and FASB Standard: Revenue from Contracts with Customers."

The goal of the thesis is to study and develop business processes in a financial services company. The commissioner of the work is the Monetra Oy in Oulu. In the first phase the current state of processes is examined based on interviews of the key people in the company. At the starting point, the main key processes are identified based on services each team in the company provides to customers. In the second phase the analysis is conducted and the improvement areas are identified, in both processes and management methods for process development. The theoretical foundation presents concepts and methodologies relevant to reasoning of the documentation work, process description techniques, consideration of particular characteristics of people centric processes and finally process improvement practices. In the results section the execution of the work is explained and the findings of the analysis are introduced. The result is a documentation of business processes assigned for the study, and an analysis report with a collection of recommendations for future development actions.

Accounting is frequently portrayed as a value-free mechanism for allocating resources and ensuring they are employed in the most efficient manner. Contrary to this popular opinion, the research presented in Accounting at War demonstrates that accounting for military forces is primarily a political practice. Throughout history, military force has been so pervasive that no community of any degree of complexity has succeeded in surviving without an army. Through to the present day, for all nation states, accounting for the military and its operations has primarily served broader political purposes. From the Crimean War to the War on Terror, accounting has been used to assert civilian control over the military, instill rational business practices on war, and create the visibilities and invisibilities necessary to legitimize the use of force. Accounting at War emphasizes the significant power that financial and accounting controls gave to political elites and the impact of these controls on military performance. Accounting at War examines the effects of these controls in wars such as the Crimean, South African and Vietnam Wars. Accounting at War also emphasizes how accounting has provided the means to rationalize and normalize violence, which has often contributed to the acceleration and expansion of war. Aimed at researchers and academics in the fields of accounting, accounting history, political management and sociology, Accounting at War represents a unique and critical perspective to this cutting-edge research field.
