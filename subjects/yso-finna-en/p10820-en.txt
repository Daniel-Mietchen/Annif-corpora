Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are “any pharmaceutical product that are used for individual health or for cosmetic reasons as well as agribusiness to enhance growth of livestock or to keep it healthy” (EPA, 2010). PPCPs are used in huge amount on a daily basis throughout the world. PPCPs include prescribed and over the counter pharmaceutical products. PPCPs are found in many drinking water sources, in treated or untreated sewage including rivers, streams, ground water, coastal marine environments, and many other drinking water sources due to their easily dissolving nature under normal temperature and pressure.  This thesis on the toxicity analysis of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products was made on eight selected toxicants, which are fundamentally used to identify the levels of toxicity and effect on the aquatic organisms as well as to the terrestrial environment. The test was done by Microtox® Model 500 Analyzer, which is used to monitor changes in the level of light emission from a marine luminescent bacterium when challenged with a toxic substance or sample containing PPCP or test toxicant. The toxicity analysis made to all the selected eight pharmaceutical and personal care products showed their levels of toxicity and their effect to the aquatic organisms. The aquatic toxicity of the compounds were analyzed and summarized according to the standard toxicity categories, by considering their EC50 values. The test results were categorized as Toxic, Very Toxic, and Harmful according to the standard Classification of acute toxicity to Globally Harmonized System of Classification.  From the analyzed antibiotics, Norfloxacin indicated a very toxic behavior to the aquatic environment nonetheless Clarithromycin indicated a less toxic behavior and falls into the less toxic category of standard toxicity categorization. In addition, the analysis made on the commonly found parabens indicated a toxic behavior to the aquatic environment without exception.   Furthermore, the evaluation of toxicity of pharmaceutical active compounds and personal care products is a powerful and useful tool for assessing environmental impact of many compounds; consequently it is recommended that a further progress in these assessments could help analyze more compounds in these categories, that are used for everyday consumption, and to be able to establish a start point for the regulation and standardization in the environment.

"In this timely book, respected international experts summarize the most important research to provide an overview of the field [antibiotics]. Opening chapters define 'antibiotic', explain why we need new compounds, outline the applications of antibiotics, both old and new, and describe the producing microbes. These are followed by chapters that cover antibiotic resistance, toxicity, overuse, new antimicrobial sources, new targets, novel technologies for antibiotic discover (e.g. silent gene clusters), lantibiotics, natural antivirals, new macrolide derivatives, and antibiotics in the pipeline.This book is essential reading for everyone working in antimicrobial research in academia, biotechnology companies, and the pharmaceutical industry and a recommended volume for all microbiology libraries." --
