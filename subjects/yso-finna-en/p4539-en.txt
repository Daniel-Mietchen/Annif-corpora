For charitable organizations seeking relationships with donors, trust is as critical a factor as reputation. Simply put, people are reluctant to give if they can't be sure of where their money is going. Building trust is fast becoming recognized as a key not only to attracting donors, but to keeping them as well. Managing the Publics Trust in Non-Profit Organizations analyzes the intricate psychological processes behind trust and philanthropy and applies this knowledge to best-practice guidelines for nonprofits. This monograph explores cognitive, affective, societal, and other contexts for trust, and how these influence giving in the short and long term. On the practical level, chapters offer new research-based methods of assessing and gauging donor trust, and a real-world framework for building trust with donors, communities, and the public at large. These organization-level ideas are also related to larger policy initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals. Among the book's core topics: The role of trust in donating money. Understanding and measuring donors' trust in a charity. Improving charity efficiency and accountability in building trust. Communicating effectively with donors. Dealing with violations of trust. The future of charities and nonprofit organizations, especially in the digital age. The current climate demands more of the nonprofit sector as a major player in poverty reduction around the globe. Managing the Publics Trust in Non-Profit Organizations brings innovative thinking on philanthropy to researchers and academics, professionals in charity and nonprofit management, and policymakers.

Understanding voluntary organizations
Nonprofit organizations, which collectively make up the emerging sector, have an increasingly influential role in the economies and societies of countries throughout the world. This book, the product of comprehensive international research into the sector, offers an international overview of its scope, structure, financing and role. The authors provide a comparative summary of the findings of individual empirical analyses into the nonprofit sectors in 12 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Japan, Brazil, Ghana, Egypt, Thailand and India. They explore the global scale of the sector, its sources of revenue, and differences between the countries analyzed. They assess how well-equipped nonprofit organizations are to respond to the shift towards voluntarism and away from government in many societies, and they identify the key issues such organizations need to address in the future, such as coming to terms with globalization.
