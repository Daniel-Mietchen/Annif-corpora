"Lean methodology has proven effective in reducing costs and waste, and improving quality and value. Unfortunately, many in health care interpret lean's emphasis on reducing variation and standardizing work as anti-innovation. The book describes how VMMC has systematically integrated the structures, methods and cultural practices from the creativity and innovation literature into its implementation of lean. The theme of the book will be to show not just conceptually, but through VMMC's actual experiences how lean and innovation can work hand-in-hand to both incrementally improve and radically transform value streams"--Provided by publisher.

Innovations in health care : a reality check
Health care organizations around the world are judged in terms of a health care triple bottom line: ensuring employee and patient safety, maximizing employee and patient satisfaction, and meeting financial goals. Given the increasing burden of chronic diseases, the increasing complexity of medical interventions, and the increasing costs of care, innovative leadership is required to achieve this triple bottom line. The 14th volume of the Advances in Health Care Management research series addresses the links between leadership and safety, satisfaction or financial performance in health care management by exploring questions such as the following: (1) How does leadership impact employee safety?(2) How does leadership affect patient safety?(3) How does leadership impact employee satisfaction?(4) How does leadership affect patient satisfaction?(5) How does leadership affect financial performance?(6) How do health care organizations deploy multi-level leadership to achieve safety goals? Satisfaction goals? Financial goals? Multiple goals?(7) How do health care organization leaders establish and maintain a safety culture? A patient-centered culture? A high performance culture? Combined cultures?
