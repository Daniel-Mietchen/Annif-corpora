Secondary neuropathology after experimental stroke : with special emphasis on calcium, amyloid and inflammation
On the morning of December 10, 1996, Taylor, a brain scientist, experienced a massive stroke. She observed her own mind completely deteriorate. Now she shares her unique perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery.
Neuromagnetic studies on somatosensory functions in healthy subjects and stroke patients
The purpose of this study was to gather existing information about experienced stroke patient carers' perspectives on the support and educational needs required during the rehabilitation phase of stroke patients. The aim of the study was to create an educational and easy-to-read booklet for stroke patient carers, which covers coping strategies they may apply in their everyday lives. In addition, the aim was to increase nurses' understanding of the difficulties stroke patient carers face during the rehabilitation phase.    This Functional Bachelor's thesis was produced as project work. The project was conducted in close co-operation with nurses from rehabilitation ward of Hatanpään Puisto Hospital. The experiences of stroke patient carers, as detailed in research studies, form the basis of the information provided in the booklet.     The booklet provides stroke patient carers with information, education, and support. It also highlights aspects that experienced stroke patient carers found important in patient care. This booklet is produced for the rehabilitation ward in Hatanpään Puisto Hospital. Nurses in the hospital environment can assess the effectiveness of this information. Such information may ease new stroke patient carers' lives, give deeper understanding of the changes that may exist, and facilitate a quicker adaptation to their new roles.        Key words: stroke patient carers, project, an educational booklet.

"Clinical evidence clearly demonstrates that physical therapeutic measures begun as soon as possible after a stroke, often within 24 to 48 hours, greatly increase everyday competence and quality of life. Physical Therapy for the Stroke Patient: Early Stage Rehabilitation covers all the issues that physical therapists must deal with in this critical period: assessment of patients' abilities; care during the acute phase; early mobilization; effects of medication; risk factors; ethical questions; and much more. It provides complete guidelines on how to examine and treat the patient, the dosage" of physical therapy required, and the key differences between early and late stage rehabilitation after stroke. Special Features Information-packed chapter on Optimizing Functional Motor Recovery after Stroke," written by J. Carr and R. Shepherd, pioneers in the field and the first to correlate motor learning and stroke recovery Case studies throughout the book offering direct, hands-on examples of evaluation and treatment methods Nearly 150 color photographs demonstrating step-by-step physical therapy techniques used in actual practice Hundreds of references to the literature that support the evidence-based approach presented in the book For all physical and occupational therapists who must answer the question, How much therapy will help my patient?", this book provides clear, well-informed answers. Not only will it increase your therapeutic skills and confidence, but it will also expand your knowledge of the medical issues and long-term outcomes for the post-stroke patients in your care"--Provided by publisher.

The purpose of the study was to explain the effects of risk factor targeted lifestyle counselling intervention on quality of lifestyle counselling and on adherence to lifestyle change in stroke patients. Content and characteristics of stroke patient counselling was described (I) with narrative literature review (n=33). Lifestyle habits of hospital-admitted stroke patients were described and explained (II) with cross-sectional design (n=150). Quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design explained (III) the effects of lifestyle counselling intervention on working-age stroke patients' adherence to lifestyle change (n=75/group). Cross-sectional, explorative between-groups prospective design explained (IV) associations between the quality of counselling and adherence to lifestyle change during the 12-month follow-up (n=98).The literature data was gathered from the databases and analysed with content analysis (I). The empirical data was collected with Lifestyle (II), Adherence to Lifestyle Change (III, IV) and Counselling Quality (IV) instruments. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, cross-tabulation of variables, logistic regression, and ANCOVA were used for data analysis.Counselling was described with seven themes: information about the disease and concerns regarding stroke, aims of counselling, counselling methods, interaction as a method for counselling, stroke nurse as a counsellor, emotional support and decision making in patient care (I). Patients were overweight or obese (75%) and 86.7% had high waist circumference levels. They generally had rather unhealthy eating habits, were physically inactive and quite highly stressed, and 33.5% drank to excess every month or every week, and 32.9% were current smokers (II). After intervention the experimental group lost their weight at 3 and 6 months, reduced cigarette consumption at 3 months, and increased smoking cessation at 6 months. The experimental group received more support from nurses, family and friends (III). Lifestyle counselling quality was estimated rather good, with the exception of patient-centred counselling, and significantly better by the experimental group. Interactiveness, resources, and advantages of counselling were related to adherence variables (IV). Intervention had effects on lifestyle counselling quality and on adherence to lifestyle change in the short term.
