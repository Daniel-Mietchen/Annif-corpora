Oulu UAS educates professionals for the needs of Northern Finland, whose competence corresponds to the needs and development of working life in the region. We react quickly to the changes occurring in working life and the requirements of new competence.    At the degree programme of Information Technology we aim to develop our teaching to include more real-life project work: our curricula include increasingly more company-related projects. This way we are able to provide our students with a more realistic view of the everyday work at companies, and also improve their employment opportunities.    The purpose of this publication is to spread the word about the projects and results achieved by the students and staff of the Information Technology department. In addition to student projects, our department is also involved in many domestic and international projects well worth mentioning. Yearly, our students complete hundreds of thesis and project work. This publication also presents good examples of our successful projects.

Cost analysis in rural water supply in Mbeya region, Tanzania
The aim of this study is to search further franchising relationship between the franchisor and  the franchisee and see what changes have occurred in franchisee's operations since hotel joined a chain. Research topics include subjects discussed on existing literature e.g. quality in hospitality  and satisfaction of the franchisee with the chosen franchisor, how does a franchisee experience  the franchise relationship, what are the pros and cons and are they coherent with the theory and finally how do franchisees see the future of franchising and marketing cooperation in Finnish  hotel industry.   This study uses case studies to clarify how franchisees representing different chains experience  the franchising relationship and benefits of cooperation in Finland. Data is gathered through thematic interviews and analysis is based on same themes.   Results showed that in these three cases the franchisees were very content with their marketing cooperation. Further there were no significant differences between representatives of marketing cooperation- or franchised chains.

The structure of socialist society
The aim of this thesis is to outline the special characteristics of small rural food-processing firms in Finland and find out the different ways they cooperate and network with each other. The emphasis is put on the value and significance of networking for the food-processing firms and how the networking could improve local food production.  The research is a qualitative research by the aid of expert interviews. It is carried out by interviewing both the entrepreneurs of rural food-processing firms and different retailers. The interviewees are chosen in order to tackle the same topic from different perspectives; to get the inner and outer picture of the situation.  Rural food-processing firms are becoming very business oriented and professional. The firms have always been cooperating with each other and cooperation is held very important for the continuity of the business. Benefits can be found in sharing costs and facilitating operations in different procedures, exchanging knowledge and giving support. Due to the lack of time and areal isolation the creation and maintenance of effective networks is anyway challenging. An effective network demands a strong leader, usually a retailer who is able to convince the producers of the positive effects of closer cooperation, time to build trust and create operations satisfying every party, and the matching of form of activity and the product.  The effort should be put on the education of producers and on the increase of the awareness of the benefits and the significance of networking by establishing open communication between all the involved parties in the local food chain. Since the demand for near produced food is growing and the operations of rural food-processing firms are becoming more and more business oriented, networking is supposed to be one of the key issues in building success.  This thesis is written and formatted following the guidelines of the IMC Krems University of Applied Sciences since the main establishment and hand over happened in this institution.
