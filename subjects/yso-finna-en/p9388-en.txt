Scope and content: "The Global Atlantic provides a concise, lively overview of the complex and diverse history of the greater Atlantic region from 1400 to 1900. During this period, the lands around the Atlantic basin--Europe, Africa, and the Americas--became deeply interconnected in networks of trade, cultural exchange, and geopolitics that reshaped these regions and the world beyond. In this accessible and engaging text, Christoph Strobel integrates the Atlantic into world history, showing that the Atlantic oceanic system was always interlinked with the rest of globe"--Provided by publisher.

Russia is, with the exception of the USA, the single most important outside country for the European Union.Still, it just account for a few percentage points of EU global trade, even less of EU outward investment.The Union, on the other hand, accounts for about one half of Russia's foreign trade.The relation therefore is, though important, asymmetric. Institutionally the Union and Russia have been building their relation since the 1990's, but development was much enhanced by the northern and eastern enlargements of the Union on the one hand, and by Russia's "European Choice" as declared by President Putin. Still, developing the relation has not been simple, and in many instances this is caused by the underlying asymmetries of the relation.This paper outlines both the institutional and underlying economic basis of the relation and argues that it will remain a complicated one in the future as well.  Key words: European Union; European Neighbourhood Policy; Russia/EU relations. .

Argues that Dutch illegal inter-imperial commerce with Spanish, English, and French colonies was far more important than historians have realized. According to author, this Caribbean contraband trade, revolving around the entrep ots in Cura cao and Saint Eustatius helped Dutch to survive 17th-century loss of most of their territorial empire in the Western Hemisphere"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.

Second, reform has brought about the deepening of interdependence between the Chinese economy and the world economy. Third, reform has transformed the management of China's domestic and external economic activities. Market-oriented reform means that China's economic relations with Japan are now based on the comparative advantage of both countries rather than the Chinese, or Japanese, government's state plan.

Trade relations between Finland and Nigeria and between Finland and Ghana
Iran is one of the richest countries in the Middle East, due to its people and natural resources. Lately Iran has been in the media spotlight and created lot of controversy through out the world concerning Iran's alleged possession of nuclear power and its usage. The United States has resisted Iran's actions in fear that the real attempt is to manufacture nuclear weapons and it has forced economical sanctions to Iran in hope of stopping its actions. This thesis is a qualitative case study on trade obstacles in Iran, and it is done in co-operation with PerkinElmer/Wallac Oy. The theory part examines issues that biotechnical companies need to consider and analyse before starting an exporting process to Iran. It clarifies the meaning of export and introduces requirements and readiness of a company or a product to be able to export. It deals mainly with exporting of a product to Iran's markets. In this part, the meaning of commercial and political obstacles in international trade is presented. Furthermore, the theoretical part deals with the market situation in Iran from the perspective of a biotechnical company. In this context, the present state of Iran's health care system is examined and the economical and political atmosphere is introduced as well. The empirical research discusses whether there is demand for PerkinElmer's products in Iran. The research presents possible advantages and disadvantages of working closely with Iran. The political and commercial obstacles that biotechnical companies might face while penetrating Iran's markets are examined. Furthermore, the research indicates what kind of process of entering Iran would be in general. The empirical research was conducted through interviewing representatives of PerkinElmer. The results from the study indicate that several sanctions and regulations have been imposed to Iran. A business transaction with Iran has been made almost impossible. Iran is one of the countries in the U.S. embargoed list. Iran is a very bureaucratic country and only recently it has opened its markets to foreign companies. Iranian health care has improved a lot in recent years, but the country is falling behind in technical improvements. Iran needs foreign investments to update its system. For biotechnical companies, there exits business opportunities in Iran, they are just waiting to be discovered.

Such networks were fundamental in the spread of cultural artefacts and practice, as well as leading to migration between the cities. This collection of essays applies network analysis to commercial networks, focusing on the roles of kinship, origin, religion and business in creating and maintaining urban economies"--Provided by publisher.

The main purpose of this book is to explore the influence of reform on changes in China's economic relations with Japan after the late 1970s. There are three reasons for investigating the links between Chinese reform and bilateral economic relations at this particular juncture in history. First, in the past two decades reform has meant that China has enjoyed faster economic growth than Japan.
