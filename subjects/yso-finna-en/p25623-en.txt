Android Mobile Application for Student Enrollment System
Pehr Brahe Software Laboratory at Oulu University of Applied Sciences has researched how computer aided systems could be used to assist and prolong elderly people’s living at home. One result of their efforts is an implementation of a ubiquitous home environment server engine, the UbiHomeServer. The UbiHomeServer’s user interface is specifically designed to be clear, simple and easily approachable for elderly and not technology-aware persons. To allow a flexible, place and time independent and convenient usage, the UI needed to be adapted to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The objective of this thesis was to study the features of a few currently widely used mobile platforms to find out their applicability for this kind of application, and to implement a prototype application using one of the studied platforms. The thesis work was started by studying the research results achieved by the UbiHomeServer team, among which the requirements for the mobile platform and application were gathered. During the platform study the main information sources were application design and development guides and reference documentation provided by platform manufacturers. The main result of this thesis is a fully functional Android application which operates as a user interface to a ubiquitous home environment, allowing the user to interact with a variety of service providers and support personnel. The application which was developed is used by test persons in the field tests of a ubiquitous home environment. Later, when developing similar application on other platforms, for example iOS and Windows Phone, the application and this thesis can be used as a reference.

"This book is a collection of notes I created while learning Android programming in order to create my first Android app, "EquityYo! Stock and Fund Database". While I am no Android programming genius (that much is certain!), I thought it would be a good idea to gather together all of those tiny little programming tips and tricks I've found along the way and place them in one spot. I do not claim that everything in this book is 100% original and I fully admit to copy-and-pasting a few tidbits from the Android documentation and stackoverflow.com"--

Dogfight : how Apple and Google went to war and started a revolution
Nowadays mobile devices play a significant role in a modern human being's life. Today regular usage of cellphones is far beyond only making calls and texting messages. Rapid and constant development of mobile software platforms and their growing popularity attract third party developers to build new applications for such platforms. Equipped with variety of sensors, they have become powerful tools which help in various aspects of life, from entertaining and gaming to examining and keeping track of health. One such useful application of a cellphone could be turning it into a wireless mouse. Sometimes it happens that a computer mouse is forgotten at home and there is not a convenient substitute for it at the moment. However, a mobile phone is such an item which is always close at hand. This thesis aims at designing and creating an Android application prototype which allows using an Android device as a computer mouse. The project relies on data provided by an accelerometer sensor. This work covers relevant theoretical background, such as Verlet Integration, Bluetooth Architecture, data filtering, which are necessary for completing the application (prototype) and implementation details of key aspects of the project.

The open nature of the Android OS offers programmers the freedom to access the platform's capabilities and this straightforward guide walks you through the steps for creating amazing Android applications.
Abstract: This project was carried out for the Public Works Department of Helsinki City, and the purpose was to create a location-aware feedback application for the Android mobile platform. The created application was capable of interacting with a remote server and rendering the user interface at runtime depending upon data retrieved from the database. In addition, a web application was also required to be created to handle the database. The mobile application was developed in the Android platform using the Java programming language in Eclipse IDE. MYSQL was used for database design and PHP was used as a server side scripting language. The web application consisted of simple HTML pages with CSS and Javascript. During the project, a localized Android application, capable of accessing device features such as camera and GPS and creating the user interface dynamically, was developed. The web application was also created, and it acted as an interface for creating, viewing and modifying the data in the database. The developed Android application can be used effectively to get feedback from general citizens in workshops organized by the Public Works Department of Helsinki City in the form of general text, images and location information. As the application is localized, it is accessible to people using the Finnish, Swedish and English language.
Controlling a robot using Android interface and voice
The main aim of this thesis was to describe how a single UI code could be used in different operating systems. The objective in this thesis was to bring out the main key points how a hybrid HTML5 application can be implemented by using iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components as a container for a hybrid application. This thesis also describes how a data transfer is done between HTML, JavaScript and native code. As a starting point, a hybrid application was implemented in both Android and iOS platforms. I wanted to implement an application, which would give value for the end users. I studied some time for open web APIs and found out that Finnkino Movie Company was providing a free XML API for their services and the application idea was found. I interviewed some of my friends about the functional needs for the application and also about how the UI should look like. The application itself was designed to use only one platform specific native WebView component. The User Interface was built with the HTML elements and JavaScript because the UI should look the same in both platforms. In my application the native code handles the XML data parsing from the Finnkino’s web API and sends the parsed data to the calling JavaScript function, which will then place the data into the HTML elements dynamically. When the application was completed, all the differences between the platforms were studied and documented into this thesis. As a result iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components provide a good support for a hybrid application development with some minor differences. The main difference is the performance and how responsive the UI is in these platforms. From the development point of view, I see a great opportunity to implement mobile applications with a web technology, as it is a fast evolving environment introducing new possibilities for the developers in a very fast phase. And from the business point of view, I can see a great opportunity for smaller companies, or individual developers because with a single effort the application UI can be created for multiple platforms and this saves money and resources.

The aim of this Bachelors thesis was to implement an Android application for the company Visualligent Oy. This application was supposed to act as a base of a mobile game that Visualligent will create later. The base consists of landing page with different login methods and data management. The project started from scratch and the goal was to have a working application with features the commissioner wanted. This thesis describes the process of creating an Android application that uses MongoDB as its database and RESTful API to handle operations between database and application. Theoretical part of this paper covers mobile development and NoSQL databases in general. In addition, native Android development and MongoDB will be addressed more in detail. Application development is also documented with code examples and explanations. The result of this project is a working Android application that meets most of the requirements set by the client. User has possibility to log into application using Google or Facebook account or create a new in-game account. User information is stored in MongoDB database. The result of this thesis will hopefully benefit the actual game development process. This application can also be used in other projects that need similar functionalities.
