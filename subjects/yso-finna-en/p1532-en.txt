These findings from the Durham University research project which observed court cases involving Deaf people over three years, and carried out in-depth interviews with Deaf people and Interpreters, reveal that sign language court interpreters are often not qualified interpreters, or have had no specialist legal interpreting training. The highly skilled task is often poorly understood by other participants in court proceedings, and the difference between BSL and English imposes particular constraints and demands on the interpreter.

Cloud computing is not a particular information technology but a concept/channel of communications, sometimes compared to network services such as providing gas or electricity. Cloud computing, giving an opportunity to use IT infrastructure and tools as a service, not a product, has become one of the most influential tendency in a development of modern IT, being a popular method of outsourcing of IT services for companies and individuals. A paper identifies key regulatory problems presently faced by cloud computing. Then a paper delivers a general overview of existing EU legal provisions that can be applied to cloud computing. The application of current regulations to solving problems resulting from cloud computing is rather limited what was confirmed by an opinion on data protection in cloud computing announced in July 2012 by so called Article 29 Working Party. The further part of a paper brings the analysis of the Commission's initiatives concerning cloud computing. Commission's strategy on cloud computing seeks solutions of many issues related to cloud computing in future (currently under preparation) EU regulations such as so-called General Data Protection Regulation and others. The paper concludes that the EU's regulatory policy on cloud computing should be based on 'soft framework' (unbinding soft law and policy measures) rather than binding regulation..

Christianity's demographics, vitality, and influence have tipped markedly toward the global South and East. Addressing this seismic shift, one of today's leading Christian scholars reflects on what he has learned about justice through his encounters with world Christianity. Philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff's experiences in South Africa, the Middle East, and Honduras have shaped his views on justice through the years. In this book he offers readers an autobiographical tour, distilling the essence of his thoughts on the topic. After describing how he came to think about justice as he does and reviewing the theory of justice he developed in earlier writings, Wolterstorff shows how deeply embedded justice is in Christian Scripture. He reflects on the difficult struggle to right injustice and examines the necessity of just punishment. Finally, he explores the relationship between justice and beauty and between justice and hope. This book is the first in the Turning South series, which offers reflections by eminent Christian scholars who have turned their attention and commitments toward the global South and East.

"Vigorous public debate about intellectual property has a long history. In this assessment of the shifting relationships between the law and the economic, social and cultural sources of creativity and innovation during the long-nineteenth century, Megan Richardson and Julian Thomas examine the 'fashioning' of the law by focusing on emblematic cases, key legislative changes and broader debates. Along the way, the authors highlight how, in 'the age of journalism', the press shaped, and was shaped by, the idea of intellectual property as a protective crucible for improvements in knowledge and progress in the arts and sciences. The engagement in our own time between intellectual property and the creative industries remains volatile and unsettled. As the authors conclude, the fresh opportunities for artistic diversity, expression and communication offered by new media could see the place of intellectual property in the scheme of law being reinvented once again"--
