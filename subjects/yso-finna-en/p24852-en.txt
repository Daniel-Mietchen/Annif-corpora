"This book builds on the tradition of previous volumes produced from annual International Police Executive Symposium (IPES) meetings. Three sections highlight the themes of tourism; trafficking; strategic locations and public events; and illegal migration. A feature of this book is its commitment to give voice to police practitioners from developing countries and countries where English is a second language. It addresses these difficult yet vitally important areas of crime which are an ongoing global challenge and reflects a compilation of the most current international issues in policing"--

As one of the fastest growing trends in higher education, study abroad programs are having a critical impact on the educational landscape. While international study programs generate more revenue and promote campus diversity, there are several challenges that must be considered when integrating non-native students into native universities. Global Perspectives and Local Challenges Surrounding International Student Mobility explores comparative research regarding the implementation of effective strategies needed when working with native and non-native individuals in educational settings. Offering perspectives from international student experiences, as well as views on current mobility trends, immigration policies, and challenges with cultural expectations, this publication will be a critical source for educators, policymakers, and university staff who interact with international students.

"PES Preface The International Police Executive Symposium (IPES) was founded in 1994 to address one major challenge--the worlds of research and practice remain disconnected even though cooperation between the two is growing. A major reason is that the two groups speak in different languages. The research is published in hard-to-access journals and presented in a manner that is difficult for some to comprehend. On the other hand, police practitioners tend not to mix with researchers and remain secretive about their work. Consequently, there is little dialogue between the two and almost no attempt to learn from one another. The global dialog among police researchers and practitioners is limited. True, the literature on the police is growing exponentially, but its impact upon day-to-day policing is negligible. The aims and objectives of the IPES are to provide a forum to foster closer relationships among police researchers and practitioners on a global scale, to facilitate cross-cultural, international, and interdisciplinary exchanges for the enrichment of the law enforcement profession, to encourage discussion, and to publish research on challenging and contemporary problems facing the policing profession. One of the most important activities of the IPES is the organization of an annual meeting under the auspices of a police agency or an educational institution. Now in its 17th, year the annual meeting, a fiveday initiative on specific issues relevant to the policing profession, brings together ministers of interior and justice, police commissioners and chiefs, members of academia representing world-renown institutions, and many more criminal justice elite from over 60 countries"--
