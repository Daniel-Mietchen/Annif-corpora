"How reliable is our intuition? How much should we depend on gut-level instinct rather than rational analysis when we play the stock market, choose a mate, hire an employee, or assess our own abilities? In this engaging and accessible book, David G. Myers shows us that while intuition can provide us with useful - and often amazing - insights, it can also dangerously mislead us."--BOOK JACKET.

This thesis explores whether intuition is and can be used as a managerial tool, how it could be done and to what extent intuition is used by managers. The main aim is to explain intuition and its use to managers in a holistic manner. The definition of intuition used in the text can be summarised by Frances E. Vaughan: "At any given moment one is conscious of only a small portion of what one knows. Intuition allows one to draw on that vast storehouse of unconscious knowledge that includes not only everything that one has experienced or learned, either consciously or subliminally, but also the infinite reservoirs of the collective or universal unconscious, in which individual separateness and ego boundaries are transcended." (Agor 1986; 158)  The thesis presents the five ways of communication: verbal, physical, emotional, power and the more in-depth discussed intuitive communication. Three different kinds of intuition have also been recognised. These consist of subliminal observation, synthesizing and real intuition. The quantum skills are presented, since they encompass many issues concerning intuition. Intuition is seen as a mental skill, which can be developed and a few techniques, which enhance intuition are presented. The tools for recognising authentic intuition as well as a test on ones intuition have also been included.  How exactly the human mind work most effectively is essential for the thesis. The question rationality versus intuitiveness is brought forward. Research shows that the two concepts are much closer than commonly believed. Neither intuition nor rational thinking used on its own by managers imply effectiveness. However, the ones making use of their intuition sided with rational analysis seem to have a relation to effectiveness. The thesis discusses the research found applied to different managerial tasks. Finally, a need for a management model supporting both the rational and intuitive side of managers is brought forward as well as the need for further research is discussed.

Intuition is not some magical and mysterious property that arises unbidden from the depths of our mind. This book shows us how we can hone our instinctive ability to know in an instant, helping us to bring out the best in our thinking and become better decision-makers in our everyday life.

What is intuition? What constitutes an intuitive process? Why are intuition concepts important? After many years of scholarly neglect, interest in intuition is now exploding in psychology and cognitive science. Moreover, intuition is also enjoying a renaissance in philosophy. Yet no single definition of intuition appears in contemporary scholarship; there is no consensus on the meaning of this concept in any discipline. Rational Intuition focuses on conceptions of intuition in relation to rational processes. Covering a broad range of historical and contemporary contexts, prominent philosophers, psychologists, and cognitive scientists explore how intuition is implicated in rational activity in its diverse forms. In bringing the philosophical history of intuition into novel dialogue with contemporary philosophical and empirical research, Lisa M. Osbeck and Barbara S. Held invite a comparison of the conceptions and functions of intuition, thereby clarifying and advancing conceptual analysis across disciplines.
