In discussions of the issue of interpreter neutrality, the anecdotes that interpreters and laypeople share suggest that the traditional perception of the interpreter's role as a neutral conduit of language is at odds with people's real-life experiences. In order to examine ways in which ASL-English interpreters influence interactive discourse, it is important to recognize that not all interactive discourse is identical. Interactive discourse, as it is used here, refers to dialogic or multiparty interactions. In order to examine the sociolinguistic question of whether an interpreter can interpret interactive discourse without influencing it, this study has applied frame theory to two cases of interpreted encounters. Interpreters, like other participants, bring their own frames and schema to interpreted encounters. Moreover, analysis of interpreter-generated utterances that are not renditions of other-party discourse indicates that interpreters' contributions can be categorized into two types: relayings and interactional management.
