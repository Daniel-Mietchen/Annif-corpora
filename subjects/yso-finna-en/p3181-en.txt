"John Ruskin (1819-1900), one of the leading literary, aesthetic and intellectual figures of the middle and late Victorian period, and a significant influence on writers from Tolstoy to Proust, has established his claim as a major writer of English prose. This collection of essays brings together leading experts from a wide range of disciplines and contexts to analyse his ideas in the context of his life and work. Topics include Ruskin's Europe, architecture, technology, autobiography, art, gender and his rich influence even in the contemporary world. This is the first multi-authored expert collection to assess the totality of Ruskin's achievement and to open up the deep coherence of a troubled but dazzling mind. A chronology and guide to further reading contribute to the usefulness of the volume for students and scholars"--
