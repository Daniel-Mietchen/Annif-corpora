The focus of this Bachelor's thesis was to become acquainted with vertical MOS transistors and to develop a simulation model for a floating-gate MOSFET circuit. The goal was to develop a behavioral model of the circuit that could be used for simulating control voltage behavior with different gate charges at variable temperatures. In addition the model should be easily modified if different implementations are considered. The MOSFET circuit consists of two vertical DMOS transistors that have their gates connected to each other with a bonding wire. The floating gate stores electric charge. The first transistor functions as a MOS capacitor having its source and drain short-circuited. The charge level on the gate can be determined by increasing the control voltage at the shorted node of the MOS capacitor until the second MOS transistors channel opens to a predefined stage. The Measurements of a vertical DMOS transistor and the floating-gate MOSFET circuit were used as a basis for the transistor model. A low frequency C-V curve was measured and its behavior was replicated in the simulation model. The temperature effect on the input capacitance was also implemented into the MOS transistor model. The result was a behavioral simulation model that models the required control voltage level of the circuit as a function of temperature and gate charge. The achieved model is not adequately accurate but it offers knowledge for modeling the floating-gate MOSFET circuit.
