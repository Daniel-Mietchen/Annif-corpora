Deadly predators
Not Alone is an asymmetrical card game, in whitch one player (the creature) plays against the rest (the hunted). If you play as one of the Hunted, you will explore Artemia using Place cards. By playing these and Survival cards, you will try to avoid, confuse or distract the creature until help arrives. If you play as the Creature, you will stalk and pursue the shipwrecked survivors. By playing your hunt cards and using the mysterious powers of Artemia, you will try to wear down the Hunted and assimilate them to the planet forever.
