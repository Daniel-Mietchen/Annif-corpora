Financial statements : A crusade for current values
This paper examines an economic union where oligopolistic firms produce by skilled and unskilled labor and do R&D by skilled labor. The planner of the union accepts new members to the union, deregulates the product market through anti-trust policy and regulates the labor market through a minimum wage for unskilled labor. Firms and workers lobby the planner for prospective policy. It is shown that in the political equilibrium small unions apply product market deregulation, but large unions labor market deregulation. When an economic union grows, it will replace regulation by deregulation in the labor market.

This study overviews the current state of the Chinese state enterprises and bank reforms.Transformation of command economy into market economy has until recently been relatively frictionless, at least in retrospective to other command economies. Recently economic growth has become sluggish which has been blamed on structural factors.Corporate governance reform is recognized as the next key issue of reforms.Despite the economic weight of state owned enterprises is diminishing, the financial sector is heavily linked to the SOE.The current economic woes result from the reckless lending practices, the money was given to those with political influence instead of those deserving.Now, the amount of bad debt is threatening the stability of the financial sector. Institutions required for effective corporate governance are emerging.However, the state wants to retain control over the former state owned enterprises, which hinders the proper functioning of the market.Piecemeal reforms do not appear to suffice and there are some serious doubts of the capacity to finance the reforms.  Keywords: China, Economic Reforms, State Owned Enterprises, Corporate Control .

The aim of study was to investigate the petroleum companies in Iran and research the prospects, current security issues and some operational suggestions for Abloy Oy in the focused market. The qualitative method was utilized to obtain first-hand and in-depth primary information through online interviews and phone calls. The results showed that national Iranian oil companies are the main actors in the market while using mostly human based security personnel and not much of automatized systems, thus creating an opportunity for Abloy Oy to expand and develop its market share. However, the complicated culture of the public sector in Iran could create some barrier to cooperation, making it essential for Abloy Oy to use the assistance of a local, competent, and experienced agent to make this potential and profitable market accessible.

Energy giant NovusCorp has developed the tech to transport people from the past to the present day, and they have just moved the lost population of Pompeii to a replica city. Historian Nick Houghton is brought in to study the Romans, but he soon realises that NovusCorp are underestimating their captives. The Romans may be ignorant of modern technology, but they once ruled an empire. The stage is set for the ultimate clash of cultures.
