The environmental potential of hybrid buses in transit city traffic : comparison of various bus models in terms of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions
The aim of this thesis was to analyze the environmental potential of hybrid busses by comparing the fuel consumption and the tailpipe emissions of several diesel hybrid and diesel bus models. At the beginning the different bus models were chosen and in the following their performance on a drive cycle was calculated. Sources for information were books, the internet and some manufacturer data. The results showed that a reduction of about 31 to 35% in fuel consumption and emission is possible. Nevertheless the theoretical values have to be handled with caution. Actual measurement values with an actual bus performing the drive cycle on a chassis dynamometer are also needed to verify the theoretical data.
