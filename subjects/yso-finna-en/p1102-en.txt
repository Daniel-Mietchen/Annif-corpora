Trekking the Dolomites
"Martha Wells expands her world of the Raksura with the start of a brand new Three Worlds series. An expedition of groundlings from the Empire of Kish have traveled through the Three Worlds to the Indigo Cloud court of the Raksura, shape-shifting creatures of flight that live in large family groups. The groundlings have found a sealed ancient city at the edge of the shallow seas, near the deeps of the impassable Ocean. They believe it to be the last home of their ancestors and ask for help getting inside. But the Raksura fear it was built by their own distant ancestors, the Forerunners, and the last sealed Forerunner city they encountered was a prison for an unstoppable evil. Prior to the groundlings' arrival, the Indigo Cloud court had been plagued by visions of a disaster that could destroy all the courts in the Reaches. Now, the court's mentors believe the ancient city is connected to the foretold danger. A small group of warriors, including consort Moon, an orphan new to the colony and the Raksura's idea of family, and sister queen Jade, agree to go with the groundling expedition to investigate. But the predatory Fell have found the city too, and in the race to keep the danger contained, the Raksura may be the ones who inadvertently release it. The Edge of Worlds, from celebrated fantasy author Martha Wells, returns to the fascinating world of The Cloud Roads for the first book in a new series of strange lands, uncanny beings, dead cities, and ancient danger"--

Many questions in animal biology require the ability to track animal movement by using multi-disciplinary and technological innovations. Over the past decade, intrinsic chemical markers have become especially key in the study of migration. Stable isotopes are a successful example of instrinic markers that have yielded new and valuable insights into animal migration. This book provides a consolidated overview of the current knowlesge of stable isotopes in terrestrial migration research questions, and to provide a practical handbook for those considering using stable isotopes in their migration research. * Presents information for readers to understand how to apply isotopic methods for tracking * Critical information on areas for future research * Practical guidelines and discussions of sample collection, sample preparation, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry data analysis, and issues of isotopic exchange and heterogeneity * Enhanced understanding of data and statistical analysis in isotope-based studies of migratory animals

NATURAL HISTORY, COUNTRY LIFE & PETS. To the River is the story of the Ouse, the Sussex river in which Virginia Woolf drowned in 1941. One idyllic, midsummer week over sixty years later, Olivia Laing walked Woolf's river from source to sea. The result is a passionate investigation into how history resides in a landscape - and how ghosts never quite leave the places they love.
