Cardiovascular/respiratory physiotherapy
The book discusses new concepts and findings in the field of pulmonary function. This function is notably associated with spirometry and gas exchange at the lungs. The technique of spirometry, its clinical meaning, and reference values have all been refined over decades of its use. Although spirometry remains ancillary in diagnosis-making, it seems hardly replaceable in monitoring of lung disease progression and treatment efficacy. Pulmonary function goes far beyond spirometry. It encompasses interactions with the cardiovascular system, sleep disordered breathing, etiological factors like occupational bio aerosol exposure or cigarette smoke related issues. Pulmonary function may crumple in any respiratory ailment, the case in point being all too often respiratory tract infections. Chapters contribute to the latest thinking on molecular mechanisms underpinning pulmonary function, on patient care and attempt to keep up-to-date with current clinical and research progress. The book will be of interest to both clinicians and biomedical researchers.

"Written by physicians, General Medicine for Physical Therapists introduces the basic principles of internal medicine and general pathology clearly and comprehensively for physical therapy (PT) students and practitioners-essential for understanding disease patterns and symptoms as well as diagnostic procedures and medical therapies. For practitioners of physical therapy, exercise physiology, massage therapy, and other allied health disciplines, it is a reliable and easy-to-use reference that will help them fully understand their patients' medical conditions and provide the highest levels of care" -- Provided by publisher.
Watson's medical-surgical nursing and related physiology
With this user-friendly book at hand, students and PT practitioners will have the knowledge to identify underlying medical conditions, develop individualized treatment plans that take these factors into account, achieve sound therapeutic goals, and refer patients to other resources where necessary.Special Features: The only general medicine book for physical therapists written with the in-depth knowledge and experience of practicing MDs Organized in two logical sections: the first, General Pathology, provides a basic foundation in the origin and course of diseases, cardinal signs and symptoms, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; the second, Internal Medicine, focuses on anatomy, physiology, and diagnosis of pathologies found in different organ systems,with a concentration on diseases that are treated with physical therapy Presents the information in concise summary form but with enough detail to enable PTs to accurately screen and diagnose patients Offers nearly 300 full-color, didactic illustrations that serve as a superb visual aid to learning Includes numerous tables, chapter summaries, a glossary of medical terminology, and dozens of case studies that make every concept clear and accessible Assists in exam preparation by furnishing dozens of study questions and answers Now a major part of the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate physical therapy programs, internal medicine and general pathology are part of the basic equipment" of the physical therapist. For PT students, this book will be a training guide throughout their studies and a valuable review as they prepare for examinations.
