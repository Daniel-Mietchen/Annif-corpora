Abstract: The purpose of our study was to explore the experiences of Chinese immigrants living in the Metropolitan area in Finland on the Finnish health care services and does it meet their needs. The study is part of the LOG-Sote project (Local and Global development in the social and health care), which aims to improve the health care services in Finland towards more immigrant friendly direction. Increasing knowledge about new cultures improves the interaction with patients from different cultural environments and social backgrounds. The Chinese immigrants are the fifth biggest immigrant group in Finland and their experiences on the Finnish health care services have not been explored before. Fourteen individual interviews were conducted during September and October 2011. All the participants were Chinese who are living in the Metropolitan area in Finland. The participants arrived to Finland between the years 1989 and 2005 and the reasons for the arrival varied. The data collection method was semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions. Data was analyzed by using the inductive content analysis. The results showed that generally the Finnish health care services are valued and the system is good. The Chinese trusted the Finnish health care workers' professionalism and the quality of the care was high according to the participants. The Chinese immigrants felt valued and equal to the native Finns. Few of the participants said that the access to the services and the care received was better to the immigrants than to the Finns, nevertheless, majority of the participants had difficulties when accessing the care. They did not understand how the Finnish health care system works or where to seek help. Health care workers' lack of facial expressions leaded to feelings that the staff was cold towards the Chinese. Language created problems when accessing the care while communicating with the health care workers. Even though the language was a big problem, participants mentioned that the Finns have a good heart and are helpful in problematic situations. The results of the study indicate that cultural competence should be increased among the Finnish health care staff in order to respond the needs of the immigrant groups from different backgrounds. Information on the Finnish health care should be provided in multiple languages so that the access and understanding of the system would be easier. The health care workers should encounter the patient with smile and show emotions on their faces.

Abstract: Multicultural or Transcultural nursing is globally an important aspect of nursing today. it is very important for all healthcare providers to be aware of the existence of cultural differences and appreciate the differences of multiple and various differentiations in healthcare values, beliefs and customs. This knowledge helps in providing a holistic care to the patients. This final project was a part of the LOG-Sote a large research project that focuses on the health issues of ethnic minorities. The purpose of this final project study was to describe patients and families experiences of healthcare services received in multicultural environment. Eight research articles were used for the literature review. The data were collected systematically from OVID, CINAHL AND PUBMED. The articles found described the patients and family members' experiences in different healthcare environment. Two categories and subcategories were found in the patients' and families' experiences. Stress and culture; they are faced with overwhelming stress such as fear about uncertain outcomes of illness, lack of communication and information, changes in roles and responsibility, vulnerability, emotional turmoil and financial concerns, disappointments from the healthcare setting and societal discrimination and migration. However, they depend on their cultural beliefs and values, it protection and their religious practices and this also increase the anxiety. Majority of the participants had experienced stress and felt they had been treated in a biased way. Few participant in the research articled analyzed expressed satisfaction in the care received. Hospitalized patients and families are subjected to stress and this invariably affects the quality of care they receive. This signifies there is a need for more educational awareness in multiculturalism and in its competence.

Over the past 40 years, the health humanities, previously called the medical humanities, has emerged as one of the most exciting fields for interdisciplinary scholarship, advancing humanistic inquiry into bioethics, human rights, health care, and the uses of technology.

This book assembles a rich body of work that has emerged in the field, and presents fresh approaches to the health humanities as portrayed in these 45 original essays that truly humanize the health profession

"The contemporary relevance of Diversity, Ethnicity, Migration and Work is evident in debates on migration, racism and the global market in healthcare workers. This book is about work and workers in the health care sector across three continents and in particular the UK, the USA and Nigeria. The book engages with the politics of health care and offers important insights into inequalities in employment and health care. It is informed by current thinking on migration, ethnicity and work, including critical engagement with the literature on diasporas, social networks, social processes, anti-racism and diversity management. The authors provide an historical and global perspective before engaging deeply with the working experience of highly qualified international migrants and low paid migrant and minority workers. They provide unique comparative and intersectional insights into the experience of migrant doctors compared to UK and US qualified doctors and deepen this understanding by an exploration of women doctors' experiences. The story of frontline low paid migrant and black and minority ethnic workers is told drawing on social processes and the means of challenging inequalities through trade unions and social networks. The book concludes with a critical and comparative appraisal of diversity management strategies."
