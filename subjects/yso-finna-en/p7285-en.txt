This paper provides a general assessment of transport network of the St.Petersburg region and examines the possibilities for collaboration between Russia and Finland in utilizing and enhancing the function of this network.Treating transport infrastructure as a precondition to certain forms of international economic relations, the authors argue that in recent years the transport network under review has become increasingly inadequate to handle the changing and growing needs of economic collaboration between the two countries. Nevertheless, prospects for the future are not entirely gloomy. Russia, Finland and many other countries stand to benefit substantially from the development of the transport infrastructure in the St.Petersburg region.Therefore a number of joint projects have currently been started to remedy the situation. .

Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

Abstract: The purpose of the thesis was to find elements in marketing the express companies in the case study could use as a differentiation method within the local Finnish market. Express logistics companies are global logistics providers that have overnight delivery capability. The study was commissioned by one of the companies, DHL Express. The qualitative method was used to conduct this study. Qualitative data was collected by a series of semi-structured interviews of express company customers. Four customers were interviewed so that relevant data could be extracted from all different companies in the market. All answers to the interviews differ from one another, a phenomenon common to semi-structured interviews, there were a few answers in common to all of them that allows the author to draw some general conclusions. Customer interviews revealed that the company local image comes mainly from their local product portfolio and the salesperson activities. Their improvement suggestions from customers mainly concern the products and their versatility, and also the personal touch in both products and customer service. Customer service was seen as part of the product. Improvement suggestions to sales contacts were to invest more in quality of the contacts and not the amount, and also the customers like to be taken seriously, and not for granted. In addition the author recommends that express companies involve the customer to the future advancements in both systems and products, to get the highest amount of customer satisfaction possible. Further improvements need to be made for training of both customer service individuals, sales people and marketing staff, also their actions need constant monitoring. According to this study the future products should possibly include different “building blocks” that customer can use to personalize the products to their needs. Furthermore future training of customer service and sales should include more of basic knowledge of human nature and emotional intelligence than just plain sales tactics. Marketing staff should also be trained to produce material with greater impact and quality.

The study makes an effort to elaborate the question, how Russian political, geopolitical and economic dependencies and aspirations may influence transit transport flows related to the trade between the European Union and Russia, and on Russian decisions to invest in transport infrastructures.The factors influencing on the choice of export transit transport corridors range from a number of long-term economic and geo-political security considerations of the Russian energy sector to a short-term needs to exert pressures to gain political benefits.Thus, three factors seem to have a major impact on the direction and volume the transit transport: 1) Russian national geo-strategic security considerations aiming at the maintenance of economic autarchy and spheres of interest, 2) the structure of trade between the European Union and Russia, and 3) the unwillingness of Russia to purchase from the new border republics transit transport services, available for free during the FSU era.Finally, the study contains statistics on the volumes and values of the transit transport flows between the European Union and Russia by commodity groups and by corridors (Ukraine-Slovakia, Poland-Belarus, Lithuania-Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland). .

Abstract: The aim of supply chain management is the delivery and service chain optimization, cost reduction, increase in sales and enhanced customer service. In the Nordic countries, where the distances are long, it is normally necessary to maintain inventories. Another reason for inventories is often uncertainty. Inventories must be maintained as customers want fast shipping, but do not tell in advance when and how much they are going to buy different products. The supply chain management is a very practical activity. It is not solved by using statistical models, or by the IT systems. The most important part of the chain, are the people. The employees should, however, use mathematics and systems to help improve the efficiency of the supply chain.    The purpose of this work was to review old and define new purchasing parameters for Pernod Ricard Finland Oy and create a continuous process to define the parameters for the company by using mathematical and statistical methods. The goal of this research was to get better understanding of planning fluctuations and improve and define the planning parameters with fact based knowledge.    An action research study was carried out during autumn 2012 and spring 2013. This work initially examined the various theories to improve purchasing parameters, in particular the management of the safety stocks, and determined what kind of planning method should be used for planning various types of products in order to generate the best possible forecast with right information to suppliers and other parties.    Based on the theory new parameters for the purchase of Pernod Ricard Finland Oy were defined for certain products, implemented into system and the results were analyzed after few months. As the results of the research trial were promising the final result of the project was a new process and guidelines on how the purchasing parameters will be defined in the company.
