"Pediatric Sonography, Fourth Edition gives you a complete working knowledge of the latest scanning technologies and the clinical applications of ultrasound in pediatric and adolescent patients. Readers will find just the guidance they need to determine the most appropriate imaging method for evaluating a specific clinical problem, conduct the sonographic examination, and interpret the findings. The book shows the sonographic appearance of normal anatomy and disease processes within each organ system and points out technical and interpretive artifacts and errors that can affect evaluations. This edition features more than 1,800 clear, sharp images, including over 300 full-color images throughout. Other highlights include discussions of the uses and limitations of mobile instrumentation and expanded coverage of ultrasound-guided interventional procedures"--Provided by publisher.

The aim of this thesis was to study the effects of sound reverberation on noise levels in the gymnastics areas of the new sports hall. The sports club commissioned this thesis after identifying a problem in the new sports hall, as the gymnasts reported that background noise due to poor acoustics was disturbing their concentration and speech intelligibility. The sound reverberation time was measured to find out the acoustic response. The reverberation time was measured in three large open gymnastic areas that are separated from each other by walls. The results of the measurements show that reverberation times in two out of the three gymnastic areas exceed the recommended limits on voice frequencies. Only one gymnastics area had values inside the limits. Based on the results, the conclusion can be drawn that long reverberation is increasing the background noise. As an improvement, installation of acoustic panels or intermediate curtains is proposed in order to reduce the reverberation in the gymnastic areas. Acoustic panels should be attached to the sound-reflective walls in such a way that at least two adjacent perpendicular walls are paneled. Each of the gymnastic areas should be paneled in this way. Roof paneling is optional since the soft training platforms on the floor are sufficient to decrease the vertical reverberation.
