Part exploration, part knowledge building, and part narration, Work and the Older Person: Increasing Longevity and Well-Being draws on the latest research from a variety of disciplines and resources to paint a complete picture of productivity in old age. Dr. Linda A. Hunt and Caroline E. Wolverson, along with 11 contributors, discuss the relationship between work and aging and highlight the importance of working into old age. Each chapter of Work and the Older Person focuses on narratives from older workers that support the evidence presented with personal stories. These stories illustrate the opportunities, challenges, frustrations, and choices that older people face in maintaining a productive lifestyle. Simultaneously, the text highlights current events and the economy largely within Western societies and discusses the struggle some countries have supplying the financial benefits paid to retirees. Overall, the text shows how working into old age can contribute to longevity and greater quality of life. Occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, gerontologists, social workers, psychologists, and those working with older people in the health and social care sector will appreciate the inspiring accounts from older workers discussing how work contributes to their self-identity, quality of life, health, and well-being. Work and the Older Person: Increasing Longevity and Well-Being shows how engaging in occupations brings purpose to people's lives. The text will be of value to all professionals working with older adults, as well as older adults themselves looking to maintain a productive lifestyle.

"This book explores the adoption of 'active ageing' policies by EU15 nations and the impact on older peoples' work and retirement policy options. It explores the labour market policies (including unemployment benefits, active labour market policies and partial pension receipt) and pension policies (pension principles, early retirement and incentives for deferral) adopted by these nations from the mid-1990s onwards, addressing three main questions. First, to what extent was the EU's vision of 'active ageing' adopted in EU15 nations between 1995 and 2010? Second, what was the nature of policy reforms in these nations over this time period? Finally, which sub-groups within the older age cohort were subject to active ageing policies in these countries? The data indicate convergence towards the EU-vision of active ageing is complex, with nations adopting a variety of different reforms and policy mixes, which in turn focus on different groups within the older age cohort." --

This book focuses on the aging workforce from the employment relationship perspective. This innovative book specifically focuses on how organizations can ensure their aging workers remain motivated, productive, and healthy. In 15 chapters, several experts on this topic describe how organizations through effective human resource management can ensure that workers are able to continue working at higher age. In addition, this book discusses the role older workers themselves play in continuing work at higher age. To do this, the authors integrate research from different areas, such as literature on leadership, psychological contracts, and diversity with literature on the aging workforce. Through this integration this book provides innovative ways for organizations and workers to maintain productivity, motivation and health. Aging Workers and the Employee-Employer Relationship summarizes the latest research on how employment relationships change with age and its implications for supporting the well-being, motivation, and productivity of older workers. It identifies ways to improve how both companies and workers solve the problems they face. These include better designed employment practices and more adaptive job content and developmental opportunities for aging workers along with activities aging workers can engage to enhance their own job crafting, learning and employability.
