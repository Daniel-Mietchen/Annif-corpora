"These proceedings are the fourth in the series of International Conferences covering fission and properties of neutron-rich nuclei, which are at the forefront of nuclear structure research. The time interval of 5 years between each conference allows for significant new results to be achieved. Recently, world leaders in theory and experiments in research and the development of new facilities for research presented their latest results in areas such as synthesis of superheavy elements, new facilities for and recent results with radioactive ion beams, structure of neutron-rich nuclei, nuclear fission process, fission yields and nuclear astrophysics. This book is a major source of the latest research in these areas and plans for the future. The conference brought together a unique group of over 100 speakers including the directors of the major nuclear laboratories in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the US along with leading research scientists from around the world."--BOOK JACKET.
