It is commonly held in the media that hedge funds are tremendous financial products able to fructify money in a very short time. While the assumption may be correct because hedge managers are often wealthy, it omits the fact that hedge funds are not all able to produce vast returns in the short run. For this reason, I became interested in the evaluation of hedge fund performance and in their strategies. The thesis sought to identify which hedge fund strategy is the most fruitful and which hedge fund strategy is the least. I have written this thesis using qualitative methods along with the use of statistics measurements to evaluate performance. I have approached hedge funds from a historical viewpoint and have broken down the strategies in order to understand their functioning. Then the thesis ran through the characteristics of the strategy groups and broke them down in order to understand the particularities of each strategy. Lastly, statistical performance of the funds was studied with the intention of identifying which strategy is the most effective and which strategy performs the least. The theoretical background explored the history of hedge funds, the tools used by hedge funds and the investment strategies. Statistical theoretical background has also been researched to serve as a stepping stone for the testing of hedge fund strategies. Quantitative statistical data on 10 of the most common hedge fund strategies has been obtained from the Hedgefund Research Inc. hedge fund database organization. The results of the study showed that hedge funds focusing their investment strategy on emerging markets outperform every other tested strategy as well as traditional investments. On the other hand, hedge funds that are exclusively short sellers have been coming out as the funds with the least returns. It can be said that emerging markets have provided the ideal theater for high growth, which can explain why they have generated such performance. Alternatively hedge funds that have solely used short selling as a tool for generating profits may have been unable to generate as much growth because of the strategy's one-sided exposure to upward market trends. Key words: hedge fund, investments, stocks, bonds, stock market, financial markets.
