Depression in children and adolescents
"The seventh edition of Basic Child Psychiatry has been completely revised and updated to take account of advances in this fascinating and important subject. The opening chapters set the scene with developmental considerations, epidemiology and assessment. Coverage includes causal factors and reflects the progress made in the understanding of the genetics of child psychiatric disorders. The main body of the book guides the reader through the major disorders. The final chapters address child abuse and neglect, treatment approaches and prevention. References are provided to enable readers to locate more information on subjects they wish to pursue further. The book refers to the widely used systems of classifying psychiatric disorders - the World Health Organisation's ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) - and provides a succinct orientation chapter on these systems." -- (Back Cover)

This was the bland phrase used to describe Luise’s sudden death in the psychiatric ward at Amager Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was 32. Dear Luise is a mother’s deeply personal account of her struggle to ensure her daughter’s survival through 20 years of treatment in the Danish mental health system. It is an alarming – and thoroughly documented – exposé of the abject failure of the medication-based treatment regimen routinely imposed on vulnerable psychiatric patients. This book is also a poignant tale of love and hope, brimming with tender memories of the creativity, originality and wry humor of a very capable, intelligent young woman.

Traditional therapy can often be an off-putting experience for boys as it is in direct opposition to the ways they generally interact and connect with others. This book explores a variety of creative approaches that professionals can use to enhance the clinical experience and better reach their young male clients. Chapters discuss the theory behind and implementation of various creative approaches to therapy with boys, such as play therapy, including sports, movement, and gross-motor activity; animal-assisted therapy; the use of video games and computers; the use of superheroes in role play, metaphor, and play therapy; and art therapy. Attention is also given to methods for working with several subgroups of boys that require specialized treatment approaches, including gender variant and sexual minority boys and boys with ADHD. The first book of its kind, mental health professionals will find this a comprehensive and highly valuable text to help them understand, help, and support boys and their development.

"This Handbook illustrates the importance of examining child mental health from a different perspective, one that assumes that psychiatric categories are made real in and through both written and spoken language. It gathers a range of applied and theoretical analyses from leading scholars and clinicians in order to examine the conversational practices of children diagnosed with mental health disorders alongside those of their parents, families and practitioners. The contributors move away from viewing mental illness as an objective truth; instead reintroducing the relevance of language in constructing and deconstructing the assumptions that surround the diagnosis and treatment of childhood mental health disorders. Including chapters on ADHD, autism, depression, eating disorders and trauma, this collection addresses the diversity involved in discussing child mental health.Divided into six parts: the place of conversation/discourse analysis; critical approaches; social constructions of normal/abnormal; situating and exploring the difficulties involved; managing problem behaviour and discussing different practices involved; this Handbook presents a comprehensive overview of child mental health. It is an essential reference resource for all those involved or interested in child mental health"--
