Human resource management (HRM) can aid nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in facing uncertain, changing environments of funding pressures, increasing competition and demand for services as well as internal challenges. As the distinguishing features of NPOs can render the professionalization of HRM different from the private and public sectors, this book fills a gap in the literature by offering an in-depth look at how this distinctive nature of NPOs shapes the development and implementation of their HR practices. Timely and topical, this book addresses the professionalization of HRM in the nonprofit sector using examples from an exploratory multiple case study of NPOs selected across different fields. Not only does it offer both students and practitioners in the field of HRM and nonprofit management a better understanding of the specific challenges for HRM that stem from the management of several, contradictory bottom lines in NPOs, but it also highlights the opportunities that distinguishing nonprofit features create for the development and implementation of HR practices. By illustrating how NPOs can invest in learning and adapting processes that aid them in the alteration of HRM, this book is an essential resource for those involved in designing, implementing and studying HRM in NPOs.

The authors explore some of the ways in which standardisation, ideology and linguistics are interrelated. Through a number of case studies they show how concepts such as grammaticality and structural change covertly rely on a false conceptualisation of language, one that derives ultimately from standardisation.
