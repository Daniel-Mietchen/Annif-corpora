Toward a practice-based framework of technology acceptance : a case study on bioactive point of care testing
The purpose of this study was to determine if differences existed when dysarthric speech was evaluated using three measures, intelligibility, comprehensibility and acceptability using younger and older typical adults as listeners. Intelligibility, an objective measure, was defined as percent of words heard correctly, comprehensibility, also an objective measure, as the ability to understand what is being said, and acceptability, a subjective measure, as how the listener rates the person's overall speaking ability. Four young adult males with traumatic brain injury and one control were recorded reading sentences from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS). Sentences were played back to younger and older listeners who provided all ratings. All ratings by both groups were high for intelligibility and comprehensibility. Ratings for acceptability indicated a group difference with older listeners rating acceptability similar to intelligibility and comprehensibility, while younger listeners rated acceptability at significantly lower levels compared to the other to measures. Results suggest that counseling may be necessary for younger TBI patients and their families to overcome possible peer rejection despite the fact that the patients actually produce highly intelligible and understandable speech.
