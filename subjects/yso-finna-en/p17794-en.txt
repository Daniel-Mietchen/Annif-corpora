"Reflecting the latest innovations in the development of PM motors for electromechanical drives, Permanent Magnet Motor Technology: Design and Applications, Third Edition demonstrates the construction of PM motor drives and supplies ready-to-implement solutions to common roadblocks along the way. This up-to-date edition supplies fundamental equations and calculations for determining and evaluating system performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost. It explores modern computer-aided design of PM motors, including the finite element approach, and explains how to select PM motors to meet the specific requirements of electrical drives. The numerous examples, models, and diagrams provided in each chapter facilitate a lucid understanding of motor operations and characteristics."--BOOK JACKET.

Do current electricity market designs ensure a sufficient electricity supply at all times? This topic is currently the subject of intense debate across Europe, and several major countries such as Germany, the UK, France and Italy have decided that additional measures - so-called capacity remuneration mechanisms - are needed to supplement current market designs. This report describes and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of a range of measures proposed or currently implemented across Europe, and includes both best estimates of how the implementation of these measures will impact Nordic electricity prices as well as recommendations to the Nordic countries regarding a cost-efficient path to ensuring the Nordic security of supply.

This Bachelor's thesis was commissioned by the Degree Programme in Information Technology in HAMK University of Applied Sciences. The aim of the study was to take a look at EMC Shielding, how it is applied and what different options there are for designers and manufacturers. This thesis also takes a look at EMC in general. In addition, it takes also discusses the EMC Directive currently in use in the EU and the requirements that need to be met before an electronic apparatus can be put into use. The main sources used for this thesis were relevant literature and also some documents found on the Internet.    The outcome of this thesis resulted in an information package that has useful knowledge about setting up EMC shielding in projects that involve electronics. Electromagnetic interference has become a serious challenge for circuit designers, and it will most likely become an even bigger problem in the future.
