The digital era provides researchers with greatly enhanced ability to analyze and share data, but a new report warns that technology also makes it easier for data to be distorted. The report, from the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, recommends that research institutions ensure that every investigator receives appropriate training on managing data responsibly. Further, the report urges these institutions, along with professional societies, journals and research sponsors, to develop standards for ensuring the integrity of research data and specific data-management guidelines to account for new technologies.
