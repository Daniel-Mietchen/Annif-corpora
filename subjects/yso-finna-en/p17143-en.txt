The promise of world tensions
Development as freedom
In our rapidly globalising age with economic growth occurring in almost every corner of the world, it is easy to forget that more than one billion people still live on less than one dollar a day. Poverty is the worst human rights crisis in the world today, denying millions of people their most basic rights. Enriched by compelling photographs from across the world, "The Unheard Truth" argues that poverty remains a global epidemic because we continue to define it as an economic problem whose only solution is foreign aid and investment. Irene Khan calls for a re-evaluation of this long-standing assumption to turn us towards confronting poverty as a human rights violation. Empowering the poor with basic rights of security is our only chance for eradicating poverty and giving freedom and dignity to those who have never experienced it.
