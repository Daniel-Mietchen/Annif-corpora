"This book explores the connections between sound and memory across all electronic media, with a particular focus on radio. Street explores our capacity to remember through sound and how we can help ourselves preserve a sense of self through the continuity of memory. In so doing, he analyzes how the brain is triggered by the memory of programs, songs, and individual sounds. He then examines the growing importance of sound archives, community radio and current research using GPS technology for the history of place, as well as the potential for developing strategies to aid Alzheimer's and dementia patients through audio memory"--

This is the first book to consider frequently misunderstood form of communication - controversy has raged for 100 years as to sign language suitabilitys for the teaching of the deaf. The three sections of this book examine recent research on the main aspects of BSL. It is examined in its educational context and as a language its own right from the theoretical linguists' and psycholinguistics' viewpoint; there is also a contribution from a prelingually deaf researcher of the social importance of BSL to the deaf community, and a chapter on the skilled art of simultaneous interpreting from normal speech to sign language.
