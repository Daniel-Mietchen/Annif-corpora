Twentieth-century furniture design
"The projects of Remy Meijers radiate a soothing calm, they shine in simplicity and look like they have always been there. That is not self-evident in itself, but lies in his method. The Rotterdam-born Meijers is not just a designer. He works from a comprehensive vision whereby each element to be addressed. He will not rest until all icing on the cake stand. His interiors are balanced, the sober off, a quality of life is paramount in all cases. This book is a selection of his finest projects, a villa in the dunes, a mansion on the water and an apartment on the IJ in Amsterdam a beautifully renovated bungalow Rietveld. Agreement between the various projects it is clear which character form and function are closely aligned. Or to the interior architect himself speak: 'I come from rest to rest.'"--Publisher's website.
