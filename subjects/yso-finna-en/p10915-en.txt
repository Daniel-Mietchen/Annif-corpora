Teach yourself etching : a manual for students, artists and collectors. Herbert Cutner
Masters and method : Tal R, 2008
"Throughout the eighteenth century, a large number of artists-painters, sculptors, draftsmen, and amateurs-experimented with etching, a highly accessible printmaking technique akin to drawing. Some, like Antoine Watteau and François Boucher, encountered the process within the thriving commerce of the Paris print market. Others, like Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Hubert Robert, experimented with the technique during their student years in Rome. Over the course of the century, the free and improvisational aesthetic of the etching process increasingly was embraced, and French artists looked to seventeenth-century masters, such as Rembrandt in the north, and Salvator Rosa and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione to the south, for inspiration. The expressive potential of the technique was also explored in a more experimental manner by artists like Gabriel de Saint-Aubin and Louis Jean Desprez, who harnessed the inky tonalities of the medium to their personal and idiosyncratic vision."--The Metropolitan Museum of Art website.

The early modern painter-etcher
The etchings collected in this volume, which date from 1999 to the present, stem from the same impetus used for his large assemblages made of such materials as fruits, plastic bags, bottles, or old shoes, as well as for his collages of images from porno magazines, history books, and art catalogues. In these works on paper, Tal R continues to pursue his unique way of writing history, and eroticism, citations of nature, and political commentary continue to be important themes. Tal R's visual world is revealed in an especially clear manner in the formal reduction of visual ideas, sketches, and inventive forms of his etchings.---
