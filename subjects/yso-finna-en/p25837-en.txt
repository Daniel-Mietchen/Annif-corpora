green roofs
Snail sampling on a vegetated roof in downtown Helsinki resulted in four snail species of preference for moist habitats: Cochlicopa lubrica, Oxyloma elegans, Pseudotrichia rubiginosa, Succinella oblonga. The latter two are considered rare in Finland. In both species this is the second verified locality from the country. We provide drawings on genital morphology of O. elegans and S. oblonga and briefly discuss the potential of green roofs as habitats for invertebrates.
