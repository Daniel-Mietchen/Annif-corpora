The basic mechanisms of weldability are described and methods to improve weldability are described. Specific topics include solidification and liquation cracking, solid-state cracking, hydrogen cracking, fracture and fatigue, and corrosion. Methods for interpretation of weld failures using computational and characterization techniques are described"--

Traditional technology. Metallurgy
The study of ancient metals in their social and cultural contexts has been a topic of considerable interest in archaeology and ancient history for decades, partly due to the modern dependence on technology and man-made materials. The formal study of Archaeometallurgy began in the 1970s-1980s, and has seen a recent growth in techniques, data, and theoretical movements. This comprehensive sourcebook on Archaeometallurgy provides an overview of earlier research as well as a review of modern techniques, written in an approachable way. Covering an extensive range of archaeological time-periods and regions, this volume will be a valuable resource for those studying archaeology worldwide.
