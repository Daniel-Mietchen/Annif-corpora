"Comprehensive Behavior Management: Schoolwide, Classroom, and Individualized Approaches supports teachers in preventing management problems and responding to unwanted behavior when it occurs in classrooms. The text offers a comprehensive presentation of three levels of behavior management strategies: school-wide, classroom, and individual, all three of which contribute to a positive learning environment. A social learning emphasis, in which human behavior is viewed within an ecological framework, is integrated throughout the text. Application of this information is supported by a range of devices such as vignettes, examples, strategies, and activities to show teachers how to manage behavior effectively"--
Preventing classroom discipline problems : a guide for educators
Knowing where to draw the line : ethical and legal standards for best classroom practice
"Managing Pupil Behaviour provides routes through the classroom management maze to help practising and aspiring teachers learn to manage behaviour effectively in their classrooms. Using Terry Haydn's unique 10-point scale, it encourages teachers to think about the degree to which they are relaxed and in assured control of their classrooms and can enjoy their teaching. Drawing on the views of over 140 teachers and 700 pupils, it provides insights into the factors which enable teachers to manage learning effectively in their classrooms, so that pupils can learn and achieve, and teachers can enjoy their work. Key issues explored include the factors that influence the working atmosphere in the classroom, the impact of that atmosphere on teaching and learning, and tensions around inclusive practice and situations where some pupils may be spoiling the learning of others. This new edition has been fully updated to take account of recent research and inspection findings and includes a new chapter exploring the wide range of sophisticated skills that expert teachers deploy in order to get pupils to want to learn, and to enable teachers to work in classrooms where the climate is perfect for learning. Managing Pupil Behaviour will help all teachers ensure 'the right to learn' for all the pupils in their care and to think about different ways to approach this vitally important aspect of their working lives"--

"The field of classroom management is not a neatly organized line of inquiry, but rather consists of many disparate topics and orientations that draw from multiple disciplines. Given the complex nature of the field, this comprehensive second edition of the handbook is an invaluable resource for those interested in understanding it. It provides the field with up-to-date summaries of research on the essential topics from the first edition, as well as fresh perspectives and chapters on new topics. It is the perfect tool for both graduate students and practitioners interested in a field both fascinating and not immediately accessible without the proper guidance"--

"Previously referred to as the No Blame Approach, the pioneering work of George and Barbara has been popular among practitioners seeking an alternative method to punishment for dealing with bullying in their setting. This publication incorporates an updated edition of their bestselling, Crying for Help, and provides a clear practical guide and an explanation of the theory and values underpinning the work." "The publication includes George and Barbara's submission to the House of Commons Education Select Committee and a research report provided by Professor Peter K Smith who was commissioned to evaluate the use of the method."--BOOK JACKET.
Durkheim and Foucault : perpectives on education and punishment
Behavioral interventions in schools : a response to intervention guidebook
The recent exponential rise in the number of behaviour disorders has been the focus of a wide range of commentaries, ranging from the pedagogic and the administrative, to the sociological, and even the legal. This book will be the first to apply, in a systematic and thorough manner, the ideas of the foundational discipline of philosophy. A number of philosophical tools are applied here, tools arising through the medium of the traditional philosophical debates, such as those concerning governance, truth, logic, ethics, free-will, law and language. Each forms a separate chapter, but together they constitute a comprehensive, rigorous and original insight into what is now an important set of concerns for all those interested in the governance of children. The intention is threefold: first, to demonstrate the utility, accessibility and effectiveness of philosophical ideas within this important academic area. Philosophy does not have to be regarded an arcane and esoteric discipline, with only limited contemporary application, far from it. Second, the book offers a new set of approaches and ideas for both researchers and practitioners within education, a field is in danger of continually using the same ideas, to endlessly repeat the same conclusions. Third, the book offers a viable alternative to the dominant psychological model which increasingly employs pathology as its central rationale for conduct.
Focusing on educator facilitation of the development of self-control and responsibility in students, Successful Classroom Management and Discipline offers comprehensive yet concise coverage of the preventative aspects of classroom management, as well as a wide range of effective intervention strategies. In this Third Edition, authors Tom Savage and Martha K. Savage offer new and updated coverage of teacher stress, legal dimensions of management and discipline, teacher/family collaboration, and bullying. Key Features: Features a two-part structure to pinpoint the key dimensions of classroom management: how to prevent classroom issues and how to respond to problems that arise. Identifies a measurable goal for K–12 teachers: helping students to develop self-control and responsibility. Addresses “teacher burnout” through practical application of stress management. Describes bullying behaviors and teacher response, including a section on working with parents, a vital skill for avoiding and resolving serious problems. Presents realistic case studies and “What Would You Do?” scenarios to demonstrate chapter concepts.
