This volume presents numerical methods to solve soil physics problems using computers. It starts with the theory and then shows how to use Python code to solve the problems. Most soil physics books focus on deriving rather than solving the differential equations for mass and energy transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The focus of this book is on solutions. Agricultural and biological scientists usually have a good working knowledge of algebra and calculus, but not of differential equations. Here numerical procedures are used to solve differential equations.
A lighthearted introduction to the Python programming language, full of fun examples and color illustrations. It begins with the basics of how to install Python and write simple commands then in bite-sized chapters explains essential programming concepts. Ages 8+.

Python algorithms : mastering basic algorithms in the Python language
Python for kids / by Brendan Scott
Problem solving with algorithms and data structures using Python
"Open source and easy to use, Python offers the availability of exciting libraries of software, application programming interfaces, and even connections to web services. This textbook uses Python as a working environment to teach the basics of computing for students with no prior programming experience. Unlike similar texts, it organizes topics based on a functional first approach to teaching programming. The book includes case studies of practical problems as well as homework and interactive tools online, such as flashcards"--

"Welcome to the world of PyQGIS, the blending of QGIS and Python to extend and enhance your open source GIS toolbox. With PyQGIS you can write scripts and plugins to implement new features and perform automated tasks. This book will guide you in getting started with PyQGIS. After a brief introduction to Python, you'll learn how to understand the QGIS Application Programmer Interface (API), write scripts, and build a plugin. This book is designed to allow you to work through the examples as you go along. At the end of each chapter you will find a set of exercises you can do to enhance your learning experience. The PyQGIS Programmer's Guide is compatible with the version 2.0 API released with QGIS 2.0. Both source code and data to accompany the book are available online."--Amazon.com
