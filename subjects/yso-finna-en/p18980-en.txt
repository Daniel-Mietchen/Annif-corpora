Protein kinases as therapeutic targets in leukaemia
Comparative leukemia research : proceedings of an international Wenner-Gren symposium held in Stockholm, September 1965
Neoplastic Diseases of the Blood integrates the history, epidemiology, pathology, pathophysiology, and therapeutics of modern neoplastic hematopathology. The book is divided into five major sections, with the first four covering the spectrum of hematologic neoplasia-- Chronic Leukemias and Related Disorders, Acute Leukemias, Myeloma and Related Disorders, and Lymphomas. The fifth section covers a variety of topics in supportive care. Now in its fifth edition, this classic and invaluable text brings together a team of internationally renowned experts and offers in-depth coverage of the complex interface between diagnosis and therapy. Chapters feature an accessible and easy-to-read layout and provide updates on the tremendous progress made in the last decade in the understanding of the nature of hematologic malignancies and their treatment. An authoritative and indispensable resource for students, trainees, and clinicians, this fifth edition is sure to distinguish itself as the definitive reference on this topic.
