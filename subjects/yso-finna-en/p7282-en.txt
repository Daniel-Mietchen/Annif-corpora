Despite the development of assisted reproduction technologies and significant advances in reproductive biology and medicine over the years the cause of infertility remains unexplained in 10–20% of cases. The cause of infertility in these cases may be connected to problems in fertilization or implantation and genetic factors may play a part in this.The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte and early-stage embryos. It is important for folliculogenesis, fertilization and implantation. In humans, it is composed of four known ZP glycoproteins that all show varying degrees of structural and functional roles in reproduction. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zona pellucida genes in cases of total fertilization failure and zona anomalies, and to study their expression in human fetal and adult ovaries.A total of 34 sequence variations were detected in genes expressing the four human ZP proteins (ZP1–ZP4) among women with fertilization failure and those with varying degrees of zona anomalies in their oocytes. Most of the variations were known single nucleotide polymorphisms, while three were novel findings. Women with fertilization failure had a higher mean number of sequence variations in ZP1 and ZP3 when compared with controls. Some of the most frequent zona anomalies may be at least partly explained by sequence variations in ZP1–ZP4 genes.In fetal life, the expression of ZP3 protein and mRNA could already be detected as early as at the 11th week of gestation and it peaked at the 20th week, the time of primordial follicle formation. This suggests that components needed for zona matrix are already present well before the formation of the zona pellucida and may have a role in the development of primordial follicles. Expression of the transcription factor FIGLA (factor in the germline alpha) was increased at around the 20thweek of gestation, supporting previous findings of its critical role in the initiation of folliculogenesis and primordial follicle formation.The present study adds to our knowledge on the currently still incomplete picture of formation of the ZP and fertilization in humans. Understanding the genetic background of infertile patients may help us to develop new tools not only to evaluate but also to improve their fertilization potential, and to choose the optimal treatment to achieve pregnancy.
