This thesis is a research on personnel security at reception work in Helsinki S-hotels. The focus is on physical and mental violence. The main aim of the thesis is to collect up-to-date information on the frequency of physical and mental violence incidents in the reception work in Helsinki.  In addition, the aim is to examine how well the management is aware of the reception level experiences and thoughts concerning security issues. The meaning for this thesis is to assist S-hotels in creation of safer work environment by giving information on personnel experiences and thoughts around security issues.  The theoretical part of the thesis is designed to give the reader current information on the issues related to security of personnel in reception work. The empirical part of the thesis is based on a questionnaire given to all receptionists of five S-hotels included in the study: Hotel Helsinki, Hotel Vaakuna, Hotel Klaus Kurki, Hotel Torni and Hotel Pasila. For added perspective, the management representatives of the five hotels filled the same questionnaire based on their belief on how the average receptionist in the hotel would answer. In addition, a small-scale interview was arranged with the hotel managers of the five hotels concerning the security related issues.

Social workers have roles that require them to engage with clients and families who may be reluctant clients , ambivalent or resistant towards those seeking to help and protect. This includes safeguarding roles in relation to children and vulnerable adults, and work to engage with marginalised groups such as young offenders and those with mental health and substance misuse problems. The text addresses issues in relation to the main client groups, and specific chapters take an overview of issues such as understanding and defusing aggressive behavior and keeping yourself safe from assault.

In this volume, the authors present an overview of the innovative work taking place in relation to domestic violence and child protection. This book looks at new prevention initiatives and how interventions for children exposed to domestic violence have been developed. It shows how services for abusive fathers have evolved and provides discussion and critique of a number of new initiatives in the field of interagency risk assessment. With international perspectives and examples drawn from social care, health care and voluntary sectors, this book brings together established ideas with recent thinking to provide an authoritative summary of current domestic violence and child protection practice. As a valuable source of guidance on how to work safely with children living with domestic violence, this is a key reference for social workers, health professionals and policy makers.
