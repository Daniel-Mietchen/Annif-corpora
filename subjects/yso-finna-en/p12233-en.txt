Charging of electric vehicles is becoming more and more common. Charging of electric vehicles does not only need a functioning infrastructure but also various information systems to handle data in the process. The purpose of this thesis was to study how a completely new information system for handling energy information collected in the process of charging electric cars could be built by using existing energy sector information systems. The research problem for this thesis was provided by Empower IM Oy. The research for this thesis was mainly done by studying the OCPP protocol and design documents of Empower IM’s information systems. Some of the information was collected by interviewing specialists and by participating in meetings and presentations. The end result of this thesis is a data model for ESSP, a study of the OCPP protocol and use cases how the OCPP is used in ESSP functions. The data model describes how the objects of electric vehicle charging are modelled using the EnerIM CIS database.
