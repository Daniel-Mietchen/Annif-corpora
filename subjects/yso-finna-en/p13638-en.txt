We chose this topic because of our interest in golf and tourism. This thesis is a balanced combination of them both. This thesis gives new ideas for developing golf tourism in Eastern Uusimaa. Our work is based on qualitative case study. The research problem was how to develop Eastern Uusimaa golf tourism and create co-operation between golf-related clubs, accommodation and other services. Several professionals from the golf clubs and accommodation service business owners were interviewed. The interviews were made by email and phohe in 2007 and 2008. The research started by looking at the Eastern Uusimaa as a whole and after that the problems were divided in pieces. The results were different depending on the point of view. The golf clubs focused on different problems than the accommodation services or golf professionals. The main problems were the lack of co-operation between the different golf clubs and the region of Eastern Uusimaa, cash flow and the belief that no problems existed. In the end, the thesis introduces different suggestions for improving golf tourism in Eastern Uusimaa, such as golf multipass, golf and hotel packages, golf tournaments, green fee discounts and exchange days between the golf clubs.
