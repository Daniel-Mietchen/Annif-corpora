As a result, a table of steel plant’s analyzers was produced in the thesis. The table will be documented and attached to the analyzers maintenance works, in order for maintenance and investment services to utilize it. Critical review of analyzers reveals for example the use of the analyzer, criticality, spare equipment and spare parts situation. Investment of new peak gas analyzer system is a clear justification, as set out in the thesis. As a means of improving condition monitoring introduces filling of calibration certificates in calibration context. At the same time improves the analyzers maintenance manuals in Arttu system. In addition, e-mail transmission of blast furnaces analyzer alarms was introduced in the thesis. Action is proposed that instead of concentrating analyzers maintenance to workshop, improves the plant's internal networking.

Aim of this thesis was to investigate the Ruukki Raahe steel plant’s installed base of continuously operated process analyzers, make a critical analysis and identify opportunities to improve condition monitoring. In addition, there was a need to regard operation and investment of the peak gas analyzer, as well as find out whether the maintenance of analyzers transfer to responsibility of centralized maintenance makes sense. The thesis was commissioned by electrical department of Ruukki workshop. The analyzers installed base and relevant information was sorted out by interviewing specialists and equipment suppliers and searching information on Arttu and Alma systems. The criticality of analyzers was defined as in case failure and operation by interviewing different professionals at the plant. Opportunities to improve condition monitoring were clarified as it stands and in the future. Opportunities and challenges of analyzers maintenance concentration was surveyed at the maintenance point of view.
