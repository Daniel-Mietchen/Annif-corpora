Global contemporary and the rise of new art worlds
Whitney Biennial 2006 : day for night
This reader is the result of Joanna Warsza's course at the Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in 2015. It examines four recent cases of boycotts, presenting their political, ideological, and economic contexts, timelines, statements, as well as interviews with parties involved. It reflects on how certain biennials became the place where the power of art is renegotiated and why one simply “can't work like this.”

Whitney Biennial 2014
The Whitney Biennial', the Museum's signature exhibition, has charted some of the most exciting new work in contemporary art since it was first introduced in 1932. Three guest curators - Stuart Comer, Anthony Elms, and Michelle Grabner - offer diverse views of contemporary art today. 'Whitney Biennial 2014' serves as a record of this historic exhibition, featuring the work of almost 100 artists working in a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, film, dance, and performance. Divided into three distinct sections presenting each curator's unique perspective, this superb resource features specially commissioned texts alongside curatorial essays and unique visual content prepared by the Biennial participants.
