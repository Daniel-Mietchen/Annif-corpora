This thesis is the result of a failed project in which its author was tasked to create a Single Sign-On access controller for Conmio Ltd, the orderer of the thesis. The goal was to provide a custom-built solution for Conmio that would fit the company's internal needs in a way which other general purpose systems couldn't.    The even initially ambitious goal was further on expanded after a questionnaire was performed to collect the company's internal requirements and more importantly by the lacking definition of limits for the system's core component, Role Base Access Control based access controller which both together caused the scope of the project to go way beyond the desirable scope for a single-man project. As a result, the project failed after being delayed in total for over a year.    The analysis of this thesis focuses on the reasons which caused the actual project to fail. As a conclusion a better way of approaching a similar piece of work is suggested.

This Bachelor's Thesis evaluates open source job scheduling frameworks for the Java programming language. The evaluation is based on selected business- and technical requirements which are used as the evaluation criteria. The evaluation process has three phases and the evaluation process was used with standard project methodology. This thesis contains the first two phases and the third phase is a separate empirical implementation and test of the selected Java job scheduling framework. There is separate documentation for the empirical part containing a technical description and a developer's guide. In the first phase, an initial coarse evaluation of the Java job scheduling frameworks is conducted to find the most suitable frameworks for the second phase evaluation. In the second phase, a more detailed evaluation of the Java job scheduling frameworks is conducted for those frameworks selected in the first phase. Based on the evaluation results of the different Java job scheduling frameworks an empirical test application is implemented, separately from this evaluation, with the job scheduling framework which best meets the evaluation criteria. The separate documents include an installation guide and a technical description.

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to design Kanban system and create implementation plan for a laundry business case Ravanin Pesula Oy. Washing process was targeted for designing since it plays an important role in controlling inventory level at Ravanin. The thesis project was carried out with ambitious of designing a reliable and applicable Kanban system together with manageable implementation plan using various studies about Kanban, author's working experiences as well as supporting from Ravanin in gathering data. The implementation in action would be up to the case company to whether apply it into their washing process using the designed Kanban size and signal, or modified it according to their preferences.  The theory approach was focus on two mains sections including designing Kanban system and creating implementation plan. The idea of Kanban in Lean manufacturing was first provided as well giving the reasons why Kanban would be an ideal option to utilize time for production planning as well as minimise inventory level. The theories for designing Kanban system was described step by step, starting from collecting and conducting data, to sizing the Kanban and finally developing the Kanban design. Meanwhile, how to apply the Kanban into manufacturing environment was added as well which is known as implementation plan consisting training plan, start up the Kanban and dealing with rising problems, and audit the Kanban.  The empirical part was in the same order as the theoretical part meaning that data was collected through face to face interview with Ravanin and then being conducted using theoretical guideline. The Kanban size was calculated based on not only conducted data but also author's working experiences so that it would match company's expectation and working manner. In developing the Kanban design, three different Kanban designs were selected due to its demand and distance between washing process and downstream processes. The last but not least section was to create implementation plan for the designed Kanban. The training plan was provided defining who to train, what to train and how. In addition, the rising problems when first starting the Kanban and its solutions were given as well to increase the benefits of Kanban. For managing and improving Kanban, audit process and approach were explained in the way that support the company in utilizing the Kanban's performance in scheduling production as well as managing inventory level. Keywords: Kanban, inventory management, Lean manufacturing, visual schedule, production planning.
