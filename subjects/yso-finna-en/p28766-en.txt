Innovation in ethnographic film : from innocence to self-consciousness, 1955-85
Comprehensive introduction to the anthropology of the arts, this is the first textbook to go beyond visual art to cover the arts more broadly. Drawing together media such as painting, sound, performance, video, and film, it presents a clear overview of the cross-cultural human experience of art.
Proposes an anthropological theory for interpreting human picture making. This title looks at the relationship between image and death, tracing picture production, including the first use of the mask, to early funerary rituals in which pictures served to represent the missing bodies of the dead.

Made to be seen : perspectives on the history of visual anthropology
Visual anthropology has proven to offer fruitful methods of research and representation to applied projects of social intervention. Through a series of case studies based on applied visual anthropological work in a range of contexts - health and medicine, tourism and heritage, social development, conflict and disaster relief, community filmmaking and empowerment, and industry - this volume examines both the range of contexts in which applied visual anthropology is engages, and the methodological and theoretical issues it raises.

The Handbook of Participatory Video advances the field as the first major work to critically examine the use of participatory video around the world as a tool for research, community activism, and social change. Participatory video is a growing area of research and an increasingly popular tool among practitioners, researchers, and NGOs working with communities around the world. The Handbook of Participatory Video advances the field, engaging critically with it as a research methodology and method and interrogating assumptions about its emancipatory nature and potential for social change. In twenty-eight chapters, contributors examine historical, ethical, methodological, and technical aspects of participatory video and discuss power, ownership, and knowledge production. The Handbook is organized into six parts: Locating Participatory Video, Participatory Video as a Critical Research Methodology, Working with Visual Data, Power and Ethics in Participatory Video, Dissemination and Reaching New Audiences, and Communities and Technologies. This benchmark work takes an interdisciplinary and global approach and will be invaluable to researchers, practitioners, and students.
