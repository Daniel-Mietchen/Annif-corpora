American ingenuity : sportswear 1930s - 1970s
Published as a companion book to the recent Stone Island 30 exhibition held in Florence, Archivio is a magnificent pictorial history of the brand's first 30 years. Billed as 'A Photographed Edit of the Stone Island Archive', the book is a superb collection of pieces drawn from the Archive covering fabric composition -- effectively a giant historical 'Look Book'. Stone Island, designed by Italian designer Massimo Osti in 1982 and currently led by Carlo Rivetti, is known for innovative sportwear with performance fabrics and high technology. 307 photographs of models from the eighties to the present day include sweatshirts, sweaters, trousers and jackets.
