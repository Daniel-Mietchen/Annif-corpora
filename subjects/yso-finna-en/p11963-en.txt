The natural characteristics of the Moldavian Plateau land and the human intervention lead to soil degradation on the slopes damaging seriously the environmental quality. In order to contribute to maintain soil losses at acceptable levels it was monitored surface runoff and soil erosion under cultivation conditions of the dominant plants in the area. The experiments carried out at the Podu-Iloaiei Agricultural Research and Development Station, during 1965-2006, aimed to study of water runoffs and soil losses by erosion in different crops; the annual rate of soil losses under anti- erosion protection of different crops; the influence of water runoffs and soil erosion on soil organic matter and nutrient losses. For this purpose an appropriate experimentation was established in a side with an average slope of 11%, including plots (25 m x 4 m) for runoff control, isolated from the rest of the area by metallic walls and equipped downstream with installations for collecting water and soil samples. The measurements were carried out on the whole area of the catchments, where the experiments were conducted since 1980, arranged by strip cropping and contour buffer strip. The experiments were supported by the appropriate instrumentation of a hydrological station providing rain gauge, triangular waste weir, limnigraph and devices for water and soil samplings. The results showed that mean annual soil losses by erosion during 1980-2006 were 0.14 t/ha in perennial grasses on the second growth year, 2.01 t/ha in beans, 2.57 t/ha in maize and 3.06 t/ha in sunflower. The highest losses were registered in maize continuous culture (335 kg/ha humus, 17.43 kg/ha nitrogen, 1.06 kg/ha mobile phosphorus and 2.36 kg/ha mobile potassium); these amounts decreased very much at the same time with the increase in rotation structure of crops (pea, wheat, alfalfa and perennial grasses) protecting soil against erosion. At three and four year rotations, which included good and very good cover plants for protecting soil against erosion, the amount of eroded soil and nutritive elements lost by erosion were very close to the limit allowable for this area.

Climate change scenarios predict that seawater temperature and precipitation will increase in the Baltic Sea region during the next century. In the northern part of the Baltic Sea, increasing inflows of the terrestrial allochthonous dissolved organic matter (ADOM) are expected to be a major consequence of elevated rainfall, which can alter light and nutrient availability for phytoplankton. The aim of my thesis was to elucidate effects of ADOM on phytoplankton production, community, size-structure and nutritional strategy along offshore south-north gradients in the Baltic Sea, as well as in estuarine systems exposed to seasonal variation in river discharge. Field studies, a mesocosm experiment and a modeling study were used to explore these issues.Results from the field studies and mesocosm experiment illustrated that the nutritional strategy, size-structure and cellular pigment content of the phytoplankton were governed by changes in ADOM, and thus in light and nutrient availability. A summer study along an offshore south-north gradient showed that the proportion of mixotrophic phytoplankton increased towards the north. In this area the concentrations humic substances (proxy for ADOM) were high, while the light availability and phosphorus concentrations were relatively low. The phytoplankton cells responded to reduced light availability by increasing their chlorophyll a: carbon ratio. Additionally, the levels of photoprotective pigments decreased from south to north, as a result of acclimation to a low-light environment and reduced exposure to ultraviolet radiation. According to ecological assumptions picophytoplankton should be favored in light- and nutrient-limited environments.However, the results did not follow that pattern, the proportion of picophytoplankton being highest in the relatively nutrient rich Baltic Proper. The study was performed during the decline of an extensive bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria, a successional phase in which picophytoplankton often dominate the phytoplankton community. The estuarine studies performed in the Bothnian Bay (Råne estuary) and in the Bothnian Sea (Öre estuary) showed different successions. In the Råne estuary no spring phytoplankton bloom occurred and highest primary production was observed during the summer. This absence of a spring bloom was explained by low phosphorus and high ADOM concentrations, while the summer maximum could be explained by higher temperature and nutrient concentrations. In the Öre estuary a marked phytoplankton spring bloom was observed as well as an ADOM sustained bacterial production phase.The later secondary peak of bacterial production observed in summer, concomitant with an extended secondary primary production peak, suggests that autochthonous dissolved organic matter supported the bacterial growth Furthermore, the photosynthetic efficiency (i.e. phytoplankton growth rates) was lower during spring, indicating that high ADOM, and thus lower light and phosphorus availability, disfavored phytoplankton growth. Our modeling study showed that climate change can impact the food web; however effects will be different between basins. In the southern Baltic Sea elevated temperature and nutrient discharge may promote nutrient recycling and oxygen consumption, potentially extending anoxic areas, sediment nutrient release and cyanobacteria blooms. In the north, increased inflow of ADOM may promote heterotrophic bacterial production and decrease primary production due to light attenuation and lower phosphorus availability.This will favor the heterotrophic microbial food web and consequently lead to lower food web efficiency of the ecosystem.

The paper presents the soil formation processes that take place in the gangue heaps resulted from iron mining ore at Capus quarry, Cluj County, Romania. The gangue which resulted was transported and piled up into heaps, without uncovering and a selective separation of the layers, such a low-fertility material resulted. This heap was partially levelled and used in plantation of pine (Pinus sylvestris), perennial gramineae (Lolium perenne, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense), locust (Robinia pseudacacia) and spruce fir (Picea abies). After 25 years of recultivating, profiles were opened under the pine and gramineae plantations and physical and chemical analyses were carried out and compared to those of the initial heap. An evolution of the main pedogenetical indices (pH, humus, total nitrogen and mobile phosphorus and potassium) was observed in both of the studied profiles. The results show that after 25 years of planting the gangue heap with the two cultures, some layers of soil were formed, which, in a certain extent, have characteristics of the pedogenetic horizons, the evolution of the entianthrosoils towards a certain soil type being evident. The soil towards which these entianthrosoils evolve is of the Regosoil type.
