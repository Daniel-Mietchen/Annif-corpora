Structural reforms will boost long-term economic prosperity in the euro area. In the short term, reforms could weaken economic performance. Nevertheless, on the whole, both an empirical and a theoretical examination of structural policy in the euro area strongly suggest there is an urgent need for structural reforms. These provide the only way to boost the potential output of the economy in a situation in which the long-term prospects for many euro area economies and the outlook for general government sustainability look bleak..

How the economy works : confidence, crashes and self-fulfilling prophecies
This highly unique book takes a fundamental look at when and how a government can fail at its core responsibility of formulating rules. Government, representing society, relates to the economy by formulating the rules within which (market) players should operate. Although market and business failure are much discussed in the economics literature, government failure is often overlooked. This book addresses this gap, exploring in detail what constitutes government failure. Wilfred Dolfsma illustrates that it is not adequate to discuss government failure simply with reference to its level of expenditure, as is usually the case. Defining government failure and analysing it in the domains of health care, innovation and technology, he explores topics such as how market and society relate, consequences of conflicts between government policies, how government should (not) intervene, the vulnerability of institutions and rules (set out by government), and suggests a welfare perspective for evaluative purposes. This stimulating and thought provoking book will prove a fascinating read for academics, researchers and advanced students in economics - particularly public choice and institutional economics - public administration, policy studies, and law and economics.

Abstract: USA's market crashes of 1929 and 2008 : comparison of events preceding the history's greatest crashes. The objective of this research was to find out what were the differences between the events preceding market crashes of 1929 and 2008. The findings would serve the purpose of reminding everyone how these situations have developed until the impending crash and crisis. This should prove to be valuable help in the future when people are facing the same conditions again. The research's approach was a general historical view on the matter. Descriptive research methods were used to gather and analyze the data. Various sources from literature, articles, speeches, research papers and statistics databases were being used to compile the data. The research consists of macroeconomic theories, bubble theories, research data and conclusions. The results of the research were almost as expected. Not much had changed in 80 years in the financial sector's ability to not get drawn into self-caused crises. These events before the history's greatest crashes were different in their nature but contained all the same elements. Good future prospects combined with extraordinary profits because of financial innovation equalled an economic bubble. Many other aspects were the same also, such as lack of regulation. This means that more work should be done on the process of inflating bubbles in order to find ways to avoid the possible catastrophes caused by the bursting bubble. Professor Galbraith's words “As a protection against financial illusion or insanity, memory is far better than law.” held high importance in the research. It should be everyone's obligation to ponder and try to understand these financial aspects as they can cause great abundance, or great distress depending on what have been learned from the history. This research paper can be taken as a small step towards that goal and as a reminder of past.

There was fear that the global economic crisis would interrupt the flow of remittances to developing countries, force migrants to return to their sending households and endanger the economic health of sending nations. However, anxiety over the collapse of remittances was largely unfounded. While there was a small decline in remittance flows globally in 2009, in general, they did not fall as far or as quickly as other forms of assistance and they have begun to recover. In this paper we examine a series of myths that colour the remittance debate. Debunking the myths that surround remittances allows us to show the complex role remittances play for migrants, their sending households and communities as developing nations cope with the global economic crisis..

Social policy and the Eurocrisis : quo vadis social Europe
Abstract: World Factory in Crisis : Global Economy Downturn as a Speedbump on the Path of Development in China's Pearl River Delta, and the Twisty Road for Recovery. As one of the world's largest and most dynamic economies, as well as an important member of international matters, China attracts enormous attention and the focus is on the opportunities and challenges associated with China's emergence. The Pearl River Delta Special Economic Zone of Guangdong province in the southeast China, is the pioneer of the Chinese Economic Reform initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, and has been the most dynamic economic region since then. During the ongoing reform process, this region has become a manufacturing center of global importance, the province with the highest GDP, and one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world. Being the leader of China's economic reform and global manufacturing centre, the region is suffering from a sharp decline in export demand, large-scale of small and medium companies shutting-down and lay-offs of migrant workers. The traditional industry mode based on cheap labour and low value-added manufacturing is facing much limitation due to rising cost of land and labour. An industrial upgrading and restructuring is the solution. To cope with the problems caused by the crisis and to transform traditional industries into high value-added and high-tech industries, local governments have implemented a series of policies to support the region's industrial upgrading. Some relevant and valuable lessons can be learnt from Taiwan's industrial upgrading. With the once-in-a-decade political change in China in November 2012, how will the new national political body affect the Pearl River Delta's revolutionary road?
Managing international financial instability : national tamers versus global tigers
The Asian financial crisis has engulfed most of the region's countries, with the notable exception of China, which has maintained a stable dollar exchange rate.However, China's situation is being widely discussed, some commentators claim that China will eventually be forced to devalue while others maintain that China neither needs to nor would gain from a devaluation. China, not yet a fully open economy, has the means and resources to withstand pressures against its currency.Reserves remain comfortable and the trade surplus is even growing as China's exports to the United States and Europe continue to grow at a healthy pace although exports to other Asian countries have slumped.Domestic economic activity is recovering from a slowdown as public expenditure is rising.However, rapid reform of China's state-owned industries and bad-debt ridden state-owned commercial banks may be endangered if foreign direct investment fails to pick up the slack in the labour market as stateowned industries and government ministries shed millions of workers.Chinese authorities might be tempted to ease the pressure through a devaluation of the renminbi.However, China's exports have an import content of 50 percent, so a small devaluation would make little difference, and a large devaluation would probably trigger a new round of competitive devaluations among the region's countries, in the end leaving everyone worse off than before.For the time being China is therefore best served by maintaining a stable exchange rate, but in the longer term China may have to reconsider the wisdom of its peg to the US dollar. Keywords: China, Asian crisis, devaluation, exports, trade surplus, exchange reserves, renminbi, reform .
European populism in the shadow of the great recession
Deep recessions have typically led to a permanent step down to a lower growth trajectory. However, since the financial crisis of 2008, the growth rate itself has also been exceptionally slow, due to weak growth in total factor productivity. In addition to the recession itself, the slow pace of recovery does, in fact, constitute a significant part of the overall costs of the crisis..

Whatever happened to Social Europe? The promise of Jacques Delors seems to have spawned a flurry of European Union directives, yet has since fizzled out. This edited volume, bringing together a team of international interdisciplinary experts from across Europe, systematically explores the EU's social policy activities, both before and after the Eurocrisis. The contributors examine how and why the great expectations remained unfulfilled, but also move the scholarly debate beyond the emphasis on courts and markets. European Commission policy entrepreneurship, eastern enlargement, the shifting ideological contours of European Social Democracy, and the spirit of the Lisbon Agenda have all led to market creation taking strong precedence over market correcting policies. This insightful and comprehensive volume will be of great interest to European Union scholars and practitioners alike.
