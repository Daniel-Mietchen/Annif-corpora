Abstract: Personal and general publishing policies of geographers.
This book examines the problems, pitfalls and opportunities of different models of assessing research quality, drawing on studies from around the world. Aimed at academics, education officials and public servants, key features include an overview of the argument of whether research should be assessed and how should research quality be determined. The book offers a survey of research assessment models in the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand and includes an examination of citation analysis, and comparison between the different models.
