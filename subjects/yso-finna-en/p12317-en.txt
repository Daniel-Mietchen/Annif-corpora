A basic guide to starting and successfully practicing small-scale rainbow trout farming, summarizing all essential technical information important for small-scale trout production. It includes general information on efficient treatment of trout farm effluents, taking into consideration the need to protect mountainous regions where water resources could support profitable trout farming. The aim is to guide the reader through the necessary technical information, related practical solutions and the steps of preparation of both investment in and day-to-day operation of a small-scale rainbow trout farm. It includes a glossary and illustrations for easy understanding.
