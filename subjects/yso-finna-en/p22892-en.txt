"Membrane technologies play an increasingly important role in unit operations for resource recovery, pollution prevention, and energy production, as well as environmental monitoring and quality control. They are also key component technologies of fuel cells and bioseparation applications. Membrane Technologies and Applications provides essential data and background information on various dimensions of membrane technologies, with a major focus on their practical application. Membranes of inorganic materials offer cost-effective solutions for simple to complex separation problems. This book is designed for anyone interested in water and wastewater treatment, membrane suppliers, as well as students and academics studying the field. "

"Fascial Release for Structural Balance" combines manual therapy skills with the exciting new field of structural therapy, which employs the unique and newly discovered properties of fascial tissues. Fascia, our biological fabric, plays a vital role in support, posture, and stability. Through informed assessment and manipulation of fascial patterns, you can help eradicate many of your clients' chronic strain patterns-for good. The book is designed for any bodywork practitioner using manual therapy. Physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, and massage therapists can help their current and future clients by giving them a structural analysis and creating a treatment strategy using the techniques included in this book. The authors bring together a unique introduction to fascially informed structural anatomy with a method for postural analysis and detailed and easily applied techniques.
Micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration for the removal of heavy metals from phosphorous-rich wastewaters:from end-of-pipe to clean technology
As membrane technology becomes increasingly common in filtration processes, its problems have begun to emerge. The problems have long been solved by technical advances, module construction and process design. This thesis project was conducted at Genencor International Oy, Hanko plant, Finland with the assistance of the Cedar Rapids plant in Iowa, United States. The aim of this thesis was to optimize the cleaning-in-place (CIP) of a microfiltration unit. Genencor has been a part of DuPont since 2011. CIP has been a problem with the microfiltration unit at the Hanko plant, cleaning has not been efficient and the cleaning costs have risen. Fouling decreases the lifetime of the membranes, which have to be changed more often. The optimization was performed at pilot scale. Data was collected by testing to see how detergents would influence the cleaning. Enzymatic, caustic, acidic, surfactant and disinfection cleaning agents were used. The efficiency of cleaning was measured by clean water flux (CWF) and by monitoring the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and retentate pump output. The best cleaning agents were Cleaning Agent A, Cleaning Agent B, and Cleaning Agent C and the best cleaning cycle was cleaning cycle 2. The Cleaning Agent A cleaned the surface of the membrane as the Cleaning Agent B and Cleaning Agent C cleaned the pores of the membrane. There is much more to test to conclusively optimize the CIP. More tests should be conducted on the optimization of the cleaning cycles. Ways other than chemical cleaning, such as prevention of fouling, should be studied and the optimization of the filtration process is an important part of CIP optimization.

"This book will cover the development and utilization of polymer films and coatings derived from non-petroleum, renewable resources from an applications perspective rather than being designed in the form of chapters in which individual polymers or polymer types are described. It will also include the topic of sustainability and how it is defined as well as a chapter on new developments in film production or coating technology in relation to existing technology (e.g., nanocomposites, plasma or corona treatment technology and lamination)"--
