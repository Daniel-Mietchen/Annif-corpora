Knit is an exciting and dynamic design area, with new technologies opening up a wealth of creative possibilities for designers, as well as innovative uses of traditional techniques. Witty, hyper-real and luxurious designs are being used by fashion designers, while artists, activists, and community groups are reinterpreting the medium to stunning and surprising effect. This showcase of the best knitted textiles around the world is divided into three key areas: fashion, art, and community. In fashion, the book features beautiful and innovative constructions from designers such as Mark Fast, Christian Wijnants, and Sibling. The art chapter includes Annette Streyl's knitted architectural sculptures and Isobel Berglund's floating installations. Examples of experimental public work from guerrilla knitting collectives, such as B-Arbeiten's yarnbombing, is represented in the community section.

Treasures of everyday art
Tate Modern's Turbine Hall has played host to some of the world's most striking and memorable works of contemporary art. Now, this vast space welcomes the largest work ever created by renowned American sculptor Richard Tuttle (born 1941). Entitled 'I Don't Know . The Weave of Textile Language', this newly commissioned sculpture combines vast sways of fabrics designed by the artist from both man-made and natural fibres in three bold and brilliant colours. The commission is part of a wider survey of the artist taking place in London this autumn and comprising a major exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery surveying five decades of Tuttle's career and a sumptuous new publication rooted in the artist's own collection of historic and contemporary textiles.--Tate website.
