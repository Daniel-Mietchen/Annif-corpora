Various disturbances and ecological successional processes shape the structure of forests and affect biodiversity. We examined the forests over a 7400 km2 area in the Upper Min River watershed in Sichuan under different levels of human disturbance. This mountainous watershed represents a transitional landscape between the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and the Sichuan basin, with elevations ranging from 900 m to 5700 m. The watershed is degraded due to deforestation and soil degradation caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. According to different levels of human impact, the sample sites were divided into four classes: 1) near-natural forests, 2) selectively logged forests, 3) natural regeneration forests (after clear-cut), and 4) plantations. At different elevations, following quantitative characteristics were analysed: stand volume, basal area, weighted diameter, weighted height, and 7 biodiversity indices of tree species. The results showed that the structure of forest stands was characterized by a large number of seedlings and saplings. The near-natural forest had a significantly higher stand volume and basal area than the other managed stands. The four levels of human impact resulted in different abundance, evenness and richness of tree species along the altitudinal gradient. Explanatory variables, such as volume and weighted diameter, significantly contributed to the models for discrimination of stands under different human impacts. The result implies that near-natural forests, with their large stand volumes and biodiversity, can be used as references when developing strategies for forest restoration.

This study examines the impact of selected environmental variables on the position of the limit of continuous forest (actual timberline) on three fells situated in central Finnish Lapland, namely Aakenustunturi, Yllästunturi and Pyhätunturi. The factors studied are elevation, topography and snow load damage to coniferous trees. The potential for ascending timberlines in the region is discussed. The limit of continuous forest in the study area is hardly ever composed of a single species but rather features alternating occurrences of spruce, pine and mountain birch. The average altitudinal position of the actual timberline is highest on the southern and western slopes (366-428 m a.s.l.), while the lowest altitudes are recorded on the northern and eastern slopes (336-403 m a.s.l.). Prevalence of block fields and slope gradient are the most significant and visible factors controlling the position of the actual timberline. On the studied fells, from 10% to more than 50% of the total length of the actual timberline is controlled by block fields. The lowest occurrence of the limit of continuous forest, at 270 m a.s.l., results from an extremely high proportion of block fields and steep slopes. Snow patches and delayed snow melting also hamper the upward advancement of the forest. Continuous forest reaches its highest altitudes at 440 m a.s.l. on slopes with gentle inclination and land cover other than block fields, and 460 m a.s.l. in sheltered furrows. Average snow load damage to spruce and pine at the actual timberline varies in the ranges 15-58% and 30-76%, respectively. Snow load damages on trees undoubtedly impede the advance of the actual timberline to higher elevation in all exposures. Seedling density (number/ha) on south-facing slopes near the actual timberline is ca. 5 times greater than on the north-facing slopes. Recent regeneration and seedling establishment is almost absent at the treeline near the fell tops. Results suggest that there is potential for actual timberline advance on south-facing slopes with gentle inclination and missing block fields. It is uncertain, however, whether natural regeneration will take place on felltops with few or no trees.
Forested wetlands throughout the world are valuable habitats; especially in relatively species-poor northern regions, they can be considered biological hotspots. Unfortunately, these areas have been degraded and destroyed. In recent years, however, the biological importance of wetlands has been increasingly recognized, resulting in the desire to restore disturbed habitats or create in place of destroyed ones. Restoration work is taking place across the globe in a diversity of wetland types, and research must be conducted to determine successful techniques. As a result, two studies of the effects of wetland restoration and creation were conducted in forested wetlands in northern Michigan and southern Finland. In North America, northern white-cedar wetlands have been declining in area, despite attempts to regenerate them. Improved methods for successfully establishing northern white-cedar are needed; as a result, the target of the first study was to determine if creating microtopography could be beneficial for white-cedar recruitment and growth. In northern Europe, spruce swamp forests have become a threatened ecosystem due to extensive drainage for forestry. As part of the restoration of these habitats, i.e. rewetting through ditch blocking, Sphagnum mosses are considered to be a critical element to re-establish, and an in-depth analysis of how Sphagnum is responding to restoration in spruce swamp forests has not been previously done. As a result, the aim of the second study was to investigate the ecophysiological functioning of Sphagnum and feather mosses across a gradient of pristine, drained, and restored boreal spruce swamp forests.

Two-year cycle spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [Kirby]) adults were collected from emergence traps installed on two types of hosts (stumps and windfalls) in two adjacent timber harvesting areas in central British Columbia over a 5-year period to determine the incidence of associated fungi, bacteria, yeasts, nematodes, and mites. There was no difference in either the mean size or the female ratio of spruce beetles between host types or areas. Yeasts and bacteria were the most common associates of the spruce beetle and were isolated from the majority of beetles, regardless of host type. Pesotum sp. A, a blue-stain fungus, was the most common filamentous species and was isolated from 63% of the 221 beetles sampled. This fungus appears to be closely associated with the spruce beetle regardless of host type. At least 25 taxa of other filamentous fungi (OFF) were also isolated from beetles. Most of the OFF were common, wind-dispersed species, prevalent in the environment, e.g., Penicillium and Cladosporium spp., and are likely only incidental associates of the spruce beetle. The OFF were more likely to be isolated from beetles emerging from windfalls than from stumps. This may have been due to higher moisture in windfalls, which promoted the growth of some OFF. The incidence of mites and nematodes associated with the spruce beetle was relatively low; however, only those observed on the exoskeleton were recorded. The association of microorganisms with the spruce beetle did not vary between the two timber harvesting areas sampled in this study. Despite differences in the two types of host material, the spruce beetle is able to maintain a consistent association with yeasts, bacteria, and Pesotum sp. A.

This study quantified above-ground biomass affected by selective logging in the tropical rainforest of South East Cameroon and also investigated the suitability of the density of logging roads, the density of log yards as well as variables from MODIS 250 m data (Red, NIR, MIR, NDVI, EVI) in explaining above-ground biomass logged. Above-ground biomass logged was quantified using allometric equations. The surface area of logging roads and log yards were quantified and used in the determination of above-ground biomass affected by these infrastructures based on a national reference baseline value for the forest zone of Cameroon. A comparative analysis revealed that 50% of potentially exploitable commercial tree species were effectively harvested with a harvesting intensity of 0.78 trees ha-1 representing an average above-ground biomass of 3.51 Mg ha-1. The results also indicated that 5.65 Mg ha-1 of above-ground biomass was affected by logging infrastructure .i.e. 62% as compared to 38% of above-ground biomass that was logged. Correlation and regression analysis showed that the density of the logging roads explained 66% of the variation in above-ground biomass logged and 73% of the variation in above-ground biomass logged was explained by the density of the logging roads and NDVI from MODIS data. The density of log yards and the variables from MODIS data were generally weak in explaining the variation in above-ground biomass logged.

Domestic cattle grazing as a disturbance factor to the vegetation structure is investigated. It is concluded that the process of heterospecific attraction plays as important a role as vegetation structure in predicting waterfowl assemblage patterns. The study site, an estuarine wetland in an urban zone in .Helsinki, is studied during one staging period. Two sets of shorelines are focused on, grazed and ungrazed. Avian assemblages are compared in both types of shorelines based on variables of community structure and habitat resource use. The two most influential variables are aquatic invertebrate biomass index as food supply, and bare shoreline proportion as habitat structure indicator. The process of competition as regulating factor in forming avian aggregations is ruled out by confirming that sufficient amounts of habitat resources, food and space are available. The co-occurrence patterns of foraging guilds are analyzed. Heterogeneous vegetation structure, combined with social attraction, influences avian distribution patterns. Niche partitioning is absent across the whole landscape as invertebrate food resource is not a limiting factor. Microhabitat use within plots is evenly distributed. The constantly popular microhabitats are sections of the grazed shorelines where resource partitioning is absent. Avian habitat preferences are shaped by extent of available bare shoreline and the presence of other waterfowl. The latter effect is confirmed both as conspecific and heterospecific attraction. It is the first time this wetland, which is also a designated Natura 2000 and Ramsar site, is being investigated for wildlife community dynamics. The site does not suffer from major environmental threats and has potential for more waterfowl consumers. In view of its international significance, this and similar research can aid urban planners in Reserve management to enhance avian diversity towards attracting species of more conservation concern.
