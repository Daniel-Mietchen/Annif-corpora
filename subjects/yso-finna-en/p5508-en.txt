This well-documented collection challenges the reader to examine and judge the arguments in six areas of contemporary unrest: women's liberation, black liberation, gay liberation, children's liberation, animal liberation and liberation in the Third World. It refrains from taking a single point of view, thus allowing the reader to gain an insight into the various aspects of the debate. Designed both for students and a general audience, The Liberation Debate encourages readers to become active participants in fraught and topical debates.

Declared dead in the 1990s, liberation theology is very much alive and well today across the globe. This book brings together prominent voices from the global North and South to present brief analyses of liberation theology's future. It includes leaders in the field along with the newest voices. Each of these pieces was presented in the American Academy of Religion in the first five years of the Liberation Theologies Consultation. This book aims to reach a wider audience of undergraduates and graduates in religious studies and theology to provoke discussion of the future of liberation theology. As the consultation itself stated, the two themes of this book are: cross-over dialogue - between contexts and between disciplines; and reflection on the implications of liberationist discourse for the transformation of theology itself.
