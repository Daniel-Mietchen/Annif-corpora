Lung Cancer and Autoimmune Disorders
Angiotensin converting enzyme and sarcoidosis
Noncommunicable Diseases
Lung cancer and autoimmune diseases are complex entities in that they involve gene disturbance, gene polymorphism, and impaired gene repair mechanisms. The volume focuses on altered gene expression in tumor processes and in chronic autoimmune disorders. The chapters discuss the biological rationale for novel disease protein markers, present relevant clinical results, and give some diagnostic and therapeutic tips.

Rheumatic rarities
Rheumatic features of sarcoidosis
Diseases of the respiratory system often cause multisystem dysfunction and morbidity. Respiratory diseases not transmissible by a direct contact are rarer than those of inflammatory or infectious background. Such noncommunicable diseases, often entailing genetic and immune aspects, are areas of limited understanding; sarcoidosis being a case in point. This book tackles the issues relevant to such diseases. The research on novel cytokine markers, which may help in the diagnosis and management of sarcoidosis, is described. Modern approaches to the management of pneumothorax, a frequent accompaniment of lung diseases or chest wall trauma are dealt with as well. There are also chapters that underscore the immuno-inflammatory mechanisms of disorders seemingly unrelated to respiration, such as obesity or aplastic anemia, which may appreciably affect the control of the respiratory system and thus its vulnerability to diseases. The book will be of interest to clinicians and medical researchers.
