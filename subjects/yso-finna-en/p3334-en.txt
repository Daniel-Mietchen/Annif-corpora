In over 40 years as a senior captain for Greenpeace International, Peter Willcox has been in the vanguard of the international environmentalist movement. He has led crews into battle for the good of the planet against whale killers, nuclear testing sites and deep sea drillers. The recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Guardian, Peter has confronted naval warships, including diving in front of a moving destroyer; faced a bombing attack of the iconic 'Rainbow Warrior', resulting in the murder of a shipmate; and endured imprisonment for peacefully protesting Russian oil drilling in Antarctica along with his crew. This is his story.

The purpose of this study was to compile a detail account of working environment for Russian social associations. This is important since the working environment in Russia is different when compared for example to Finland or the United States.For this qualitative research six interviews were conducted. Three interviews were conducted in Russia and three in Finland. Interviewees were association managers, country managers or researchers of this field. The basis for this research was an index developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This index consists of seven points: Legal environment, Public image, Financial viability, Organization capacity, Advocacy, Service provision, Infrastructure.Russian social associations are under lot of pressure. In a complicated legal environment with weak financial situation and poor public image. Still, many Russian associations are able do very important work.
How to be a green liberal : nature, value and liberal philosophy
Organized across national boundaries and with millions of supporters worldwide, transnational environmental activist groups such as Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, and Friends of the Earth play a central role in the way the world addresses environmental issues. This book provides the most systematic and theoretically informed study to date of the strategies these organizations use to advance global environmental protection. Based on case studies of three transnational groups, it argues that in addition to lobbying governments, activists operate within and across societies to effect widespread change. They work through transnational social, economic, and cultural networks to alter corporate practices, educate vast numbers of people, pressure multilateral development banks, and shift standards of good conduct. Wapner argues that because this activity takes place outside the formal arena of inter-state politics, environmental activists practice "world civic politics" they politicize global civil society. The theoretical import of this book is to bring the practice of world civic politics into sharp relief and generalize its significance beyond environmental affairs to explain the efforts of all NGOs in world politics.
