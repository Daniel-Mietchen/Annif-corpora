Bioethanol is a biofuel that can be produced from microalgae by fermenting the sugars extracted from the microalgae biomass. Spirulina maxima is a cyanobacteria specie that can be forced to accumulate high concentrations of carbohydrates under stress conditions. The sugars can be extracted from Spirulina maxima efficiently by hydrolysis processes. In this research enzymatic and acid pretreatments were combined with thermal hydrolysis to extract sugars and transform polysaccharides to monosaccharides. The sugar mainly present in Spirulina maxima is glucose. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an yeast that is able to ferment the glucose extracted from microalgae to bioethanol. Spirulina maxima accumulated the carbohydrate concentration 62.4% and biomass concentration 1.72 g/L after 9 days of cultivation under phosphorus stress, the productivity of glucose was 0.6 g glucose/d. When both phosphorus and nitrogen were limited from cultivation medium the glucose productivity 0.42 g glucose/d was achieved. In hydrolysis experiment RG 97% was obtained by pretreatment with sulphuric acid. The concentration of H2SO4 was 2% V/V, the time of hydrolysis in autoclave was 45 min at temperature 121 degrees Celsius and biomass load 3 % W/W. The overall ethanol yield was 0.19 g EtOH/g biomass. Enzymatic hydrolysis was also detected to be a possible method to hydrolyse Spirulina maxima biomass to bioethanol. Hydrolysis with amylases achieved RG 87 % and the hydrolysate was fermented with an overall yield of 0.18 g EtOH/g biomass.
