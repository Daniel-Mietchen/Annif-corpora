There are contrasting views on how gender equality affects fertility in contemporary European societies. This article discusses the Russian situation by asking how tensions in the contemporary gender system relate to reproductive decision-making and identity. How do gendered practices and identities influence womens intentions to have children? In depth interview data gathered during the last decade is used to analyze how the two main gender contracts of the professional women and the working mother relate to family planning, child birth, pregnancies, and mothering. Results indicate that while Russian women experience increasing pressure of the double burden and few signs of increasing gender equality in domestic life, the stable identity of Russian mothering contributes to the birth of at least one child. Childbearing does not depend directly on gender roles and division of labor in households. The decision to have a child and care for small children continues to be womens responsibility even as fertility patterns have modernized and gender equality in couple relations is slightly increasing. However, the type of gender contract influences the process of negotiation concerning reproductive matters and the timing of childbirth. .

The past trends in tertiary education attainment of selected post-communist countries are investigated through population projections. Did a common higher education policy manifest itself through attainment levels, and how did the situation change after the collapse of the Soviet regime? The approach is based on comprehensive back-projections ranging from year 2000 to 1970. Descriptive findings for most countries show that the level of tertiary education attainment for women has surpassed that of men sooner than in Western Europe. Results are discussed in light of individual countries' pre-war higher education models and former communist policy, and possible implications are derived for future study of higher education attainment.

"Acquire the diverse skill set required to negotiate and execute a successful sale Buying, Selling, and Valuing Financial Practices + Website shows you how to sell what you've built, or buy what someone else has built, with a win-win outcome. Buyer and seller do not hold disparate goals; selling for maximum value and optimum tax rate&mdash;and buying for minimum risk and complete write-off&mdash;are part of the same strategy that must be the ultimate goal for the good of the industry. Unfortunately, financial advisors tend to make the same two critical mistakes. Exit planning is not succession planning, and every sale or acquisition is different. This book shows you how to complete a sale or acquisition with the best possible terms for both buyer and seller, through deliberate consideration of the size, structure, and sophistication of the opportunity. The companion website provides tools, worksheets, and checklists to aid immediate implementation, and the expert insight will prove invaluable regardless of which side of the table you're on. Buying or selling the result of a lifetime's work requires years of experience to master. This book gives you the benefit of high-level expertise in the multiple disciplines that contribute to a successful sale or acquisition, to provide the perspective and skills you need to work through the deal. Learn why exit planning is different from succession planning Sell what you've built for maximum profit and minimal tax Become someone else's exit strategy for the best possible terms Avoid the common and critical mistakes in the M&A space A successful exit strategy requires the expertise of a CPA, JD, CVA, ASA, MCBA, and a CFA. You must either bring these people to the table, or acquire these skills yourself. Buying, Selling, and Valuing Financial Practices + Website gives you the essential knowledge and helpful tools you need to execute an optimal deal"--

"What is art worth? How can a work by Pablo Picasso be sold for more than $100,000,000? This book explains the market for art--and art's value for all of us. In straightforward prose that doesn't mystify art or deny its special allure, prominent art dealer and market expert Michael Findlay offers a close up and personal view of almost a half century in the business of art. He engagingly explains art's three kinds of value: commercial; social; and what he terms its essential value--the range of responses to art that we as individuals have depending on our culture, education, and life experience. Few avid collectors are immune to the thrill of rising market value, but Findlay argues that buying for investment alone is seldom smart. A genuine love of art and the ways it may enrich one's social life also play important roles. Down-to-earth and with a touch of dry wit, he explains exactly how artworks are valued and reveals the workings of the art market. Enhancing his narrative are wise advice, insider anecdotes, and tales of scoundrels and scams, celebrity collectors, and remarkable discoveries.
