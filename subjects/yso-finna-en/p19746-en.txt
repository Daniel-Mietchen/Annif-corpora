The city of Helsinki was founded in 1550 at the mouth of the River Vantaanjoki on the Gulf of Finland. There is a clearly distinguishable overgrown river bed located to the west of the present channel which would seem far too large for the minor stream flowing through it nowadays. The aim here was to determine whether this stream and its valley do in fact represent an ancient channel of the larger river, for how long this channel functioned and how and when it ceased to do so. The problem was approached by means of morphological surveys, corings, stratigraphic analyses and radiocarbon datings.It may be concluded from the shoreline displacement data and the topography of the area that the threshold of the ancient channel emerged from beneath the sea around 4500 BP (5100 cal. BP). Subsequently two shallow lakes developed at approximately the same altitude around 4000-3500 BP (4500-3800 cal. BP), later drying up as the thresholds that retained them were eroded away. A channel some 50-70 m broad, 5-8 m deep and 8 km in length was created in the valley of the River. The channel began to fill rapidly with fluvial sediment around 2200 BP (2200 cal. BP), however, once the present course of the river was opened up over a low glaciofluvial ridge which had previously restrained its waters in the east. As the new channel gained in depth, the flow in the old one came to an end around 2000 BP (1900 cal. BP), by which time substantial quantities of fluvial sediment had accumulated in it.

"Why Study Fluid Mechanics? 1.1 Getting Motivated Flows are beautiful and complex. A swollen creek tumbles over rocks and through crevasses, swirling and foaming. A child plays with sticky tafy, stretching and reshaping the candy as she pulls it and twist it in various ways. Both the water and the tafy are fluids, and their motions are governed by the laws of nature. Our goal is to introduce the reader to the analysis of flows using the laws of physics and the language of mathematics. On mastering this material, the reader becomes able to harness flow to practical ends or to create beauty through fluid design. In this text we delve deeply into the mathematical analysis of flows, but before beginning, it is reasonable to ask if it is necessary to make this significant mathematical effort. After all, we can appreciate a flowing stream without understanding why it behaves as it does. We can also operate machines that rely on fluid behavior - drive a car for exam- 15 behavior? mathematical analysis. ple - without understanding the fluid dynamics of the engine, and we can even repair and maintain engines, piping networks, and other complex systems without having studied the mathematics of flow What is the purpose, then, of learning to mathematically describe fluid The answer to this question is quite practical: knowing the patterns fluids form and why they are formed, and knowing the stresses fluids generate and why they are generated is essential to designing and optimizing modern systems and devices. While the ancients designed wells and irrigation systems without calculations, we can avoid the wastefulness and tediousness of the trial-and-error process by using mathematical models".

"Particle image velocimetry, or PIV, refers to a class of methods used in experimental fluid mechanics to determine instantaneous fields of the vector velocity by measuring the displacements of numerous fine particles that accurately follow the motion of the fluid. Although the concept of measuring particle displacements is simple in essence, the factors that need to be addressed to design and implement PIV systems that achieve reliable, accurate, and fast measurements and to interpret the results are surprisingly numerous. The aim of this book is to analyze and explain them comprehensively"--Provided by publisher.

Reactive transport in soil and groundwater : processes and models
This book lays the foundations of gas- and fluid dynamics. The basic equations are developed from first principles, building on the (assumed) knowledge of Classical Mechanics. This leads to the discussion of the mathematical properties of flows, conservation laws, perturbation analysis, waves and shocks. Most of the discussion centers on ideal (frictionless) fluids and gases. Viscous flows are discussed when considering flows around obstacles and shocks. Many of the examples used to illustrate various processes come from astrophysics and geophysical phenomena.--

"Both hydrologists and meteorologists need to speak a common scientific language, and this has given rise to the new scientific discipline of hydrometeorology, which deals with the transfer of water and energy across the land/atmosphere interface.Terrestrial Hydrometeorology is the first graduate-level text with sufficient breadth and depth to be used in hydrology departments to teach relevant aspects of meteorology, and in meteorological departments to teach relevant aspects of hydrology, and to serve as an introductory text to teach the emerging discipline of hydrometeorology.The book will be essential reading for graduate students studying surface water hydrology, meteorology, and hydrometeorology. It can also be used in advanced undergraduate courses, and will be welcomed by academic and professional hydrologists and meteorologists worldwide".
