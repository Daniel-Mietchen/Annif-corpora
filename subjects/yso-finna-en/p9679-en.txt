storm water runoff (water)
Introduction to stormwater : concept, purpose, design
Water supply and pollution control
"The second edition of a bestseller, this book discusses details the latest research on management practices for water and sewer capital facilities with an emphasis on infrastructure. It explores recent advances and highlights the technique asset management, which has received international acceptance and applies across various infrastructure sectors. It covers the components of asset management systems, including computer platforms and software packages, methods for condition assessment and ratings, risk-based decision support systems, decision making protocols, triple bottom line business cases, and new options for repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of buried pipe assets"--Provided by publisher.

The objective of this study was to find alternative solutions to the problems of stormwater runoff, which has increased in recent years as a result of urbanization and climate change, as well as to develop new stormwater management methods for the new residential area of Rauhalinna located in a cold climate country. Stormwater is rainwater and melting snow which is not absorbed into the ground, but runs off and flows on hard surfaces such as roofs, parking lots, paved streets, and roads. Stormwater has harmful impacts on our cities, receiving water bodies and groundwater. Thus, the objectives of stormwater management are to mitigate stormwater runoff quantity and minimize flood risk, protect the receiving water bodies and groundwater, and reduce the load on the wastewater plant which causes high treatment cost, as well as to emphasize the development of a sustainable environment. The stormwater management in Finland faces two kinds of challenges. Firstly there is lack of information about rainwater and melting snow, and secondly the experiences of using new and integrated stormwater management systems in the cold and snowy climate of Finland are few and the stormwater legislations are quite young. In this study the dialectical and interrelated relationships between the hydrologic cycle, climate change and urbanization are discussed. Factors that should be considered when planning stormwater management systems such as land use and environmental conditions, municipal responsibilities and recommendations, and the features of the catchment area are dealt with. All new stormwater management systems promote and mimic the natural drainage system. In this thesis some of the new stormwater management methods and techniques which have come up to the use currently, especially in cold and snowy climate are highlighted. The municipality of Kaarina was provided with a comprehensive management system, which encompasses the underground storage system (cassette filed), rain gardens, green swales, pervious pavements and stone channels, in addition to the rain tanks.

Artful Rainwater Design has three main parts: first, the book outlines five amenity-focused goals that might be highlighted in a project: education, recreation, safety, public relations, and aesthetic appeal. Next, it focuses on techniques for ecologically sustainable stormwater management that complement the amenity goals. Finally, it features diverse case studies that show how designers around the country are implementing principles of artful rainwater design.
