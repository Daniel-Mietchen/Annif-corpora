The Persians : an introduction
The Greek and Persian Wars, 499-386 BC
"Herodotus and the Persian Empire" comprises contributions of an international conference held in Innsbruck in November 2008, which was attended by renowned scholars from Europe, America and Australia. The volume is published within a larger context of research. Its preoccupation is centred on a scholarly discussion of the Greek historiography, focussing on the Historical World of Ancient Middle East. The newly established series "Classica et Orientalia" offers a stage of publication to such studies like "Ktesias' World" (CLeO 1), "The Achaemenid Court" (CLeO 2) and "Herodotus and the Persian Empire" (CLeO 3). In the current volume, 33 contributors discuss Herodotus' Histories under various points of view, in essays written in English as well as German. On the basis of Ancient Near Eastern source material, the texts are analyzed within literary studies.
