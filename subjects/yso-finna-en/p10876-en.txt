Summary.
Age and origin of two common MLH1 mutations predisposing to hereditary colon cancer
Basement membranes (BM) underlie epithelia and endothelia and surround many tissues. In cutaneous BM epithelial cells are attached to the stroma via multiprotein complexes called hemidesmosomes (HD). Collagen XVII and integrin α6β4 are components of HD and they bind to laminin 332, a component of anchoring filaments, extracellularly. The main interest of this study is the function of collagen XVII and its interactions with these proteins. What is known about the function of collagen XVII is mostly derived from its role as an adhesive component in cutaneous HD. Here we demonstrate for the first time that collagen XVII is expressed by podocytes in the human and murine glomerulus and that mutant mice lacking collagen XVII in addition to small size, blisters and diffuse hair loss, also have deficient glomerular development and a high mortality rate. We also show for the first time at the protein level that collagen XVII is expressed, and probably has a functional interaction with laminin 332, in normal colon epithelia. We demonstrate that collagen XVII is expressed by the invasive cells of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) samples and its immunostaining is increased in metastasis in CRC. The higher proportion of collagen XVII positive tumor cells correlates with decreased disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival times and we also suggest a functional interaction between collagen XVII and laminin 332 in CRC. Previous studies have suggested that collagen XVII participates in keratinocyte migration by affecting the correlation of HD disassembly and assembly, its expression is increased in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and it may have a role in cell adhesion and migration in SCC carcinogenesis. Here we demonstrate upregulated collagen XVII, integrin β4 and laminin γ2 expression in actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease and SCC. The expression of collagen XVII was increasedwith a high degree of variation, especially in samples taken from areas where SCC is particularly invasive. We also demonstrate in the SCC-25 cell line that lack of collagen XVII or integrin β4 severely disrupts the adhesion, migration and invasivity of these cells. Taken together, in this study we show that collagen XVII is needed for normal glomerular development, is expressed in normal colon epithelia and participates in CRC and SCC carcinogenesis together with laminin 332 and integrin β4.
