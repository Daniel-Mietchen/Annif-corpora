The Sami and the joik
Traditional melodic types in the music of the Sá́mi in Finland
The year 2010 marked the one-hundredth anniversary of the first publication of Johan Turi's Muitalus samiid birra (An Account of the Sami), the first secular book ever published in Sami language. Turi's book is a classic of Sami literature and cultural history. It provides fascinating insights into Sami traditional practices, from reindeer husbandry to hunting and trapping, to childbirth, healing, courtship and song. Turi's Account provides a unique glimpse of turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sami life, and provides fascinating points of comparison with the writings of other indigenous authors from other parts of the world. -- The translation is the work of Thomas A. DuBois. Also included in the present edition are exemplars of Turi's artwork. Together they reveal Turi's claim not only to the title of "first author of the Sami" but also "first multi-media artist" and "first researcher."
