Sporadic E-layer and Magnetic Activity at Sodankylä
Abstract: During extremely strong magnetic storms a sudden anomalous decrease in the F-layer critical frequency foF2 is sometimes noticed above Huancayo (12.0 S, 75.3 W) between 10 and 14 local time The duration of the phenomenon is from some tens of minutes to some hours. During the study period July 1958 - June 1960, seven phenomena were noted...

Abstract: The development of an auroral absorption substorm has been studied using riometer measurements in the northern hemisphere. In the events studied, the onset is preceded by an absorption bay which begins to develop 1 to 1.5 hours before the onset...

Forty below : traditional life in the Arctic
Abstract: The breakup of an auroral absorption substorm is discussed using riometer data on the northern hemisphere. In the longitudinal sector where the substorm breaks up a sharp onset is preceded by a weak absorption which intensifies as it moves equatoward. The intensification factor of a weak equatoward moving absorption is considered.
