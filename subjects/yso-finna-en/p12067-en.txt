Having designed more than 75 K-12 school projects, and with a long-standing commitment to sustainability and a passion for architecture, Alan Ford is perfectly positioned to present this illuminating collection of sustainable school projects from around the world." "Designing the Sustainable School is a compendium of ideas illustrating how some very talented architects and committed facility planners are meeting the challenge of creating better schools for the 21st century. They are creating schools that are eco-friendly, embody high-performance design principles, are rich in architectural character, and enhance the health and well-being of students and teachers. The projects represent a wide range of design solutions, aesthetics, location, and scale, ranging in size from the Aga Khan Award-winning three-room schoolhouse in Burkina Faso by Diebedo Francis Kere, to the 2500-student, 260,000-square-foot high school in Santa Ana, California by LPA Architects." "Each of the 45 featured projects is presented with an overview of the components of the high-performance "tool kit" employed by architects to achieve sustainable design goals. Collectively, these demonstrate the breadth of tools that today's architects can employ to build a sustainable future for our children.

Learning from schools' focuses on the work of the practice given their award-winning school building programme, which includes St Mary Magdalene Academy, Chelsea Academy, Isaac Newton Academy and Northampton Academy, amongst many others. 'Learning from schools' is organised in three sections: Pedagogy, Technology and Architecture . Each of these sections provides a way into Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios work across a wide variety of school buildings. 'Learning from schools' touches on how concerns such as acoustics, circulation spaces and the use of different materials have been deployed in the practice s architecture so as to improve student performance and wellbeing. 'Learning from schools' will be followed by a further publication which focuses on the work of the practice that concerns buildings for cultural activities in a wider sense.
