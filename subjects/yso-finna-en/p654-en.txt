Conclusion (s. 211-214).
Electronic commerce is a constantly growing business form in the world. At the same time, the income of middle class in developing countries is increasing, which booms the world s tourism and a demand for traditional and online travel agencies can be perceived.  The objective of this thesis is to find the current shortcomings or limitations in eCommerce in consumer retailing, with a focus on online travel agencies operating in Finland. There exist several researches relating to the eCommerce barriers in the travel services field, but not any from the Finnish perspective.  The main research problem is: What are the barriers to eCommerce of online travel agencies (OTAs) operating in Finland?  The research method used in this desktop study is qualitative, a multiple-case study of four online travel agencies: E-ticket, Supersaver, Travellink and Travelstart. The secondary data was collected from several various research reports, research journals, statistics offices data bases, articles, companies websites, study reports and international trade websites.  The results of the research are that in Finland, disintermediation in the value chain of travel services is limiting the online travel agencies sales, the major part of airline ticket sales is direct selling at 86 %, consumers prefer to shop in person, they have no need to buy through the Internet and they have payment security concerns. When examining the case companies websites, there were several deficiencies: lack of contact information, false information, broken and false hyperlinks, customer service poorly available, blogs needed, payment methods to be improved, information to be presented in richer ways and missing customer member pages. The lack of quality in the website of an online travel agency is a concern as it is the only contact in many cases the consumer has with the company.

Iran is one of the richest countries in the Middle East, due to its people and natural resources. Lately Iran has been in the media spotlight and created lot of controversy through out the world concerning Iran's alleged possession of nuclear power and its usage. The United States has resisted Iran's actions in fear that the real attempt is to manufacture nuclear weapons and it has forced economical sanctions to Iran in hope of stopping its actions. This thesis is a qualitative case study on trade obstacles in Iran, and it is done in co-operation with PerkinElmer/Wallac Oy. The theory part examines issues that biotechnical companies need to consider and analyse before starting an exporting process to Iran. It clarifies the meaning of export and introduces requirements and readiness of a company or a product to be able to export. It deals mainly with exporting of a product to Iran's markets. In this part, the meaning of commercial and political obstacles in international trade is presented. Furthermore, the theoretical part deals with the market situation in Iran from the perspective of a biotechnical company. In this context, the present state of Iran's health care system is examined and the economical and political atmosphere is introduced as well. The empirical research discusses whether there is demand for PerkinElmer's products in Iran. The research presents possible advantages and disadvantages of working closely with Iran. The political and commercial obstacles that biotechnical companies might face while penetrating Iran's markets are examined. Furthermore, the research indicates what kind of process of entering Iran would be in general. The empirical research was conducted through interviewing representatives of PerkinElmer. The results from the study indicate that several sanctions and regulations have been imposed to Iran. A business transaction with Iran has been made almost impossible. Iran is one of the countries in the U.S. embargoed list. Iran is a very bureaucratic country and only recently it has opened its markets to foreign companies. Iranian health care has improved a lot in recent years, but the country is falling behind in technical improvements. Iran needs foreign investments to update its system. For biotechnical companies, there exits business opportunities in Iran, they are just waiting to be discovered.
