Disability and Information Technology examines the extent to which regulatory frameworks for information and communication technologies (ICTs) safeguard the rights of persons with disabilities as citizenship rights. It adopts a comparative approach focused on four case studies: Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. It focuses on the tension between social and economic values in the regulation of ICTs and calls for a regulatory approach based on a framework of principles that reflects citizenship values. The analysis identifies challenges encountered in the jurisdictions examined and points toward the rights-based approach advanced by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a benchmark in protecting the rights of persons with disabilities to have equal access to information. The research draws on a wealth of resources, including legislation, cases, interviews, consultation documents and responses from organisations representing persons with disabilities.

Abstract: This study explores the conditions of good work in IT consultancy business. The objectives of the study are to find the attributes that employees consider important for good work in an IT consultancy business, and to examine the present conditions in the case company for the good work as well as how the likelihood for good work could be improved.    The concept of good work is used as a framework for this study and supported by the model for engagement and the factors affecting it. The model is built on the theory of motivation and the experience of flow as seen from the individual's perspective as well as the theory of positive deviance and transformational leadership, as seen from the organization's socio cultural point of view. In the literature review, quite many topics studied were found to be overlapping and linked to different theories. As a result, the attributes from the theoretical framework were grouped under six headings of empowerment, meaningfulness, relatedness, communication, rewards & recognition and leadership.    This research is a qualitative type of research with the data coming from two main sources. The first source is the survey questionnaire based on the literature review, which was responded by 64 people representing the population both from the product development and IT consulting employees in the case company. The second source is the interview and open discussion with eight employees in the case company.    In order to answer the research question, the results were compiled from the question-naires and interviews and analyzed against the theoretical framework to understand what people see as the characteristics for each of six headings and to what extent the conditions for good work are met in case organization. Additionally the implications were discussed and recommendations were prepared for the management and employees that could enhance the opportunities for doing the good work in the case company meeting the standards for excellence and ethics and at the same time leading to a feeling of well being in employees. The recommendations are subsequently validated in the case organization by the reference group formed by the researcher.

The ultimate guide to assessing and exploiting the customer value and revenue potential of the Cloud A new business model is sweeping the world--the Cloud. And, as with any new technology, there is a great deal of fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding cloud computing. Cloudonomics radically upends the conventional wisdom, clearly explains the underlying principles and illustrates through understandable examples how Cloud computing can create compelling value--whether you are a customer, a provider, a strategist, or an investor. Cloudonomics covers everything you need to consider for the delivery of business solutions, opportunities, and customer satisfaction through the Cloud, so you can understand it--and put it to work for your business. Cloudonomics also delivers insight into when to avoid the cloud, and why. * Quantifies how customers, users, and cloud providers can collaborate to create win-wins * Reveals how to use the Laws of Cloudonomics to define strategy and guide implementation * Explains the probable evolution of cloud businesses and ecosystems * Demolishes the conventional wisdom on cloud usage, IT spend, community clouds, and the enterprise-provider cloud balance Whether you're ready for it or not, Cloud computing is here to stay. Cloudonomics provides deep insights into the business value of the Cloud for executives, practitioners, and strategists in virtually any industry--not just technology executives but also those in the marketing, operations, economics, venture capital, and financial fields.

Description:  The end of the last millennium was marked by rapid technological advances and deep changes in many aspects of human activity, often taken together as indicative of a shift into a 'knowledge era'. Such changes have stimulated much discussion about the role and processes of education, and about the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in teaching and learning in this new era. Many policy documents relating to these themes have been published by international and regional organizations such as the European Commission, the European Round table of Industrialists, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNESCO and the World Bank. Numerous blueprints on education reform and on ICT in education have also been set out by various governments since the mid-1990s.These policy initiatives brought with them a variety of strategic implementation priorities that differ from country to country, depending on the socio-economic and political context. Such educational strategies may involve, amongst others, changes in curriculum and/or assessment at the system level, provision for ICT infrastructure, teacher professional development, and/or technical and pedagogical support for teachers.Given the deep technological, economic and policy changes that have taken place over the last decade, are there indications that pedagogical practices are changing as well? What impact is the pedagogical use of ICT making in schools around the world? What is the impact of the implementation of these policies on pedagogy and ICT use in classrooms? These are the questions that this book addresses through an analysis of the findings from SITES 2006, an international comparative study of pedagogy and ICT use conducted under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).

The purpose of this paper is to present the different practices SMEs follow to adopt green IT. The main aim was to create awareness, provide current information technology solutions for the green cause, and things to consider when they plan to adopt green IT. SMEs can have pressures to address environmental issues by taking sustainable business practices from social, government and economic factors. SMEs need to have awareness to address this drivers and benefit from the opportunities green IT creates. One of the potential benefits of this study is that it approaches green IT as a holistic manner. In the theoretical background taking green IT framework, sets to figure the different components green IT address. Thus, it depicts green IT is not all about sustainability of IT department and its technologies but it also helps to achieve overall green initiatives, create new opportunities and makes the business competitive while simultaneously getting positive perception towards the business. Green IT is a developing sector and SMEs perception towards it differs from region to region. This paper provides the approaches SMEs need to acquire. A few of the approaches provide technological solutions to obtain energy efficiency, some require perception change within the business, others bring opportunities to business can embrace. Thus, SMEs can grasp from this paper, different green IT solutions when they aim to adopt sustainable business.

The real-time online visualization framework used by the Beam and Radiation Monitoring group at the Compact Muon Solenoid at Large Hadron Collider, CERN. The purpose of the visualization framework is to provide  real-time diagnostic of beam conditions, which defines the set of the requirements  to be met by the framework. Those requirements include data quality  assurance, vital safety issues, low latency, data caching, etc. The real-time visualization framework is written in the Java programming language and  based on JDataViewer–a plotting package developed at CERN. At the current time the framework is run by the Beam and Radiation Monitoring, Pixel, Tracker groups, Run Field Manager and others. It contributed  to real-time data analysis during 2009-2010 runs as a stable monitoring  tool. The displays reflect the beam conditions in a real-time with the low latency level, thus it is the first place at the CMS detector where the  beam collisions are observed.

"Digital disruption continues to cause great confusion for companies of all sizes. For every Kodak-like implosion there's an Uber-like winner-takes-all success. The pace, direction, and impact of digital change has become more sudden, severe, and harder to predict. Think of the car industry and the advent of the self-driving vehicle. Or how the digital cigarette has transformed an industry that may no longer call itself tobacco. These types of disruptions change the game for industries from healthcare to sports equipment. There's no cookie-cutter strategy to get companies through the multi-dimensional nature of the digital beast. Even the sharpest leaders can become disoriented as change builds on change, leaving almost nothing certain. To stand still is to fail. Enterprises and leaders must re-master themselves to succeed. Leaders must identify the key macro forces, then lead their organizations at three distinct levels: industry, enterprise, and self. By doing this they cannot only survive but clean up. Digital to the Core makes the case that all leaders, and particularly CEOs at the helm, must understand the impact the digital revolution will continue to play in their industries, companies, and leadership style and practices. Drawing on interviews from 40 top C-level executives in some of the world's most powerful companies and government organizations, including GE, Ford, Tory Burch, Babolat, McDonalds, and the US Department of Energy, this book delivers cutting-edge insights from those on the front lines. The authors incorporate Gartner's annual research from top CIOs and CEOs and also apply the deep knowledge and qualitative insights they have acquired as practitioners, management researchers, and advisors over decades in the business. Above all else, Raskino and Waller want companies and their top leaders to understand the full impact of digital technology and integrate it at the core of their businesses. "--
