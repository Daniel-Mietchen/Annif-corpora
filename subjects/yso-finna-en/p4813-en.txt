Among the many states of late medieval Italy, one stands out for its unfamiliarity to an English audience and for its neglect in historical research: that of the Este family, lords (later Dukes) of the cities of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio in northern Italy. This book is the first modern attempt to provide a detailed analysis of the political structure of this state based on archive sources. Much of the book is concerned with the ways by which the Este used their vast landed resources in and around Ferrara to build up and reinforce their personal political authority both within and outside their dominions. Among the major themes examined are the continuing presence of political feudalism in the relations between the Este and their supporters, the place of the court in Ferrarese noble society, and the violent imposition of Este authority over the powerful nobles of the Apennine hills.

Entrepreneurship is a highly desired option for employment nowadays. Many hope to find superior living standard, independence, realization and job security through the entrepreneurial path. In some cases, self-employment is the only option available in order to maintain sustainability. (Eiyebholoria, 2012) However, numerous barriers are encountered on the path to success and entrepreneurship barriers can vary from one place to another. Furthermore, regardless the increase in entrepreneurship among immigrants in the past decades, various authors have acknowledged that barriers to entrepreneurship faced by immigrants attempting to establish and running a business in the country of settlement are greater. Additionally, often these barriers are not clearly known by the policy makers of the host society. For that reason, this research was conducted with the objective to understand and investigate the type of barriers that were encountered by immigrant entrepreneurs in the city of Turku. In this study, the literature review was formed based on a number of reliable academic sources concerning entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship barriers and immigrants. The first part of the literature review consists of a description of entrepreneur and immigrant entrepreneurs. The second part offers a general overview of the entrepreneurship barriers that are often confronted by immigrants. The primary data was collected by using an online survey, which was designed with close-ended and open-ended questions related to entrepreneurship barriers, open-ended questions were intentionally implemented to allow respondents to express themselves freely. The questionnaire was sent to several immigrant entrepreneurs registered in Turku local business support and services agency database.After analyzing the research empirical data collected through the survey, it was confirmed that immigrants encountered quite few barriers to entrepreneurship in the city of Turku. The major barriers were caused by the insufficient connection with the local community formal network. Recommendations based on primary data analysis and several new questions for further research were implemented at the end of this document.

This study was conducted in order to address the challenges Inex Partners Oy has in the lateral communication between Processed Food and Daily Non-Food Products department and Purchasing department. This study argues that the challenges in lateral communication are due to three main issues. These are challenges in general communication such as inadequate relationship forming between the members of the two departments, geographical distance between the two departments and lack of communication guidelines from the management. The challenges are also derived from the way the members of the two departments are forming and are not forming effective cross functional teams. Thirdly the challenges are due to the way knowledge is managed in the organization. The research problem was: Why is the lateral information flow between the two departments not working in Inex Partners Oy? The research problem addressed a situation; a phenomenon at a certain time, and thus the research is cross-sectional and exploratory. The research approach is inductive and the research method is qualitative due to the context related and human aspect of the issue. The interview questions were derived from different related theories and the questions addressed the research problem from various angles. The data provided a lot of relevant and enlightening information regarding the problem and thus the analysis of the data gave valuable answers to the problem.   The findings of this study truly answer the research problem from various aspects and they truly enlighten the problem from a new point of view. As the study does not concentrate purely on communication but it also takes into account the human aspect and the knowledge management aspect of the challenge, this study provides new information to Inex Partners Oy that can help the company to take actions to overcome the challenge.

A goal of the presented thesis work is to discuss a phenomenon of absence of small, private accommodation sector in Helsinki and to evaluate possibilities for its appearance. The key objective is to study whether it is a cultural feature or a practical barrier that prevents for instance families from opening small hotel businesses just as it is commonly practiced in many other countries, and to evaluate prospective of any changes in the local industry.    The work began with studying history of development of hotel business in Helsinki. A set question to answer was: when did the development of small accommodation end if it ever existed? It was followed by studying the present state of affairs. After that, comparison between situation with small accommodation in Helsinki and St. Petersburg was drawn. St. Petersburg was chosen due to its near-to-Helsinki location, and for a contrast to Helsinki situation with the sector of mini hotels.    The given paper is a research-oriented thesis. A qualitative method was preferred to quantitative as the author's goal was to gather industry professionals' opinions rather than just statistical numbers as a result of this study. The research was divided into three sections: interviewing Helsinki industry professionals, reviewing St. Petersburg industry professionals' discussions, interrogating potential travellers. A project work in a form of a business plan had been done beforehand to support meaningfulness of the further research work.    After having evaluated the present situation, an important question to address was: what are global tendencies in accommodation of today? The theoretical findings were supported by opinions of potential travellers of different social and age categories who were asked what type of accommodation they prefer when travelling. The responses helped the author draw a conclusion on whether there is demand for independent mini hotels or not.    Analysis of the findings showed that there is significant difference in accommodation specifics in Helsinki and St. Petersburg. Both cultural features and practical barriers prevent small businesses from developing in Helsinki. Yet shifts in local accommodation supply in near future towards more unique, life-style, budget and more segmented lodging are forecasted.

Our research explored the use of social media among crisis and emergency management organizations and we present the main incentives and barriers experts perceive in social media adoption by such organizations. The data were gathered via an international online questionnaire sent to crisis communication and management experts. The results indicate that crisis and emergency management organizations use social media specifically to disseminate information to citizens but also increasingly to receive it from citizens. They are motivated to use social media because of the possibility for communicating through them directly, rapidly, and widely, as well as for building responsible relationships and situational awareness. Lack of knowledge, time, and role models for implementation, as well as inflexible and old-fashioned organizational culture, were the main barriers mentioned for not utilizing social media. Based on the results, further effort should be put into promoting the dissemination of knowledge, best practices, and experiences of using social media across the various actors and organizations providing crisis response.

Electronic commerce is a constantly growing business form in the world. At the same time, the income of middle class in developing countries is increasing, which booms the world s tourism and a demand for traditional and online travel agencies can be perceived.  The objective of this thesis is to find the current shortcomings or limitations in eCommerce in consumer retailing, with a focus on online travel agencies operating in Finland. There exist several researches relating to the eCommerce barriers in the travel services field, but not any from the Finnish perspective.  The main research problem is: What are the barriers to eCommerce of online travel agencies (OTAs) operating in Finland?  The research method used in this desktop study is qualitative, a multiple-case study of four online travel agencies: E-ticket, Supersaver, Travellink and Travelstart. The secondary data was collected from several various research reports, research journals, statistics offices data bases, articles, companies websites, study reports and international trade websites.  The results of the research are that in Finland, disintermediation in the value chain of travel services is limiting the online travel agencies sales, the major part of airline ticket sales is direct selling at 86 %, consumers prefer to shop in person, they have no need to buy through the Internet and they have payment security concerns. When examining the case companies websites, there were several deficiencies: lack of contact information, false information, broken and false hyperlinks, customer service poorly available, blogs needed, payment methods to be improved, information to be presented in richer ways and missing customer member pages. The lack of quality in the website of an online travel agency is a concern as it is the only contact in many cases the consumer has with the company.
