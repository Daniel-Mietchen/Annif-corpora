Summary: While the FAO recognizes that genetic engineering has the potential to help increase production and productivity in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, it is also mindful of concerns about the potential risks posed by certain aspects of modern biotechnology, including effects on human and animal health and possible environmental consequences. This training package is composed of three parts: Principles of safety assessment of foods derived from recombined-DNA plants, Tools and technique for trainers, and Case Studies. It is also includes a CD-ROM containing the visual aids and other relevant reference material. After the completion of training based in this tool, recipients will be able to plan and deliver GM food safety assessment training for food safety authorities, regulators and scientists as part of their own national training programs.--Publisher's description.

Animal diseases that are known to spread primarily through human activities can be prevented and controlled through the application of biosecurity measures along the production and marketing chain, together with increased awareness and education. With this document, FAO, OIE and the World Bank aim to provide applied biosecurity recommendations to all pork production stakeholders in the numerous pig farming systems worldwide, particularly in developing and transition countries. Pig farmers are the main intended beneficiaries of the paper, but it is also of use to veterinary and technical service providers who are in a position to deliver and implement the proposed measures, to decision-makers in government and to project managers in agricultural development.--Publisher's description.
