The teachers' standards in primary schools : understanding & evidencing effective practice
"Meeting the criteria set out in the Teachers' Standards is essential for all trainee teachers, but translating it into classroom practice isn't always easy. Supported by practical classroom examples, this book helps teacher trainees to develop critically reflective perspectives on their practice and provides guidance on how professionalism can be demonstrated and evidenced in primary classrooms. Key coverage includes: Effective teaching and learning and what it means to be a learner ; Planning and assessment for successful teaching ; Meeting the needs of all children ; Behaviour management ; Professional responsibilities ; The role of subject and pedagogical knowledge. This is essential reading for all students on primary initial teacher education courses including university-based (PGCE, BEd, BA with QTS), and schools-based (School Direct, SCITT) routes into teaching."--Back cover.
