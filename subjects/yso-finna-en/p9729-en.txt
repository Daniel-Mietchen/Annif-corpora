The ability of a business to engage in real organisational learning and to do so faster and in a more sustainable way than its competitors is being increasingly seen as an essential component of success. In Making Sense of Organisational Learning, Cyril Kirwan examines the wide range of factors necessary to create and sustain organisational learning and knowledge at all levels. At the individual level, the generation of continuous learning opportunities and reflection on experiences are critically important. At the team level, it's about encouraging collaboration, team learning and the sharing of knowledge. At the organisational level, the emphasis is on building systems to capture and share knowledge and providing strategic leadership for learning. The book shows you how you can best exploit the knowledge that already exists within your organisation while at the same time develop the capability of the people that work there. It deals in turn with individual learning; learning with others; learning in organisations; and in particular the role of the HR function and of line managers. Each chapter provides theoretical background and real-world examples. Diagnostic questionnaires, checklists and other tools are also included.Making Sense of Organisational Learning provides an evidence-based argument for the adoption of effective organisational learning policies and practices, and offers a real opportunity to improve performance. Thinking practitioners working in and around learning and development or organisation development will find it invaluable, as will those undertaking post-graduate study in HR and related disciplines.
"In times of economics turbulence, an organization's ability to learn from its environment and adopt innovations enhances its competitive advantage as well as its ability to improve its performance. This book focuses specifically on the contribution learning and innovation in management accounting can contribute to the success of the organization. However, all management accounting can contribute to the success of the organization.The success of an innovation is contingent upon whether the learning and implementation process have been properly integrated. When they are not, an innovation that has been successful in one organization may fail in another. An integrative framework is developed for studying management accounting process innovations. The framework draws on theories from organizational sociology. It focuses on the impact of the innovation on the organization along two important dimensions. First, to what degree does the innovation alter the organization's management accounting system (labeled as extent)? Second, what portion of the organization's is affected by the change (labeled as scope)? We classified these dimensions on a continuum ranging from high to low. This yields a 2x2 contingency framework. The book examines each of the resulting four situations using both Argyris's typology of single and double loop learning as well as the variety of theories used to explain the adoption, or failure to adopt a particular innovation, e.g. Rogers, Sandburg, in a organization. Recent management accounting innovations such as activity-based costing (ABC) and balanced scorecard (BSC) are used to illustrate the concepts and examples drawn from organizational practices. ABC and BSC are used as examples of management accounting innovations to illustrate why they are more successful in some organizations but not in others."--Publisher's website.

"Positive Organizational Scholarship" is a book that helps establish a new field of study in the organizational sciences. It examines a variety of positive dynamics in organizations that give rise to extraordinary outcomes, often described by words, such as excellence, thriving, flourishing, abundance, vitality, and resilience. POS has a bias toward life-giving, generative, and ennobling human phenomena. It represents a value perspective based on ideas of "goodness" and positive human potential. POS is distinguished from traditional organizational studies in that it seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition, and it does so in rigorous ways, based on scholarly research and theory. Chapters in this volume will serve as the key reference material for those interested in understanding exceptional, virtuous, life-giving, and flourishing individual and organizational behavior.

Change is now so commonplace that people no longer talk in terms of the "whitewater epoch". Every sector of the economies of the developed world has experienced huge swathes of change in the last decade of the twentieth century alone. Increased global competition, aided and abetted by technological advances, has led many organizations to seek to re-invent themselves in the hope of being able to survive and thrive. In mature sectors in particular, where the pace of consolidation is accelerating, organizations have had little option but to grow through acquisition or be absorbed. Whether the change is labelled "continuous process improvement", "restructuring", "downsizing" or re-engineering", to employees, change usually brings with it added pressures, job insecurity and a consequent loss of commitment to the organization. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success argues that strategic change in the new millennium will be geared increasingly to achieving sustainable high performance, rather than just short-term gains. Most theorists now agree that the real challenge of change lies in gaining employees" willingness to commit to the change effort. Change leaders at every level need to be able to understand the elements at work in any change process, and to use judgement about the style of leadership required to give the change effort the best chance of success. Understanding Change: theory, implementation and success provides an overview of change and organizational theory, leading in particular to the author"s definition of the "input" elements of the high performance organisation, based on extensive research into UK and international organisations. It also contains a section looking at the management of change, with case studies illustrating approaches to managing change which are conducive to achieving sustainable high performance. In her companion book, The High Performance Organization- creating dynamic stability, the author explores some of the "how to"s" of building an organizational culture which is supportive of high performance in today"s challenging environment.

Originally part of Berrett-Koehler Communication's "Collaborating for Change" series, this short introduction to Appreciative Inquiry is the best way for organisations to be introduced to AI by the originators and leaders of the movement itself. Now with a new introduction and updated with revisions throughout, "Appreciative Inquiry" offers an approach that works because it acknowledges the prevailing attitudes toward change. It offers a fresh view based on the possibility of a more desirable future, experience with the whole system and activities that signal "something different is happening this time." That difference systematically taps the potential of human beings to make themselves, their organisations and their communities more adaptive and more effective. This approach is based on solid, proven principles for unleashing people's creativity, knowledge and spirit toward a common purpose.
