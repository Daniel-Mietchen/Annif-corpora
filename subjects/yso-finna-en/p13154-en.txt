The aim of this study was to evaluate an application tool for the Company to see if the application tool would increase the use of the resources, make the selling process more effective and help the project management tasks and phases and decrease the time used for the deal. The whole delivery and sales processes from getting a lead to the final document delivery and into the project closure were examined. Additionally, the Company managers were interested in if the application tool can be used to make it easier for the Company distributors to generate accurate offers for the customers without massive help from the Company sales department. The marketing and sales functions of the Company were analysed and investigated by the researcher as well as the sales actions and functions of the company’s distributors. The methods were analysed and investigated to reveal the possible problems in the partner sales. After the thorough analyses were done, the outcomes were compared against the application tool to see if the application solves the problems. An action research approach was used as the researcher was an insider in the Company. The chosen approach may offer the researcher an easier access to information than an outsider would have. On the other hand, being the insider naturally means that the researcher must put special emphasis on the objectiveness of the study. The solution suggestions are cloud based services that are easy to implement and monitor and which are improving customer service, partner communication, and channel sales. They were chosen for the case Company instead of more traditional solutions as they better fit into the small company.
The objective of this Bachelor’s thesis was to automate performance measurements done in the development of a radio transmitter and a receiver. The main objective was to develop measurement automation routines for five basic performance measurements using National Instruments LabVIEW as a software development environment. In order to meet this objective, a study of radio technology and their architecture was required. Additionally, a study of measurement systems and control was required. The developed software had to be modular to ease further development in future. The thesis was done for OY LM Ericsson AB site in Oulu, which is concentrated on the development of small-cell base station products. Measurement results gained with automation software were compared to those of manual measurements. As a result, main five measurements were successfully automated, and the results obtained matched those of manual measurements in terms of accuracy. Also, multiple smaller measurement automation routines were developed to ease automation development in the future. The thesis work was evaluated successful because of time and resources saved by the automation. In addition, it was possible to use the software modules in different additional measurements, for example in the testing of signal processing algorithms.

Tree-limit and climate evolution at the southern extremity of the Swedish Scandes have been reconstructed for the entire Holocene and for the past century. The main objective was to test the reproducibility of a similar study further north in the Swedish Scandes. The long-term history relies mainly on radiocarbondated megafossil tree remains preserved in peat and mineral soil. The more recent perspective was analysed from age distributions in the most marginal, extant tree populations. Pinus sylvestris (pine) immigrated to the study region already during the Late-Glacial, 10,500 14C yr BP, when it grew in the summit areas of fi rst deglaciated mountains. The pine tree-limit peaked ca. 9200 14C yr BP, followed by a 345 m gradual descent (summer cooling + land uplift) until about a century ago. Presence of tree species assemblages without modern analogs at high elevations during the early-Holocene, Pinus sylvestris (dominant), Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa, Picea abies, Larix sibirica, Quercus robur and Corylus avellana, strengthens the view of a warm and dry summer climate, although with a different seasonal distribution of incoming radiant energy than today. The longterm natural trend of tree-limit retreat and summer cooling was anomalously broken about a century ago. During the 20th century, the pine tree-limit has shifted 140 m uphill, in congruence with instrumentally recorded summer warming by ca. 1 &ordm;C. In a perspective of the entire Holocene tree-limit chronology, the modern tree-limit rise (and climate warming) is anomalous for the past 4000-7000 years. Except for tree-limit rise, recent warming has contributed to changes in the alpine plant cover, e.g. vanishing snow-bed communities, expansion of deciduous dwarf-shrubs, graminoids, and invasion of exotic and thermophilic plant species. Overall, this study has reproduced processes and patterns previously reported further north in the Scandes.

This study followed 14 young volunteers as they broadcast on community radio. It explored how learning occurs and how volunteering may structure this, and whether such learning has distinct characteristics from types of learning theorised in the literature. Methodology is discussed as something that should be evident throughout all aspects of the research, particularly in relation to developing research relationships and its effect on the researcher. Methods used were blogs and group interviews over a 3-month minimum period, designed to encourage participants to collect data, allay attrition and to remove the researcher from part of the data collection process.

Masers are observed at a range of scales - from comets, through star-forming clouds, to galactic nuclei - and have many astrophysical applications, for example measuring cosmological distances. Written for postgraduate students and professional researchers in molecular astrophysics, this volume is an up-to-date survey of the theory and observations of astrophysical maser sources and their use as astronomical tools. The book summarizes the history of the discovery of various maser molecules and lines, and discusses maser observations on various scales. The theory is discussed in detail, including the quantum-mechanical response of the molecules, before being linked to more general radiation transfer. A discussion of spectral-line radio astronomy techniques shows how maser observations can be applied more generally to radio astronomy. The book introduces new and projected instruments, including ALMA and SKA. Additional topics address the radiation statistics of astrophysical masers, and numerical methods of analysis.

This book utilises the author's twenty years of research experience to describe conclusions on the nature of quasars, their distribution, and their evolution in the universe. Concentrating on observational astrophysics rather than theory, Quasar Astronomy serves as both a summary of what is known about quasars and a guide to research methods and unanswered questions. After reviewing the cosmological framework and necessary equations, the book discusses all aspects of observed quasar properties. Techniques are summarised for analysing quasar data obtained with various kinds of telescopes and extensive references are given to recent publications. The major original contributions in chapters 5 and 6 deal with the distribution of quasars in spacetime, a subject extensively discussed in the current research literature. The book not only summarises existing results from various techniques but refers to the potentialities of new instruments that are presently being developed, resulting in a unified, up-to-date and practical account of the astronomy of quasars.
This book is concerned with the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, and the theory of their effect on radio waves. It includes accounts of some mathematical topics now widely used in this study, particularly W. K. B. approximations, Airy integral functions and integration by steepest descents. The subject is divided into ray theory and full wave theory. Ray theory is useful for high frequencies when the ionosphere is treated as a horizonally stratified medium. The discussion of the magnetosphere, whose structure is more complicated, includes an account of whistlers and ion cyclotron whistlers. The book has been planned both for final year undergraduates and as a reference book for research. It is suitable as a course book on radio propagation for students of physics or electrical engineering or mathematics. Some of the topics are presented from an elementary viewpoint so as to help undergraduates new to the subject. The later parts are more advanced. Because the subject is so large and has seen many important recent advances, some topics have had to be treated briefly, but there is a full bibliography with about 600 references.
