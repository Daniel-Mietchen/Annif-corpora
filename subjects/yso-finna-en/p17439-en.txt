Higgaad iyo far barasho = ABC book for children
A delightful introduction to the alphabet, using characters and objects from the iconic Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. A is for Alice, E is for for Egg (Humpty Dumpty of course), Q is for the Queen, not forgetting R for the Rabbit who started off the whole adventure. With charming, traditional colour illustrations by Sir John Tenniel and beautiful Victorian-style decorations and backgrounds, this is a really special book for young children and, together with One White Rabbit - A Counting Book, they form a very classy introduction to the classic Alice.
