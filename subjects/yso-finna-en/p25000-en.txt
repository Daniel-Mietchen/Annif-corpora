Tracking what is happening on a website in realtime is invaluable. The objective of this thesis was to start and launch the first version of Snowfinch, an open source realtime web analytics application. The thesis report contains up-to-date fundamentals of web analytics; reasoning behind the most important and difficult technical decisions in the project; product development methodologies; and an overview of the resulting application. Understanding visitors is the key to a site's success. Research shows that the amount of insights provided by clickstream data is small in comparison to the amount of data gathered. Even though there is much more to web analytics than clickstream data, the fact is that it is the only data that can be collected and analyzed exclusively by software, thus the need to optimize its use. With the current use and importance of social media, being able to act quickly is a business differentiator. Visualizing data in realtime is crucial to a fast response. Choosing an appropriate data store plays an important role in the overall performance, responsiveness, and development time of the system. The development work was sponsored by Kisko Labs Oy. Snowfinch will be used both internally and in client projects. During the development period, it has tracked over half a million page views and approximately two hundred thousand visitors. Snowfinch may be used by anyone as it is, or it can act as a solid foundation on which to build customized functionality. Being free and deployable inside a private network offers a competitive advantage over commercial alternatives. The fundamental technologies used are the Ruby programming language, the Ruby on Rails web framework, and the MongoDB document-oriented database. The project was released under the MIT license, a permissive and free software license approved by the OSI (Open Source Initiative).

The goal of this thesis was to create an online flea market for Data Media Gazelle, a digital agency located in Turku. The purpose of the website was to create an environment where users could place ads for the items they wished to sell. Administrators could control the categorization and the user-generated ads. The website was created with CakePHP, a web application framework. The core elements of the project were ad creation, categorization, navigation and administrator actions. These elements were implemented by using different CakePHP components, helpers, functions and methods. Different web technologies are explained at the start of this thesis. After that some of the different PHP frameworks are introduced briefly and some comparisons are made. The CakePHP framework is examined more thoroughly, including aspects such as model associations and data validation. At the last part of this thesis, the project itself is explored in depth. The database behind the project is explained and different structures of the website will be demonstrated, complete with code examples.
Offers instructions for working with the Groovy programming language and the Grails Web framework, covering such topics as building a user interface, security, Web 2.0, reporting, batch processing, and deploying and upgrading applications.

"Need to move a relational database application to Hadoop? This comprehensive guide introduces you to Apache Hive, Hadoop's data warehouse infrastructure. You'll quickly learn how to use Hive's SQL dialect- Hive QL- to summarize, query, and analyze large datasets stored in Hadoop's distributed filesystem. This example-driven guide shows you how to set up and configure Hive in your environment, provides detailed overview of Hadoop and MapReduce, and demonstrates how Hive works within the Hadoop ecosystem. You'll also find real-world case studies that describe how companies have used Hive to solve unique problems involving petabyes of data."--P. [4] of cover.

Playing for Java : covers Play 2
This Bachelorâ€™s thesis was done as a private project with objectives to propose and describe an idea for a web application. The proposed application enables students in developing countries to prepare better for exams, acting as a collective platform for exam preparation related activities. Another objective of this thesis was to gain practical knowledge of web application development and related technologies by developing a prototype web application for the proposed idea. Ruby and Rails web framework was used to develop the prototype. The reasons to opt Ruby and Rails for development were its open source nature, popularity and my keen interest in learning the framework. Front-end framework Bootstrap 3.0, online drawing tool Google Drawing and other technologies associated with the web application development were used to describe the idea and to build the prototype application. Question paper browsing, reading, subscribing and answering components were fully developed in the prototype application along with very basic social networking features such as, posting micro-post and following other users. Being a prototype, the developed web application has potential for further development. Features, such as web accessibility, responsive design, social network integration, push notification service, and PDF file generation can be added to extend the application.
