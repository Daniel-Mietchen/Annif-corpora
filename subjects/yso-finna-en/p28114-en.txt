Startupland : how three guys risked everything to turn an idea into a global business
"Every day, innovative entrepreneurs pioneer bold economic ideas that change the way we live and work. Companies like Google, Apple, Oracle, Facebook and Twitter aren't the only ones shaping our economic future--there's another trend emerging that will change the ways we work and live. The "sharing economy," or the "collaborative consumption economy," includes companies like TaskRabbit, Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, Zaarly, and DocVacay who are purveyors of an economic system that revolves around sharing human and physical resources. This new aspect to the economy, Steven Hill argues, is a dead end for U.S. workers, as well as for the national economy.In Raw Deal, Hill shows the "sharing economy" is a new and troubling component to what is an overall bad economy that undermines workers. Vulnerable freelancers and day laborers hire themselves out for ever smaller jobs and amounts of money, and it is only the companies who hire them who reap the big benefits. Hill argues that we must shift the support for American workers to one that is individual-based rather than workplace-based. Countering the onset of the freelance society and the new economy is the new civil rights and labor struggles of our time. This important book answers these questions and provides pragmatic solutions to adapt our economic system to its new realities, launching a new civil rights struggle capable of transforming the freelance society into a stakeholder society"--

This book explores startups that have thrived against the odds in places where startup success was deemed to be unlikely. Discussing a number of technology startups from around the world that have succeeded without state backing nor local venture and seed capital, Black Swan Start Ups provides unique insights into unsung models of success beyond the two dominant narratives of Asia's 'Tiger Economies' and America's Silicon Valley miracle. The author describes these stories of success as 'black swan events' and ascribes their achievements to the ability of entrepreneurs to leverage the 'place surplus' of their locations, while building connections to support networks outside their immediate geographies. Including case studies such as Skype in Estonia, SoundCloud in Germany and Bayt.Com in Dubai, this insightful book gives a holistic and wide-ranging view of how technology startups have, and can, succeed in less likely places. .
The thesis is provided to help small startup-companies to learn basic factors of international customer service. It does not have any specific commissioner but a company of any field of business is welcome to take advantage of it. The objective of the thesis was to make an international customer service guide with the most general perspective as possible and to include the most important matters according to international customer service into the same guide. Source materials are used as references and these materials were the basis of the research. Books (i.e. Järvinen, R; Rosti, P; Ylikoski, T; 2002. Hyvä asiakaspalvelu-menestystekijä finanssialalla) and articles (e.g. Business and industry portal; Service and selling strategies at the time of sale) had a major role in the results of a research of this kind. The main findings of the thesis are that a functional customer service is a necessary part of any kind of business, qualitative customer service requires expertise and that cultural factors have an impact on international customer service. This thesis can be continued by another author in the future. The next step for it would be to consider a specific culture and a startup-company and to find solutions for the company’s main problems according to international customer service.^

The idea of starting my own business has been developing at least for the last two years. The educational area for a future business has been selected based on a Russian language teacher's background and the business knowledge attained during my studies at Haaga-Helia. This thesis was intended to prepare the initial research for the development of a future business idea. The area of the new start up that was researched was Russian language studies and speech therapy for children. The objective of the project was to research the need for this new start up, to define its potential customer groups and to research the competition. The purpose of the research was to propose the most suitable service for potential customers, based on the collected data. The research was implemented by analyzing qualitative data, gathered by means of personal interviews and my own observations. The empirical part was made in December 2013 and January 2014, during which time active research was undertaken and interviews were held. The research resulted in suggesting products for a new start up, which is split into the following three groups: literature lessons for different age groups of young students, Russian language lessons for different age groups and speech therapy lessons. The growth of the Russian-speaking population, potential clients' wishes and the products that competitors offer were all taking into consideration when suggesting these specific services.

Strategic entrepreneurship in small business context
This master thesis is based on interviews and field studies in a small start-up company. The purpose was to observe innovation management during a new product launch and generally in start-up business environment with certain theoretical material comparison and analysis. The used method of analysis was near contextual inquiry type of ethnographic research method with elements from action type of research too and it belongs to qualitative research area. Main information collection system was interviews and discussions with the owner of the company during the process. Some discussions lead new ideas as a part of ongoing innovation management and sometimes interesting comparison were made to the theoretical part of thesis work. The most interesting theories received feedback during the interviews and discussions and were seen practical and even applicable for the daily innovation management. It can be said that during this participatory field studies innovations and information flowed both directions and it made this type of user-centered ethnographic research method interesting but a little challenging, too. It came clear to some extent that innovation management is not an easy area to handle in small scale or big scale. Good ideas are important but sometimes ideas are coming almost from an unknown and this fact can be somehow difficult to put in a framework and theory. Flow of good work energies and attitude seem to bring good ideas or let good opportunities to come visible. Based on interviews and feedback from the business case example there were at least two principles from the theoretical material of this thesis that became more visible. The red monkey description of the innovative organization with supporting role for innovative pioneers were seen interesting and the company may use this theory in the future recruitment processes. The transformation from the old 2 dimensional organizations to modern 3 dimensional innovative organizations were seen practical and interesting theoretical model as well as unconventional leadership of innovation management too.

BUSINESS ANALYSIS AND FUNCTIONALITY DESIGN FOR CONNECT COOPERATIVE
"Startupland is the story of Zendesk, founded in the kitchen of a Copenhagen loft, and now a 500-person company with customers in 140 countries and one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. Zendesk provides customer service software to major clients. Much like Zendesk's mission itself--to remove the friction, the barriers and the mystery in order to make software easier and more approachable--this book removes some of the myths about startups and startup founders. Instead of making things murky and complicated, this book inspires and empowers you to follow your own dream and create your own story. This book makes you want to go out and do something--not just because there's an opportunity in the market, or a path to make money, but because you want to build something that you believe in, are determined to design your own destiny, and understand that what you do matters.While there are books by consultants who tell you how to build businesses, or entrepreneurs now running billion dollar businesses, there are few books from people still in the trenches who acutely remember what it was like. Startupland is indispensable reading for all entrepreneurs who want to make their ideas the next big thing"--
