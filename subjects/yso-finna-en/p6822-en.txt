The aim of this thesis is to outline the special characteristics of small rural food-processing firms in Finland and find out the different ways they cooperate and network with each other. The emphasis is put on the value and significance of networking for the food-processing firms and how the networking could improve local food production.  The research is a qualitative research by the aid of expert interviews. It is carried out by interviewing both the entrepreneurs of rural food-processing firms and different retailers. The interviewees are chosen in order to tackle the same topic from different perspectives; to get the inner and outer picture of the situation.  Rural food-processing firms are becoming very business oriented and professional. The firms have always been cooperating with each other and cooperation is held very important for the continuity of the business. Benefits can be found in sharing costs and facilitating operations in different procedures, exchanging knowledge and giving support. Due to the lack of time and areal isolation the creation and maintenance of effective networks is anyway challenging. An effective network demands a strong leader, usually a retailer who is able to convince the producers of the positive effects of closer cooperation, time to build trust and create operations satisfying every party, and the matching of form of activity and the product.  The effort should be put on the education of producers and on the increase of the awareness of the benefits and the significance of networking by establishing open communication between all the involved parties in the local food chain. Since the demand for near produced food is growing and the operations of rural food-processing firms are becoming more and more business oriented, networking is supposed to be one of the key issues in building success.  This thesis is written and formatted following the guidelines of the IMC Krems University of Applied Sciences since the main establishment and hand over happened in this institution.
