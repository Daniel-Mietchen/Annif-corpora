"Responding to disruptive or troubled pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) remains a highly topical issue. The challenges these children present relate to wider issues of continuing political concern: the perceived declining discipline in schools; school and social exclusion; the limits to inclusion for children with special needs; increasing mental health difficulties in children; youth crime and parenting skills. This topical and exhaustively-researched Companion examines the difficulties of defining EBD, and the dangers of allocating this imprecise label to children. Bringing together the work of contributors from fifteen countries and across four continents, this book features the research of leading experts in the global field of EBD, who discuss and debate educators' key concerns by: - looking at the overlaps between EBD, ADHD and mental health difficulties; - outlining the types of appropriate schooling for children with EBD; - urging readers to look beyond pupils' challenging behaviour in order to understand and respond to the social, biological and psychological causation; - considering the key areas of assessment, whole-school and targeted approaches that help pupils with EBD in mainstream and in special settings; - outlining helpful work with families, the crucial contribution of effective multi-agency working and the importance of supporting and developing teachers who work with challenging pupils. Containing contrasting views on controversial topics, this Companion's approachable style makes it an essential reference book for academics, policy makers, practitioners, educators and students who are working towards a higher degree in education"--

The use of context in pragmatic language comprehension in normally developing children and children with Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism : an application of relevance theory
"This Handbook aims to provide an overview of current theoretical approaches and research in a range of topics related to child language. The field is multidimensional, as illustrated by the many courses on child language or language acquisition that are taught in departments of Linguistics, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Speech Pathology, Education and Anthropology. This cross disciplinary nature of the field is reflected in this Handbook, which is aimed at upper-level undergraduate students and beyond. Graduate students and researchers will find the chapters invaluable. Clinicians also will find some of the chapters of interest. In this introductory chapter we present a general overview of the field and some of the recent developments. In section 1.4 we discuss the organization of this volume and provide an overview of each chapter"--

"The best survey of the subject available, The Cambridge Handbook of Child Language brings together the world's foremost researchers to provide a one-stop resource for the study of language acquisition and development. Grouped into five thematic sections, the handbook is organized by topic, making it easier for students and researchers to use when looking up specific in-depth information. It covers a wider range of subjects than any other handbook on the market, with chapters covering both theories and methods in child language research and tracing the development of language from prelinguistic infancy to teenager. Drawing on both established and more recent research, the Handbook surveys the crosslinguistic study of language acquisition; prelinguistic development; bilingualism; sign languages; specific language impairment, language and autism, Down syndrome and Williams syndrome. This book will be an essential reference for students and researchers working in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, speech pathology, education and anthropology"--
"This comprehensive handbook reviews the major theoretical, methodological, and instructional advances that have occurred in the field of learning disabilities. With contributions from leading researchers, the volume synthesizes a vast body of knowledge on the nature of learning disabilities, their relationship to basic psychological and brain processes, and how students with these difficulties can best be identified and treated. Findings are reviewed on ways to support student performance in specific skill areas/m-/including language arts, math, science, and social studies/m-/as well as general principles of effective instruction that cut across academic domains. Authoritative and up to date, the book also examines the concepts and methods that guide learning disability research and identifies promising directions for future investigation"--
