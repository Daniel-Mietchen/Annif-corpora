This final thesis was a literal investigation about the effects of vibration to helicopter systems. The objective was to examine the vibration test result of the NH-90 multi-mission helicopter done by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health and determine if the vibration measured would possess any threats to the helicopters systems and avionics. The basic information about vibration in helicopter was collected using various literal sources like standards and books. The information about the actual threats caused by vibration to modern avionics was gathered from various university studies and other related articles. This was because the concept of how vibration may cause a threat to modern avionics is still considered rather fresh and the information was not that easy to achieve with the resources at hand. The test results were provided by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health. During the investigation it became clear that the vibration tests done by the Finnish Institute of Occupation Health was a rather narrow for this kind of investigation to be inclusive. Therefore, the objective of this work was not totally achieved and another vibration test must be done to achieve total satisfaction. Some ideas for the next possible vibration test are represented at the end of this work.
