This book contains the refereed contributions from the 41st annual meeting of ISOTT. The annual meetings of ISOTT bring together scientists from various fields (medicine, physiology, mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, etc.) in a unique international forum. Traditionally, ISOTT conferences are a place, where an atmosphere of interaction is created, where many questions are asked after each presentation and lively discussions occur at a high scientific level. This vivid interaction is the main motivation for members to participate and gain new ideas and knowledge in the broad field of oxygen transport to tissue. The papers in this volume summarize some of the outstanding contributions from the 41st annual meeting. Special features in this volume include invited presentations from senior members of ISOTT for the theme the wisdom of ISOTT in which founders, past presidents and prize winners from previous meetings provided both cutting edge new knowledge and integrated overviews of critical aspects of the field. The presentations and manuscripts also include those provided by the special opportunity provided by having part of the ISOTT meeting overlap with the EPR-2013 meeting where both focused on preclinical and clinical measurements of oxygen, with a particular emphasis on cancer.

"Includes information from 2012's 40th annual conference of the International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue (ISOTT), held in Bruges, Belgium. Covers aspects of oxygen transport from air to the cells, organs and organisms; instrumentation and methods to sense oxygen and clinical evidence. Includes contributions from scientists (physicists, biologists and chemists), engineers, clinicians and mathematicians. From the 40th annual conference of the International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue (ISOTT), held in Bruges, Belgium in August 2012, this volume covers aspects of clinical applications, muscle oxygenation, cancer, measurement technologies, oxygen transport modelling and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), cell metabolism and brain oxygenation. Each topic was presented by one or two invited speakers, and a series of contributed talks." -- (Springer)
