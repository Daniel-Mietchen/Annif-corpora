Abstract: The height of a vehicle's center-of-gravity (CG) is one factor that influences its handling characteristics. A number of height methods are used to measure CG within the automotive industry. This research determined which method has the greatest potential to produce accurate CG height measurements, given anticipated measurement tolerances.

The objective of this Bachelor’s thesis was to automate performance measurements done in the development of a radio transmitter and a receiver. The main objective was to develop measurement automation routines for five basic performance measurements using National Instruments LabVIEW as a software development environment. In order to meet this objective, a study of radio technology and their architecture was required. Additionally, a study of measurement systems and control was required. The developed software had to be modular to ease further development in future. The thesis was done for OY LM Ericsson AB site in Oulu, which is concentrated on the development of small-cell base station products. Measurement results gained with automation software were compared to those of manual measurements. As a result, main five measurements were successfully automated, and the results obtained matched those of manual measurements in terms of accuracy. Also, multiple smaller measurement automation routines were developed to ease automation development in the future. The thesis work was evaluated successful because of time and resources saved by the automation. In addition, it was possible to use the software modules in different additional measurements, for example in the testing of signal processing algorithms.

"An Essential Guide to Electronic Material Surfaces and Interfaces is a streamlined yet comprehensive introduction that covers the basic physical properties of electronic materials, the experimental techniques used to measure them, and the theoretical methods used to understand, predict, and design them. Starting with the fundamental electronic properties of semiconductors and electrical measurements of semiconductor interfaces, this text introduces students to the importance of characterizing and controlling macroscopic electrical properties by atomic-scale techniques. The chapters that follow present the full range of surface and interface techniques now being used to characterize electronic, optical, chemical, and structural properties of electronic materials, including semiconductors, insulators, nanostructures, and organics. The essential physics and chemistry underlying each technique is described in sufficient depth for students to master the fundamental principles, with numerous examples to illustrate the strengths and limitations for specific applications. As well as references to the most authoritative sources for broader discussions, the text includes internet links to additional examples, mathematical derivations, tables, and literature references for the advanced student, as well as professionals in these fields. This textbook fills a gap in the existing literature for an entry-level course that provides the physical properties, experimental techniques, and theoretical methods essential for students and professionals to understand and participate in solid-state electronics, physics, and materials science research"--
