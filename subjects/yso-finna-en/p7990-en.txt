The aim of this thesis was to introduce the current technology that can be used in the virtual reality in education and research at Oulu University of Applied Sciences and explain the construction process of the 3D virtual laboratory to Oulu UAS. The secondary goal was to explain the basic elements that are needed in order to create content in virtual environment and give the basic knowledge for the faculty and students of Oulu UAS of the virtual reality possibilities and equipment that are in use at Oulu UAS. In this thesis some of the various aspects of a virtual reality hardware and software are analysed in a relation to human senses and the human factors affecting it are explained, since the basic understanding of some aspects of the human physiological and psychological characteristics is required in order to comprehend the virtual reality technology implementation requirements in both the software and hardware. The sources used in this thesis were selected with the criteria how relevant they were in relation to each subject under consideration. The majority of the chosen sources are commonly distinguished and sources without a proper scientific background were avoided as much as possible. In conclusion the results of the construction of Oulu UAS 3D virtual laboratory and the proposals how maintain and improve the competence for the virtual reality use at Oulu UAS are presented.

The term immersion continues to be applied inconsistently within and across different fields of research connected with the study of virtual reality and interactive media. Moreover, immersion is oftentimes used interchangeably with the terms presence and engagement. This article details a review of existing definitions of immersion originating within the study of video games, virtual environments, and literary works of fiction. Based on this review, a three-dimensional taxonomy of the various conceptualizations of immersion is proposed. That is, the existing definitions of immersion may be broadly divided into three categories, each representing a dimension of the taxonomy: immersion as a property of a system, a subjective response to narrative contents, or a subjective response to challenges within the virtual environment. Finally, four distinct theories of presence are introduced and, based on the established taxonomy, we discuss how the individual theories relate to existing definitions of immersion.

This thesis is a study about criminal and offensive activity involving virtual worlds. It will cov-er cases purely taking place inside virtual worlds, as well as cases connected to them in some other way. The thesis will also discuss about the problems that current legislature and en-forcement of norms have in virtual worlds, and find out solutions to those problems. An overall look on the state of virtual worlds of today is also made. The issues of real world are increasingly influencing virtual worlds. Among these influences are crimes and offenses connected to these synthetic worlds which have risen during the recent years, mainly because of the commodification of these worlds. For the same reason, and because of the rise of said crime, the pressure for introducing more law and control into the virtual worlds will rise. However, the current legislature is ill-suited to tackle the problems of virtual domain. There is a fear that if applied, the current legislature and control would destroy the unique aspects of virtual worlds. The cases where court has given sentence for crime connected to virtual world were found to be rare, but existent. Offenses were no legal action were taken, on the other hand, were much more widespread. The most common offenses and crimes seem to be connected to money; getting one's account password with one way or another to steal the virtual assets, and sell them for real-world money. Another type of offense in virtual worlds is communication tort, such as defamation. The legal status of many copyright- and trademarks violations in Second Life, and selling of assets accumulated in massively multiplayer online role-playing games with real-world money is under debate, and unclear at the moment. To prevent the offensive- and criminal activities discussed, two suggested solutions are presented in the thesis. The research was mainly study of written sources, but two interviews and a survey was also conducted for the thesis. The survey was carried out purely inside Second Life. This thesis also discusses experiences about the survey, which can be useful for anyone planning to con-duct research purely inside virtual worlds. The scope of the thesis is limited to multiuser virtual worlds that are operated in the internet, for example Second Life and World of Warcraft. Small scale multiplayer computer games, chat's, IRC, social networking websites or blogs are not discussed. Also excluded are traditional forms of computer crimes, instead the thesis concentrates to special aspects of crimes involving virtual worlds.

In the future the afterlife will be digitised. Return to the world of Station in the sequel to the acclaimed Crashing Heaven. On Station the dead live on, haunting the living as Fetches; digital ghosts drawn from the downloaded memories of the deceased. And hell is a series of hard drives where those who cannot haunt are stored. But now one woman must journey into the hard drives to solve a murder. Even as the gods of Station face the dawn of a new age. Mixing classic cyberpunk tropes with a fresh take on how we will live in a virtually enhanced reality, worshipping corporations who have become gods, Al Roberston has established himself as a thoughtful and skilled writer of vastly intelligent, gripping SF thrillers.

The commissioner of this thesis is a company called CubiCasa. The reason for this thesis was the interest of CubiCasa on 3 different segments. The segments were AR/VR, home decoration and real estate business. The commissioner wanted to find out if it is profitable for the company to go and target these different segments. On these segments they also defined 4 different companies: InsiteVR, Augmented Pixels, CoContest and Zillow. Of these companies they wanted more information and if they should go and sell their products to them. Most of the used material were from the internet sources. Theory part of this thesis were gathered from books. Most of the segments were found to not be profitable for CubiCasa to sell their products to at this time. The company operating in real estate business, Zillow, is the most relevant ones from these companies and segments because of the technology of CubiCasa and their production process. But even in the case of Zillow CubiCasa still have to wait until they have managed to create an almost fully automated production process on the floor plans.
