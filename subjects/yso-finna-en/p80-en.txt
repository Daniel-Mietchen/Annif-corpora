Carter Sloan is a trained assassin--the best there is, pulled out of cryogenic sleep whenever an assignment demands his skills. So when he's kept in the deep freeze for 258 years, he's seriously annoyed. Yet his government needs him, to hunt down the enemy known as the Daughter of the Brass Dragon. The future of the galaxy-spanning Reich depends on it, so Sloan is off--screwing, swearing, and shooting his way across interstellar space.
American Pulp tells the story of the midcentury golden age of pulp paperbacks and how they brought modernism to Main Street, democratized literature and ideas, spurred social mobility, and helped readers fashion new identities. Drawing on extensive original research, Paula Rabinowitz unearths the far-reaching political, social, and aesthetic impact of the pulps between the late 1930s and early 1960s.
