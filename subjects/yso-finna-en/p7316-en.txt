Approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, and the rate of emergence of zoonotic diseases is on the rise. Bats are being increasingly recognised as an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. Understanding bats' role in emerging zoonotic diseases is crucial to this rapidly expanding area of research. Bats and Viruses: A New Frontier of Emerging Infectious Diseases provides an updated overview of research focusing on bat biology and the role bats play as hosts of many major zoonotic viruses. The text covers bat biology, immunology, and genomics. Chapters also delve into the various major bat-borne virus families, including lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses and reoviruses, among others.

Portugal has some geographical similarities with Finland: both are small and rather peripherical countries. However, the infection with the Human Immunodefi ciency Virus (HIV) has different patterns in Portugal from those in Finland. At the beginning of the 21st century, Portugal is in the fi rst place of the infection with the HIV, with an incidence rate of 105.8 cases per one million inhabitants. The main objective of this paper is to present and explain the geographical diffusion of HIV in Portugal at sub-region level with altogether 28 geographical areas. We were able to identify some geographic hot spot areas with SMR signifi cantly higher than 100. Some areas with AIDS mortality rates signifi cantly above the national standardized rates were identifi ed in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. It was found that the urban/rural dichotomy is the most important factor, explaining 47% and 32% of the variance for male and female AIDS mortality, respectively. This factor identifi es a clear opposition between the variables, with a geographical signifi cance.
Infections and nursing practice : prevention and control
"It has been estimated that in developed countries up to 10% of hospitalized patients develop infections every year. Not only is there a substantial cost to healthcare systems, but some healthcare associated infections (HCIAs) can be fatal. Since the majority of HCIAs are preventable, reducing HCIAs is now considered to be an integral part of patient safety and quality of care provided by all healthcare institutions worldwide. Unlike other books on infection control, the main strength of this book is to provide clear, up-to-date and practical guidance in infection control in an easy to read format which can act as a quick source of reference on all aspects of HCIA for healthcare workers who are either directly or indirectly involved in prevention and control of HCIAs. Although the book's main audience is infection control practitioners such as doctors, nurses, public health physicians, it is also a valuable reference for environmental health officers, health educators, practice managers in GP surgeries, and health service managers"--

Abstract: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) present a substantial problem for healthcare providers. The aim of this final project was to improve the safety of patients and health care practitioners in Infection Disease Clinic in Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH). This final project was a part of improving asepsis during the preparation, administration and management of peripheral intravenous therapy, a project conducted by the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in collaboration with Helsinki University Central Hospital. The purpose of the final project was to describe the principles' involved in the preparation, administration and management of peripheral intravenous therapy in the clinical setting. We conducted a systematic literature review of published studies that describe the principles of asepsis involved in the preparation, administration and management of peripheral intravenous therapy in the clinical setting from 2005 to January 2012. From a total of 1135 publications, only eight papers (0.7%) described the guidelines specific to peripheral intravenous therapy. A further 3 articles were selected from the reference list. We described the guidelines from the perspective on preparation, administration and management of peripheral intravenous therapy. Thematic synthesis of all text, figures, tables under the heading, key points, findings, results and discussion or conclusions reported in each included study was performed to develop descriptive and analytical themes. Eleven themes emerged. These themes were based on education of patients and health professionals, environment, hand hygiene, aseptic technique, skin preparation, Insertion of peripheral catheter, catheter-site dressing, maintaining sterile barrier, replacement of administration sets and peripheral catheters, documentation and performance improvement. The findings suggested that healthcare practitioners should always consider the patients as being susceptible. Standardization of practices will help reduce the risk of infection. Finally all health care practitioners must be educated to ensure that practices and procedures are adhered to and are consistent with day-to-day practices.

The book addresses the interdisciplinary scientific approach for the systemic understanding of connections between major human diseases and their treatment regime by applying the tools and techniques of nanotechnology. It also highlights the interdisciplinary collaborative researches for innovation in Biomedical Sciences. The book is aÂ first volume which presents collection of best papers presented in the First International Conference on Infectious Diseases and Nanomedicine held during Dec. 15-18, 2012 in Kathmandu, Nepal. The book focuses mainly on the topics: emerging infectious diseases; antimicrobial agents, vaccines and immunity; drug design, drug delivery and tissue engineering; and nanomaterials and biomedical materials.

Abstract: This final project is part of Improving the Quality of Hand Hygiene and Asepsis in the Care of Nephrological Patients, a project conducted by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, in collaboration with the Clinics of Nephrology and Infection Diseases of HUCH, the Department of Nursing Science of Turku University Faculty of Medicine, and the Finnish Kidney and Liver  Association.    The purpose of this final project is to identify interventions that can improve hand hygiene adherence in  haemodialysis patient care and, in addition, influence the implementation of change in clinical practice.    There were 15 research articles for this literature review, collected systematically from OVID, CINAHL and PUBMEB. In addition, manual search was conducted in order to find literature supporting the concepts of hand hygiene and asepsis.    The findings showed that single interventions improved hand hygiene adherence but, in order to reach a sustained high level of adherence, multifaceted interventional programmes focusing on education and behavioural change were preferred. They should include educational courses, trainings, poster campaigns, performance feedbacks, use of technology, accessibility to hand rub, and role modelling.    The implementation of change is a long process that depends on the quality and content of the interventions, the nurses' active participation and the support institutions can provide. Further development of multifaceted interventional programmes is needed to ensure that nurses have sufficient knowledge and awareness on hand hygiene and asepsis in the care of nephrological patients.
