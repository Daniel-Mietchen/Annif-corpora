Red wines made from Croatian autochthonous varieties were analyzed for their basic chemical compounds, anthocyanin profiles, total polyphenol contents, monomeric index and antioxidative capacity. Results of analysed red wines showed that alcohol and glycerol content was highest in Plavac mali and Babic wine, while the biggest difference was noted in the shikimic acid content ranging from 5 to 21 mg/l. Wine with the highest shikimic acid content (Crljenak viski) had also the lowest total anthocyanin content. All tested wines showed high antioxidative capacity ranging from 14.3 to 39.2 mmol/l while the total polyphenol content was between 1403 and 3633 mg/l. Marked variation was noted in contents of individual anthocyanins, with malvidin-3-monoglucoside as major compound in all analysed wines. Monomeric index showed some differences between analysed wines in monomeric and polymeric anthocyanin contents ranging from 3 to 9. Our results indicate that anthocyanin profile differences might determine considerable variations in the colour and composition of red wines.
