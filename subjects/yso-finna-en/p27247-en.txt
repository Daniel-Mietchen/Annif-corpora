Motivational interviewing : helping people change
Making and maintaining lasting changes in nutrition and fitness is not easy for anyone. Yet the communication style of a health professional can make a huge difference. This book presents the proven counseling approach known as motivational interviewing (MI) and shows exactly how to use it in day-to-day interactions with clients. MI offers simple yet powerful tools for helping clients work through ambivalence, break free of diets and quick-fix solutions, and overcome barriers to change. Extensive sample dialogues illustrate specific ways to enhance conversations about meal planning and preparation, exercise, body image, disordered eating, and more.
