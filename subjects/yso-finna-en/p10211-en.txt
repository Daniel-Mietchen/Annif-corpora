This Bachelor's thesis focuses on ways in which organisations work together to achieve desired goals that benefit people with disabilities and the wider community. The purpose is to analyse corporate social responsibility CSR initiatives, such as the employment of people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups, and their impact. The target organisations of the case study were VATES Foundation and Helsinki Co-operative Society Elanto, Finnish organisations with headquarters in Helsinki. The purpose of the VATES Foundation is to promote employment for disabled people and the aim of the organisation is to try to get more employment for people with disabilities within Finland. Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto provides for example grocery and restaurant services for the residents of the Greater Helsinki in Finland. The aim of the thesis is to understand exactly how CSR initiatives are carried out, both from the VATES Foundation's and Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto's perspective. The aim is to provide a wider overview of CSR Initiatives and offer suggestions and improvement ideas these practices. The focus is also on the benefits of creating alliances between organisations or firms for these purposes. The theoretical framework of the thesis covers wide aspects of the basic CSR concepts and theories, such as the central definitions, concepts, CSR at workplace, sustainability, reasons for CSR engagement, standards and their measurement, and stakeholder relations. The results revealed that both VATES Foundation and Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto have taken positive steps since the beginning of the 1990's towards corporate social initiatives, towards employment for people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups. The top management commitment and efficient communications and resources allocations have enhanced positive contribution towards the needs of the community around them, the needs of their nation and the needs of the community in the wider world.

All libraries have patrons and staff members with disabilities, making equitable service a priority for these organizations as they provide diverse services to their entire communities. Although rapid technological changes in recent years have offered challenges to libraries, these same technologies provide opportunities to embrace the concept of accessible library services and create innovative new services for patrons with disabilities. Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities and the Inclusive Future of Libraries, edited by Brian Wentz, Paul T. Jaeger, and John Carlo Bertot, focuses on the issues at the intersection of disability, accessibility, inclusion and libraries. The chapters in this volume provide best practices and innovative ideas to share amongst libraries, explore the roles that internet and communication technologies play in the context of inclusive libraries, illuminate the important contributions of libraries in promoting social inclusion of and social justice for people with disabilities, and help libraries to better articulate their contributions in these areas as they engage with disability groups, funders, policymakers, and other parts of their communities.

Implementing a program for parents with intellectual disability in Sweden : a feasibility study
The number of people on long-term disability benefits in Europe is rising and this group is particularly at risk of social exclusion. Although many of those away from work for a long period due to illness or injury would like to rejoin the workforce, very few actually do so in practice. This situation means that potential workers are absent from the labour market and there is pressure on social security systems. One of the key strategies for reversing this trend and helping long-term benefit claimants to return to work is a system of effective employment guidance and counselling services. By looking at case studies in 10 Member States, this report identifies examples of good practice in employment services for people who have become disability claimants in the course of their working lives. It concludes that there is overall a lack of awareness of the specific needs of people on long-term disability benefits and a need for a wider range of initiatives specially targeted at this group.
