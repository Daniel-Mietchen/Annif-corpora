A sociological study is the first comprehensive study of literary translation in modern Iran, covering the period from the late 19th century up to the present day. By drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's sociology of culture, this work investigates the people behind the selection, translation, and production of novels from English into Persian. The choice of novels such as Morier's The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Vargas Llosa's The War of the End of the World provides insights into who decides upon titles for translation, motivations of translators and publishers, and the context in which such decisions are made.The author suggests that literary translation in Iran is not a straightforward activity. As part of the field of cultural production, literary translation has remained a lively game not only to examine and observe, but also often a challenging one to play. By adopting hide-and-seek strategies and with attention to the dynamic of the field of publishing, Iranian translators and publishers have continued to play the game against all odds. The book is not only a contribution to the growing scholarship informed by sociological approaches to translation, but an essential reading for scholars and students of Translation Studies, Iranian Studies, and Middle Eastern Studies..

Georg Lukács and Thomas Mann, two of the great figures in the history of twentieth-century cultural life, had a complex literary relationship. In this study Judith Marcus suggests that Mann's character Leo Naphta in The Magic Mountain is modeled on Lukács—the Jewish intellectual. Professor Marcus goes on to argue that Mann consistently portrayed this "ideal type" throughout his work as ironically containing a "totalitarian" personality which was inspired by radicalism, rigidity, dogmatism, and asceticism—all negative traits that Mann found in Lukács and that prevented the growth of personal intimacy between these two men. Marcus's study is largely based on Lukács's and Mann's early work, on their correspondence, and on previously undiscovered, untranslated, and/or unpublished archival materials. Her research was carried out in three countries and in interviews conducted with Lukács, Katja Mann, Ernst Bloch, and Arnold Hauser, among others.

"This book takes us into the social networks of contemporary literary culture, examining how small-scale presses, writers, book distributors, and editors make new fiction-and make a living-in a mass market indifferent to all but a tiny slice of the literature produced today. McSweeney's, the small San Francisco-based press founded by Dave Eggers, is the book's central subject, but the story of that press serves also as portal to broader networks of contemporary literary production, a network that requires not one person-like the famous Eggers-but thousands. How does new writing emerge and find readers today? Why does one writer's work become famous while another's remains invisible? Making literature now tells the stories of the creators, editors, readers, and critics who make their living by making literature itself come alive. The book shows how various conditions--including gender, education, business dynamics, social networks, money, and the forces of literary tradition--affect the things we can choose, or refuse, to read. Amy Hungerford focuses her discussion on literary bestsellers as well as little-known traditional and digital literature from smaller presses, such as McSweeney's. She deftly matches the particular human stories of the makers with the impersonal structures through which literary reputation is made. Ranging from fine-grained ethnography to polemical argument, this book transforms our sense of how and why new literature appears--and disappears--in contemporary American culture"--

In this new book Zygmunt Bauman and Riccardo Mazzeo examine the contentious issue of the relation between literature (and the arts in general) and sociology (or, more generally, a branch of the humanities claiming scientific status). While many commentators see literature and sociology as radically different vocations, Bauman and Mazzeo argue that they are bound together by a common purpose and a shared subject matter. Despite the many differences in terms of their methods and their ways of presenting their findings, novels and sociological texts are not at cross-purposes. Indeed, it is precisely their differences that make them at once indispensable to each other and mutually complementary. The writers of novels and of sociological texts may explore their world from different perspectives, seeking and producing different types of 'data', but their products bear the unmistakable marks of their shared origin. They feed each other and depend on each other in terms of their agenda, their discoveries and the contents of their messages. In a world characterized by the continuous search for new sensations and the fetishism of consumption, they bring fundamental existential questions back to the public agenda. Literature and sociology reveal the truth of the human condition only when they stay in one another's company, remaining attentive to each other's findings and engaged in a continuous dialogue. For only together can they rise to the challenging task of untangling and laying bare the complex intertwining of biography and history as well as of individual and society that totality we are constantly shaping while being shaped by it.
