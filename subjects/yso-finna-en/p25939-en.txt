Working with sensitizing concepts : analytical field research
For centuries the practice of undertaking fieldwork and expeditions has been adopted as an essential part of research by scientists and scholars from diverse disciplines. As a method of collecting on-site data through observation, the practice is shared by disciplines ranging from biology and botany, through geology, geography, and archaeology to anthropology, linguistics, and folklore studies. Presenting 17 essays by 17 scholars from almost as many disciplines of knowledge, this volume contains a rich tapestry of stories from - and about - 'the field', from early modern times until the present day. Taking us around the globe, from Europe to Asia, from the Arctic to Africa and America, this book investigates the entanglement of scientific, political, social, cultural, and personal interests and agendas that have shaped, and still shape, our effort to explore, explain, and exploit the world.

The politics and ethics of fieldwork
The world of religious experience is changing much faster than the discipline which claims to study it. Religious studies still uses Christianity as its measure, still frames the world through the model of five world religions, still largely avoids analysis of key issues around power, poverty, violence, pollution, science, and social conflict, and still looks to highlight differences rather than commonalities. Methods for the Study of Religious Change aims to redefine the study of religion as the study of worldviews, of ideas which are active in shaping the world. It argues that the study of religion should focus on people's worldview-making capacities and should contribute to the critical analysis of global problems and the promotion of cultural and spiritual respect across religions. Survey chapters on theory and method outline this new approach while case-study chapters illustrate these ideas with innovative ethnographies of ritual, experience, language, morals and identity.

Unearthing the past : the great discoveries of archeology from around the world
Archaeology has progressed enormously since the early excavations of classical sites such as Olympia and Ephesus in the middle of the 19th century. A better perspective on the material culture of the classical world is now given by new methods and modern techniques, which depend on the rigorous application of skills from a wide range of disciplines. This book, written by a group of active field archaeologists, is designed particularly for students at A-level and on university courses, as well as for those with a general interest in the ancient world. It demonstrates the progression of a project from planing and prospection, through excavation and study to interpretation and public presentation. It also provides links to a wide range of internet resources to enable students to follow through case studies of recent survey and excavation ranging in time from the Bronze Age to the early Byzantine, and in extent from Britain to Turkey.
