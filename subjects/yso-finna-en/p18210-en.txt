Understanding this concept is essential to improving performance for both the individual and organization, and authors Peter Clough and Doug Strycharczyk explain mental toughness clearly and effectively. This new updated edition includes greater coverage of how mental toughness relates to other behaviors and can be applied to leadership, creativity, emotional intelligence, and motivation. It also looks at applications in employability and entrepreneurship, and expands its coverage of coaching for mental toughness. "--

"Mental toughness is about how effectively individuals respond to stress, pressure and challenge. It is rooted in the notion of resilience but moves beyond this by being highly applicable and measurable. Understanding this concept is essential to improving performance for both the individual and organization, and this ground-breaking book explains mental toughness clearly and effectively. Tracing its development from sports psychology into the world of business, health and education, Developing Mental Toughness was the first book to look at applications at the organizational level and to provide a reliable psychometric measure. The new edition includes greater coverage of how mental toughness relates to other behaviours and can be applied to leadership, creativity, emotional intelligence, and motivation. It also looks at its applications in employability and entrepreneurship, and there will be expanded coverage of coaching for mental toughness. Written for anyone coaching individuals and teams for improved performance, the book contains practical guidance and techniques, exercises, case studies and the Mental Toughness self-assessment tool"--
