The subject of this Bachelor's thesis is Almaco Group Oy's material logistics in a ship refurbishment project. The objective was to study the current logistics chain and to find out the bottlenecks of material packing and material packing markings as well as to find solutions to the problems that were detected. The need for the research was noticed when the refurbishment project in Singapore was underway. The material packing lists were incomplete and the packing of materials delicate to moisture and hits was insufficient. The focus of this thesis is on the development of packing lists, labels, and improvement of packing materials. The research is based on the writer's own experience as a project assistant in the project in Singapore and interviewing the people who are responsible for the logistics of the company. Solutions for problems arisen were searched by studying the essential information. The theory chapter of the thesis includes information about logistics and the importance of successful logistics to companies in general. Theory, interviews and the writer's own conclusions were used to create improvement suggestions to the packing lists, as well as to sufficient packing. The main emphasis in the thesis was on financial savings, because improvements should always create savings for the company. A model for the packing lists making the project work faster and simpler was created in the thesis. In material packing the emphasis was on clarifying the ways different materials are packed. Furthermore, methods for the delivery of large amounts as well as the packing of materials delicate to moisture and hits were presented. The company needs to engage in carrying out the changes presented in the thesis in order to see whether they will bring results and financial benefits. This will require carrying the changes out in a few projects.
