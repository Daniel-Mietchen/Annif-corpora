A magnificent history of the gene and a response to the defining question of the future: What becomes of being human when we learn to "read" and "write" our own genetic information? Siddhartha Mukherjee has a written a biography of the gene as deft, brilliant, and illuminating as his extraordinarily successful biography of cancer. Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.

"Biotechnology is delivering not only new products to diagnose, prevent, and treat human diseases but entirely new approaches to a wide range of difficult biomedical challenges. Because of advances in biotechnlogy, hundreds of new therapeutic agents, diagnostic tests, and vaccines have been developed and are available in the marketplace. In this jargon-free, easy-to-read textbook, the authors demystify the discipline of medical biotechnology and provide a fundamental understanding of the wide-ranging approaches pursued by scientists to diagnose, prevent, and treat medical conditions."--Back cover.
