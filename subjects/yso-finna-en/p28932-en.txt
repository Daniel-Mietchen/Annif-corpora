E-Business in the 21st Century : Realities Challenges and Outlook
All over the world people are exploring what information literacy means in the 21st century. The authors provide a review of trends and theories, and suggest a model that "allows lifelong learners to create meaning through an interactive and participatory social network. Today's learners communicate, create, and share information using a range of information technologies such as social media, blogs, microblogs, wikis, mobile devices and apps, virtual worlds, and MOOCs. In this book the authors present a comprehensive structure for information literacy theory that builds on decades of practice while recognizing the knowledge required for an expansive and interactive information environment. The concept of metaliteracy expands the scope of traditional information skills (determine, access, locate, understand, produce, and use information) to include the collaborative production and sharing of information in participatory digital environments (collaborate, produce, and share) prevalent in today's world. Combining theory and case studies, the authors: Show why media literacy, visual literacy, digital literacy, and a host of other specific literacies are critical for informed citizens in the twenty-first century ; Offer a framework for engaging in today's information environments as active, self-reflective, and critical contributors to these collaborative spaces ; Connect metaliteracy to such topics as metadata, the Semantic Web, metacognition, open education, distance learning, and digital storytelling. This approach to information literacy helps students grasp an understanding of the critical thinking and reflection required to engage in technology spaces as savvy producers, collaborators, and sharers. -- From publisher's website.
This book focuses on mobile learning design from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It introduces and discusses how mobile learning can be effectively integrated into curricula, highlighting the design of four key components of learning-centric pedagogy: Resource, Activity, Support and Evaluation in the context of mobile learning. It also investigates the learning theories underpinning mobile learning design, and includes case studies in different contexts. It provides practical insights that allow teachers to change and transform teaching practices using mobile technology. Anyone involved in mobile-technology enhanced learning and teaching will find this book both informative and useful.

Mobile learning : the next generation
"As technology evolves we are ever more reliant on the use of handheld and mobile devices, yet what do we know about their impact on learning? While there is a lot of interest in mobile technology, many schools still aren't sure how to best use it for learning and teaching. Learning with Handhelds and Mobiles explores this landscape and offers examples of how these technologies have been used for learning, how the problems that have arisen are being addressed, and offers ideas for the future. This invaluable book gives a voice to teachers and educators using mobiles and technology-enhanced learning in and out of schools, for regular school work and for innovative projects through exciting partnerships like Apps for Good.Learning with Handhelds and Mobiles shows the changes that are taking place within schools as a direct result of these emerging technologies, and contains case studies with accounts of best practice in a variety of settings including primary, secondary, and special schools, and learning beyond their boundaries. The book also explores themes of pedagogy, communication and affordances, collaborative learning, individual creativity and expression, self-directed and informal learning and outdoor education.The learning potential of handheld and mobile devices has excited teachers and educators, but until now there has been no structured, systematic overview available along with reflections on how this technology is changing educational practice. This book brings these together to provide a clearer picture of what is currently a fragmented area, and offers expert views of how we can understand these, and where it may take us next"--
