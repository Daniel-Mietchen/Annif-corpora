Basque is the sole survivor of the very ancient languages of western Europe. Due to its unusual structure and its seeming lack of relatives, the language has long been the object of curiosity and speculation. More than a century of specialist work has succeeded in shedding a great deal of light on the history and especially the prehistory of Basque, but this work has up until now been almost entirely confined to the specialist literature, and has not been available to general historical linguists. This book, written by an internationally renowned specialist in Basque, finally rectifies the problem. It provides a comprehensive survey of all that is known about the prehistory of the language, including pronunciation, the grammar and the vocabulary. It also provides a long critical evaluation of the search for relatives, as well as a thumbnail sketch of the language, a summary of its typological features, an external history and an extensive bibliography.

Published in association with UNESCO, Democracy and Human Rights in Multicultural Societies examines the political governance of cultural diversity, specifically how public policy-making has dealt with the claims for cultural recognition that have increasingly been expressed by ethno-national movements, language groups, religious minorities, indigenous peoples and migrant communities. Its principle aim is to understand, explain and assess public-policy responses to ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity. Adopting interdisciplinary perspectives of comparative social sciences, the contributors address the conditions, forms, and consequences of democratic and human-rights-based governance of multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-faith societies.
