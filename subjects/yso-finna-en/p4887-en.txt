This Bachelor's thesis was commissioned by a firm called “IGO Toiminimi“ and the aim of it was to develop a web application to help both the company and private users to post and advertise cars they are selling, renting or exchanging. To develop this application few technologies and tools were used. They include PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap (to design the interface) and Sublime Text (as a source code editor). It was able to use these tools and technologies by integrating each other to give the desired output. As a result there is a working program that runs in a “localhost” server connection. Users can register and log in to the system in order to interact with the application. As it has not been tested on a real working server on a web, in future the development requires more options for the users for a better interaction with the system in a user friendly and easy way. More technologies might also need to be introduced for a faster and better outcome.

This master’s thesis was commissioned by The Qt Company. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how a side by side and on top of each other stackable multi-screen view can be done with several units. The target was to make it easily duplicate from few to several units. Each and every unit had to contain a screen to show content and computer to produce to the content for the screen. The framework target was also to be useful in low end computers such as Raspberry PI. The investigation was done with a Qt programming language and its possibilities to use different types of hardware in a computer. The investigation also includes how Qt is suitable for transferring data in different ways between processes and network. Mainly the investigation was done as a software development. It means that a piece of source code was implemented in a computer and it was then tested. This testing was also done in the final target hardware. As a result a proof of concept was produced. It was tested in a couple of different environments. One test was between two laptop computers and another test was with laptop and Raspberry PI. Both true tests showed that the proof of concept framework works.

Coding, once considered an arcane craft practiced by solitary techies, is now recognized by educators and theorists as a crucial skill, even a new literacy, for all children. Programming is often promoted in K-12 schools as a way to encourage "computational thinking" -- which has now become the umbrella term for understanding what computer science has to contribute to reasoning and communicating in an ever-increasingly digital world. In Connected Code, Yasmin Kafai and Quinn Burke argue that although computational thinking represents an excellent starting point, the broader conception of "computational participation" better captures the twenty-first-century reality. Computational participation moves beyond the individual to focus on wider social networks and a DIY culture of digital "making." Kafai and Burke describe contemporary examples of computational participation: students who code not for the sake of coding but to create games, stories, and animations to share; the emergence of youth programming communities; the practices and ethical challenges of remixing (rather than starting from scratch); and the move beyond stationary screens to programmable toys, tools, and textiles.

The objective of this thesis was to design and develop an interactive web application for TeliaSonera. The application was meant to become easy and simple to use. The application is a staff directory and it is based on a tool that was previously developed for TeliaSonera. The target group for this application are the employees of TeliaSonera but especially the newcomers. This application is used to search contacts, who you can ask for help and advice with solving any problem related with TeliaSonera.Tags are used to find the contacts. The application was made interactive by programming it with JavaScript and jQuery which is a JavaScript Library. PHP was used to make web application dynamic. PostgreSQL object-relational database management system was used as a database server.
