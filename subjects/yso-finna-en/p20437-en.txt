"Critical insight from the man Fortune called "the world's leading expert on business strategy". About the only thing a leader can be sure of is that what worked yesterday is unlikely to work today, let alone tomorrow. Never before have businesses faced a more fractured, contentious and dynamic environment. If ever there was a need for fundamentally new thinking about values, competition, leadership, organization talent, and how these things are directly tied to management, it is now. Gary Hamel lays out an essential agenda in a world where old nostrums aren't merely useless, but downright toxic. Contains more than 25 standalone chapters in six sections that are brutally honest and tackle critical management and leadership challenges head-on Explains how to move from defense to offense, reverse the tide of commoditization, and outrun change Tackles how to effectively hack management, capture the moral high ground, and foster extraordinary contribution Written by one of the world's most prescient management experts and the acclaimed author of The Future of Management Concise and to the point, What Matters Now will inspire leaders to rethink their business, their management, and how they lead"--

Abstract: The goal of this thesis was to determine the state of resources effecting into customer service quality. In this thesis was focused on competence of the staff, job tasks, work motivation, work satisfaction, atmosphere and leadership. Information gathering was conducted by a survey, which was sent in an email to all of the employees, 20 in total.  Hacklin Logistics is an international company and therefore not all of the employees speak Finnish. The survey was carried out during October 2016 and was made in English. The response rate was fairly good as it was 65 %, so 11 out of 20 employees answered. The survey was a structured survey with readymade answer possibilities. The respondents were also given a chance to answer into a few open ended questions.  The theoretical part entails information about competence, organizational culture and atmosphere, motivation and leadership. To help gather the information was used many different sources; literature, internet and former case studies. From these sources, the author has looked up information regarding all the objectives of this thesis. The topic was rather wide, so it had to be narrowed down to avoid going off point. The author gathered the empirical data with the survey described above. The response rate was 65 % so 11 respondents out of 20.  In the later part of the thesis one can find the survey results and conclusion. After these the author has given some suggestions on how the case company would be able to improve their employee's motivation level, and wellbeing at the office. The overall answers received from the survey were good. Both, good aspects and aspects that need more attention were taken into consideration in this thesis. The results are relatively reliable. There are some aspects that might lower the reliability of the answers. Recommendation for further research was to re-do the survey after some time has passed in order to get information which is comparable with this study. The survey could also be altered so, that it could be held for customers and partner companies.
