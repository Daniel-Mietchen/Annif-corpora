Throughout the book we focus on the practical elements of developing the crowd risk analysis and crowd safety aspects of an event plan, with consideration to places of public assembly, major events and large-scale urban environments. We define a range of modelling techniques, including line diagrams that represent crowd flow, calculations of the speed at which a space can fill, and of the time it takes for that space to reach critical and then crush density. We define a method of understanding, * Over the years, a variety of associates have worked with the author, in the field, on operational research, development and teaching activities described throughout the book.
