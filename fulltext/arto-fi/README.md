# Finnish language articles from Arto database

This corpus contains 6298 Finnish language articles extracted from the Arto
database. The articles themselves are not stored in the repository, but must
be fetched separately from the URLs stored in `.url` files.

## Retrieving the PDFs

You can fetch the PDF files using the Makefile:

    make pdf

However, most of the files are located on the
[Elektra](http://elektra.helsinki.fi/) service which restricts access to
Finnish universities and public libraries.
