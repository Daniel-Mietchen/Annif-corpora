Duane Hanson : more than reality
Here is the fourth and final volume in Abrams' definitive series on Photorealism, one of the most popular contemporary art movements. The first three volumes reproduced all Photorealist paintings created before 2000. 'Photorealism In The Digital Age' includes 841 full-colour artworks produced since 2000. Photorealists work painstakingly from photographs to create startlingly real paintings, sometimes as few as four in any given year. Where once they used cameras and film as tools for gathering information, they now rely on digital technology, which has vastly expanded the amount of detail that can be captured in an image. They bring new insights to vernacular subjects and succeed in making the commonplace "uncommon". Meisel covers every major Photorealist still active as well as artists new to the movement. For the first time he also includes Photorealist-like sculpture.
