The terms 'Woman' and 'Women' have been the organizing concepts for feminist politics and scholarship on women in western countries for several centuries. 'Women', it was assumed, shared characteristics based on biology and experiences of subordination; other aspects of their lives, such as language, national or ethnic identity, 'race', or sexual orientation were considered secondary to the identity of woman-ness. In this work, Dhruvarajan and Vickers call into question feminism's presumed universality of gender analysis, and bring to the foreground the voices of marginalized women in Western society, and of women outside of the western world. Gender, Race, and Nation discusses opening scholarship to the experiences of women in all of their diversity, making links between the differences in local contexts and global contexts, and relating to other women with the understanding of each woman's relative position in terms of power and privilege to facilitate coalition building and develop strategies to address issues of common concern to usher in a just and caring world for all. This change in perspective presented by Dhruvarajan and Vickers represents a paradigm shift in the study of women and women's issues, and forges a new approach to women's studies/scholarship on women, women' s movements, and global social transformation.

"This volume is devoted to the relationship between political and social dimensions of nation-building in Estonia. The authors of the volume analyse the Estonian nation-building since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and Estonia regained independence, in the context of post-communist transformation and globalization. Such a double macro-historical change has brought about highly polarized views in society between the ethnic Estonian and Russian-speaking communities on a number of key aspects of nation-building, like ethnic policy, meaning of national integration, etc. The volume argues that national integration can progress only via formation of a unifying citizen identity in Estonia, embedded within democratic political processes"--Publisher's description, back cover.

Most theories of material culture, transnationalism, and globalization have failed to incorporate a focus on emotions even though an increasing number of scholars in recent years have explored emotion-dense processes. This book fills the gap and examines how emotions can be theorized and serve as a useful analytical tool for understanding the interrelated mobility of humans, objects, and images. Through diverse, ethnographically rich and theoretically grounded case studies, these chapters offer new perspectives that relate migration, material culture, and emotions by addressing: the ways in which migrants and migrant artists express their emotions through objects and images in transnational contexts; the ways in which particular works of art, everyday objects, and artifacts evoke specific feelings in migrants and members of migrant communities; and the ways in which artists, academics, and policy makers may stimulate positive interaction between migrants and members of local communities.

The South Asian diaspora came into being with the end of slavery in the British Empire. Huge numbers of labourers were recruited in the Indian sub-continent for indentured labour schemes, notably in Southeast Asia, South and East Africa, Mauritius, Fiji and the Caribbean, and also in French colonies. Later there were waves of 'free' immigration to these and other countries, including, in the last generation, Britain itself and North America.
