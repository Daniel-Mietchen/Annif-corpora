The award-winning first edition of "The Promise of Mediation," published ten years ago, is a landmark classic that changed the field's understanding of the theory and practice of conflict intervention. That volume first articulated the "transformative model" of mediation, which greatly humanized the vision of how the mediation process could help parties in conflict. In the past decade, the transformative model has proved itself and gained increasing acceptance. It is now being used in such diverse arenas as workplace, community, family, organizational, and public policy conflicts, among others. In this new edition, the authors draw on a decade of work in theory development, training, practice, research, and assessment to present a thoroughly revised and updated account of the transformative model of mediation and its practical application, including a compelling description of how the field has moved toward increasing acceptance of the transformative model a new and clearer presentation of the theory and practices of transformative mediation, with many concrete examples a new case study that provides a vivid picture of the model in practice, with a commentary full of new information about how to use it effectively clarifications of common misconceptions about the model a vision for the future that shows how the model can coexist with other approaches and where the "market" for transformative mediation is emerging This volume is a foundational resource on transformative practice, for both readers of the first edition and new readers - including mediators, facilitators, lawyers, administrators, human resource professionals, policymakers, and conflictresolution researchers and educators. More generally, this book will strike a chord with anyone interested in humanizing our social institutions and building on a relational vision of society.

It includes new coverage of social media, social networking sites, and terrorist threats and draws upon recent work from management, public relations, organizational psychology, marketing, organizational communication, and computer-mediated communication research.

Crisis leadership : through the eyes of successful founder-CEOs
This brief, theoretically grounded, yet practical text has proven successful with both student and professional audiences, offering clear, usable advice on how to manage the conflicts that arise on the job and in personal relationships. Important chapters dealing with issues of intercultural communication and gender have been revised and rewritten to reflect the most current research, and the unique material on conflict and writing allows students to gain insight into a medium of communication overlooked by most texts. The authors have created a five-step model of approaching and analyzing interpersonal conflict, and this model is applied repeatedly to different topics, providing students with a genuinely effective structure for working through differences with colleagues, friends, and others they might encounter.
