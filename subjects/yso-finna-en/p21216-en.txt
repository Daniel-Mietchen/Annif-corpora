Language learners' seeking paths and strategies : one dimension of digital literacy
What would a synthetic theory of digital, media and information literacy (DMIL) look like? Radical Information Literacy presents, for the first time, a theory of DMIL that synthesises the diversity of perspectives and positions on DMIL, both in the classroom and the workplace, and within the informal learning processes of society. This title is based on original analysis of how decisions are made about the relevance of information and the other resources used in learning, showing how society has privileged objective approaches (used in rule-based decision making) to the detriment of subjective and intersubjective perspectives which promote individual and community contexts. The book goes on to analyse the academic and popular DMIL literature, showing how the field may have been, consciously or unwittingly, complicit in the 'objectification' of learning and the disempowerment of individuals and communities. Alternative ways of conceiving the subject are then presented, towards a reversal of these trends.* Synthesises key theorists of digital, media and information literacy and information behaviour* Includes the field of 'community informatics'* Conducts a bibliometric analysis of a broad spectrum of writings on digital, media and information literacy, analysing the connections between them and the frames of DMIL within which they are located.

Media literacy : keys to interpreting media messages
With the development of new information and communication technologies, new concepts of extending the concept of literacy have emerged, such as media literacy, computer literacy, and information literacy. This paper addresses literary literacy as a form of extended literacies. The notion of literary here comprehends widely various fields of literature, with artistic literature as one, although in a sense paradigmatic, instance. The aspects of reading and literacy emphasized in this paper will have particular educational significance in contexts of general school education. Hermeneutics is a classical discipline of how we should read. It emphasizes aspects of appropriative, or Bildung-oriented, reading that we can oppose to the instrumental use of what one reads. Within hermeneutics, and particularly the sociological studies of literature, the paper also finds foundations for critical reading. There would be, however, a tension between the fundamentally hermeneutical appropriative literacy and critical questioning, and the notion of literary literacy should contain a dialect between them. The paper emphasizes the significance of literary literacy, since there is a danger that it disappears behind more instrumentally emphasized notions of literacy. Similarly, there is a risk that the everyday plausibility of the demand of being critical suffocates the appropriative aspects of literacy and reading.

This book is a collection of papers presented in the Finnish Educational Research Association Conference on Education FERA 2013, which was held in University of Jyväskylä in November 21-22, 2013. The title of the book, Enabling Education, encompasses the conference theme − Education for future well-being and teaching excellence. The word Education has purposefully been written with a capital letter in the book title. Education with a big E is something which initiates us into the kinds of practices that foster the good life for each person and the good for humankind. The capital letter implies that Education with a big E is something more than schooling which has transformed education into standardized, factory-like practices. As the keynote speaker of the conference Stephen Kemmis puts it: ”Schooling is to produce people with skills for production and the means for consumption, and people who are willing providers and grateful clients of services. (…) Education, by contrast, is a process of individual and collective self-formation, a simultaneous process of growing good selves and good societies.” Education with a big E is not limited to conventional school-based settings. It happens in everyday life, and it is a life-long journey. It may take place outdoors and through adventures as well as in peoples��� homes, on trains and streets via portable electronic devices. It may be about cultural education − music, arts, and crafts as well as literature, video clips, and digital stories. Education requires inter-professional collaboration and presupposes the strong agency of the educators. Education is something very practical and simultaneously deeply philosophical and ethical. The eleven chapters of this book shed light on all these aspects of Education with a big E.

Literacy in the new media age
Media Literacy and the Emerging Citizen is about enhancing engagement in a digital media culture and the models that educators, parents and policy makers can utilize to place media-savvy youth into positions of purpose, responsibility and power. Two specific challenges are at the core of this book’s argument that media literacy is the path toward more active and robust civic engagement in the 21st century: How can media literacy enable core competencies for value-driven, diverse and robust digital media use? How can media literacy enable a more civic-minded participatory culture? These challenges are great, but they need to be examined in their entirety if media literacy is to begin to address the opportunities they present for democracy, participation and discourse in a digital media age. By presenting information that places media literacy at the center of what it means to be an engaged citizen, educators and policy makers will understand why media literacy must be integrated into formal and informal education systems before it’s too late.
