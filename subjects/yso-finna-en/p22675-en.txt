Life as a mortal is horrifying and hazardous for the former water god Habaek. His fragile human form has been cursed by a jealous goddess, and his vengeful mother--unaware of his sincere love for Soah--seeks to kill his human bride! While his mother wishes to pull Habaek back into the realm of the gods, another goddess simply wants to see Habaek and Soah suffer on earth. And other envious humans and gods bring further problems to the star-crossed lovers.
