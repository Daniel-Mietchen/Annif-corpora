Hempcrete Noise Barrier Wall for Highway Noise Insulation : Research & Construction
The aim of this thesis was to study the effects of sound reverberation on noise levels in the gymnastics areas of the new sports hall. The sports club commissioned this thesis after identifying a problem in the new sports hall, as the gymnasts reported that background noise due to poor acoustics was disturbing their concentration and speech intelligibility. The sound reverberation time was measured to find out the acoustic response. The reverberation time was measured in three large open gymnastic areas that are separated from each other by walls. The results of the measurements show that reverberation times in two out of the three gymnastic areas exceed the recommended limits on voice frequencies. Only one gymnastics area had values inside the limits. Based on the results, the conclusion can be drawn that long reverberation is increasing the background noise. As an improvement, installation of acoustic panels or intermediate curtains is proposed in order to reduce the reverberation in the gymnastic areas. Acoustic panels should be attached to the sound-reflective walls in such a way that at least two adjacent perpendicular walls are paneled. Each of the gymnastic areas should be paneled in this way. Roof paneling is optional since the soft training platforms on the floor are sufficient to decrease the vertical reverberation.

Extremely loud : sound as a weapon
Designed to accompany the new Open University course in Environmental Monitoring and Protection, this is one of four new titles which will equip the reader with the tools to undertake Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). Used in planning, decision-making and management, EIAs review both the theoretical principles and environmental considerations of engineering and environmental projects to help steer fundamental legislation in the right direction. This book will cover the basic principles and concepts of sound and sound propagation, covering units, crite.
