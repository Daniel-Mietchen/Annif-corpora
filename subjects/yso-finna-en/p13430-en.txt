VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland helps their clients to create more competit - ive business using information technology. They offer their services especially in the fields of IT sector, heavy machinery and health care. They also operate closely with research organisations and units in Korea.    VTT has an office in South Korea. The purpose of the office is to co-research with Korean public sector and research as a service for Korean clients. The office has been operating for six years with the current mode. Being present at the target market is important to VTT but more research needs to be done.    This thesis tries to answer a question about what is the most optimal foreign operation mode strategy for VTT and what is the best way to execute it. Korean R&D ecosystem is dynamic and changes rapidly which is the reason for the new internal approach.    The study helps VTT to develop their Korean operations but also giving their Finnish and Korean stakeholders more value. It helps to map out the key players in the Korean ecosystem and build VTT well-functioning and efficient operation mode strategy.    Goal is to improve co-operation with stakeholders so it would be more systematic and getting partners would be easier. Open and connected operation will help VTT to commit their counterparts to achieving common goals.    Research was conducted as a narrative operational research where interviews took place at the same space with the interviewees. Interviews were held in South Korea and participants who took part of the research were experts from different research organisations, intermediaries and companies operating in Korea. Keywords: foreign operation mode, contractual mode, mode switching, mode stretching, mode combination, South Korea.
