Bomp! : saving the world one record at a time
"Brian Case has taken live ammo to an Al Pacino interview, ingested horse tranquillizers with Ian Dury, reluctantly hit the road with the Sex Pistols ('Idiots!') and interviewed Miles Davis in a totally blacked-out room. He is a critically acclaimed novelist and journalist who has written for NME, The Times, Uncut and Time Out among many others. In a series of conversations, Brian offers vivid recollections of some of his most memorable encounters. On the Snap is a thrilling glimpse of a disappering after-midnight world, all delivered with the sharp, speedy insight of a great raconteur."

Basso Magazine is a music magazine published by the Helsinki-based media company Oy Basso Media Ltd. The magazine covers in its articles both domestic and foreign artists and bands in the field of urban music. In addition, the magazine also consists of articles about fashion and art. This thesis presents the research process and the results of a Basso Magazine reader survey. At the time of the research, the magazine had been published since 2006, with six issues per year. The thesis was commissioned in spring 2009. The aim of the reader survey was to find out subscribers' and single issue buyers' opinions on the content of the magazine. In addition, readers were asked to share their new ideas and improvement suggestions for the magazine's developmental purposes. The company had not previously implemented this type of reader survey. The reader survey was conducted as a web-based questionnaire in late spring 2009. It consisted of both structured and open questions. The questions were divided into different categories. The responses of the questionnaire were analyzed and based on the responses charts and figures were drawn up, forming the basis of the analysis chapter. The most frequent themes, which emerged from the open answers, were also analyzed in the same chapter. On the basis of the responses readers of the magazine were satisfied with the visual style and the layout of it. Feedback of the content was more critical, however. The readers wanted more clear structure and in-depth focus on the journalistic views of the articles. The research study showed that Basso Magazine has an active and conscious readership and they are willing to take part in the development of the magazine in the future.
