Youth cultures : a cross-cultural perspective
"Films without images is one of the last works of Blaise Cendrars, and has never been published in the English language prior to this translation. The book is composed of three historical radio plays, written in collaboration with Nino Frank. Gilles de Rais, Sarajevo, and Le Divin Arétin were performed between 1954 and 1956 and received considerable acclaim from the media as well as the audience of French National Television and Radio. Due to popular demand, they were rebroadcast several times, before being published as a collection by Éditions Denoël in 1959."--P. 7.
