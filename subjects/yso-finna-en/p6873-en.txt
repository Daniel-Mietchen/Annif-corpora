"Since the first edition was published in 1988, the role of crisis intervention and prevention has become central to mental health professionals working in the schools. Disasters such as hurricane Katrina, terrorist attacks both in this country and around the world, and various school shootings have greatly increased school crisis research and policy development. This book is designed for an introductory graduate course taken by students in school psychology, school counseling, and school social work. Section I provides a crisis response overview, section II deals with crises for children and adolescents and section III covers crises that manifest in adolescence. Discussions of the 16 most prevalent types of crises are covered in sections II and III and include their characteristics, causes, interventions, and preventive programs. All chapters will be updated, six heavily revised or totally rewritten by new authors, and two new chapters (chapters 8 & 19) have been added. "--

Building on the features which have been successful characteristics of the previous editions, this revision will retain the same underlying focus and conceptual structure, but will be modified to reflect changes in the discipline as well as insights based on feedback from students and faculty using the text. The central concept of "Approaches to Psychology" is reflected in the title: that psychology is a complex discipline based on a variety of approaches to understanding human behaviour. The rationale for this structure has been, and remains, that examining the origins and central concepts of the major approaches is an effective way of presenting an introduction to the field."Approaches to Psychology" offers a compact introductory text which presents the content in a readable, understandable way, based on a structure which is both distinguishable from other texts and already 'field-tested'. The same basic structure will be retained in the new edition. Essentially, this means an initial introductory chapter, chapters devoted to each of the five major approaches, and chapters which provide a comparative analysis of how the approaches can be applied to the same central issues (development, social behaviour, and abnormal behaviour). In addition, there will be a summary chapter, as well as an appendix which examines research methods and statistical analysis.
Psychology : from inquiry to understanding
This handbook addresses the educational uses of mindfulness in schools. It summarizes the state of the science and describes current and emerging applications and challenges throughout the field. It explores mindfulness concepts in scientific, theoretical, and practical terms and examines training opportunities both as an aspect of teachers' professional development and a means to enhance students' social-emotional and academic skills. Chapters discuss mindfulness and contemplative pedagogy programs that have produced positive student outcomes, including stress relief, self-care, and improved classroom and institutional engagement. Featured topics include: * A comprehensive view of mindfulness in the modern era. * Contemplative education and the roots of resilience. * Mindfulness practice and its effect on students' social-emotional learning. * A cognitive neuroscience perspective on mindfulness in education that addresses students' academic and social skills development. * Mindfulness training for teachers and administrators. * Two universal mindfulness education programs for elementary and middle school students. The Handbook of Mindfulness in Education is a must-have resource for researchers, graduate students, clinicians, and practitioners in psychology, psychiatry, education, and medicine, as well as counseling, social work, and rehabilitation therapy.
