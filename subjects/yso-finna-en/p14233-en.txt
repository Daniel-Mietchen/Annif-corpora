The objective of this thesis was to explore the mobility of students in Dalarna University and HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences. The main research question was how organizations and people reacted to the mobility issue, how they have done it, and what the present student mobility situation in HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences and Dalarna University is. Another aim was to find out the factors encouraging and preventing student exchange and to see what could be done in order to enhance the interest in exchange. The theoretical framework concentrates on organisational behaviour. The theory on barriers to trade enlightens how softer values may act as barriers for mobility even though the technical barriers have been removed. Strong organisational cultures and fear of change can be a burden when facing new situations and challenges, but the theory of resistance to change presents how these can be managed. In addition, the theory of rational decision-making demonstrates how to make decisions in order to optimise the desired outcome. The study was conducted by a qualitative research method. A few members of administrative staff and students were interviewed in both universities. These interviews were carried out both face-to-face and via e-mail. Data on student mobility in general in Sweden and Finland was gathered from different organisations and official institutions. Also the development of the Bologna process and its effects on educational organisations and thus mobility was studied. Although the empirical part of the thesis also includes researching overall student mobility in both countries, the findings and recommendations are limited to the aforementioned universities. The results show that there is cooperation between universities and mobility has been made easier, but HAAGA-HELIA students tend to study more abroad when compared to students from Dalarna. The reasons why Swedish students do not go abroad vary but are not altogether due to financial issues. More information on in-coming exchange students and students who have already been on exchange, comprehensive internet pages on exchange possibilities, and developed and smooth cooperation between universities and different organisations can be some methods that could make  students still hesitating more confident about exchange.
