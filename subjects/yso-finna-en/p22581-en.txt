"Sea and freshwater ports are a key component of U.S. critical infrastructure and are vital to maintaining the global and domestic economy. The September 11th attacks in the U.S. marked a paradigm shift in the security of transportation systems including the port and shipping industries. This has led to an increased emphasis on port security. This fully updated second edition covers the latest on continuously changing legislation regarding federal mandates, credentializing employees, securing vessels, and cargo security. The book focuses on best practices, providing real-world solutions to law enforcement authorities and security management professionals"--Provided by publisher.

This thesis concentrates on product development process improvement for machine control system development and its integration in the integrated management system of Metso Minerals Inc. The research problem was the practical difficulties in using the general product development process in control system development and unfamiliarity of special characteristics of software development within organization. The general product development process has been defined for machinery development and thus is not most suitable for control system development. For this very reason, there was an unofficial process model defined for software development. This model supports the function better and follows the general development framework. Objective of this thesis was to improve the model to match contemporary needs. The model was also supposed to incorporate a separate safety engineering process. Research process involved comprehensive literature review regarding to process development, software processes and quality management. Present condition of processes in use was concluded by studying the process model descriptions and related documentation together with the integrated manual. The second phase was to interview intercompany professionals from a number of departments, such as automation engineering, mechanical engineering, project management office and process support departments. Additionally a development process of another business unit was benchmarked to gather their best practices into the new model. The maturity of formerly used process model for control system development was assessed based on one sub-process. Assessment was conducted according to standardized assessment model. This enabled to find comparable references from other researches. New process model was developed based on findings in research phase which now to supports control system development better. New model incorporates safety engineering process and engineering change process for control systems. It suits now all development activities within organization and provides more comprehensive guidance for projects managers. Another improvement relates to project management and risk reduction in planning phase. This provides more comprehensive plans for decision making. Finally this thesis defines a method for how to integrate and link the new model to general development process and integrated manual.

The aim of study was to investigate the petroleum companies in Iran and research the prospects, current security issues and some operational suggestions for Abloy Oy in the focused market. The qualitative method was utilized to obtain first-hand and in-depth primary information through online interviews and phone calls. The results showed that national Iranian oil companies are the main actors in the market while using mostly human based security personnel and not much of automatized systems, thus creating an opportunity for Abloy Oy to expand and develop its market share. However, the complicated culture of the public sector in Iran could create some barrier to cooperation, making it essential for Abloy Oy to use the assistance of a local, competent, and experienced agent to make this potential and profitable market accessible.
