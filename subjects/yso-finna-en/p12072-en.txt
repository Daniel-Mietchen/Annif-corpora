The book represents an attempt to further bridges between mainstream theory on representation, and gender and politics theory, while offering a significant amount of empirical evidence. It links political input and output by tackling the democratic process from three different angles: (1) the mechanisms to access the representative institutions, (2) how do the representatives perform once they are elected, and (3) how well the MP's opinions match the voters' opinions, or how well does the 'electoral connection' function in substantive terms.

"Why do some Members of Parliament (MPs) take the parliamentary floor and speak more than others? Why do some MPs deviate more than others from the ideological position of their party? This book develops hypotheses on legislative speechmaking and evaluates them by analysing parliamentary debates in seven European democracies: Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. Assuming that MPs are concerned with policy-making, career advancement, and re-election, the authors discuss various incentives to taking the floor, and elaborate on the role of gender and psychological incentives in speechmaking. They test their expectations on a novel dataset that covers information on the number of speeches held by MPs and on the ideological positions MPs adopted when delivering a speech. "--
