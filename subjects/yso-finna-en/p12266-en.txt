"This important resource bridges the gap between imaging, optics, and photonics, and statistics and data analysis. The text contains a wide range of relevant statistical methods including a review of the fundamentals of statistics and expanding into multivariate techniques. The techniques are explained in the context of real examples from remote sensing, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, signal processing, color science, and other related disciplines. The book also emphasizes intuitive and geometric understanding of concepts. The topics that are most relevant to imaging, optics, and photonics applications are covered thoroughly. In addition, supplemental topics are discussed to provide an overview of when and how the methods can be used".

This book is devoted to the application of advanced signal processing on event-related potentials (ERPs) in the context of electroencephalography (EEG) for the cognitive neuroscience. ERPs are usually produced through averaging single-trials of preprocessed EEG, and then, the interpretation of underlying brain activities is based on the ordinarily averaged EEG. We find that randomly fluctuating activities and artifacts can still present in the averaged EEG data, and that constant brain activities over single trials can overlap with each other in time, frequency and spatial domains. Therefore, before interpretation, it will be beneficial to further separate the averaged EEG into individual brain activities. The book proposes systematic approaches pre-process wavelet transform (WT), independent component analysis (ICA), and nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) to filter averaged EEG in time, frequency and space domains to sequentially and simultaneously obtain the pure ERP of interest. Software of the proposed approaches will be open-accessed.
Contemporary Communication Systems provides a comprehensive introduction to analog and digital communication systems. In addition to a logical and easy-to-understand presentation of fundamental principles, the book engages students in the issues relevant to system and product implementation by integrating a discussion of theoretical concepts with extensive hands-on visual and simulation resources that reinforce learning. A unique feature of the book is sufficient coverage of important topics in digital communications including compression, multiplexing and synchronization techniques. The book also explores the impact of semiconductor revolution (Moore's law) and software technologies in the realization of modern digital communication systems. -- Publisher.

"Spectral Audio Signal Processing is the fourth book in the music signal processing series by Julius O. Smith. One can say that human hearing occurs in terms of spectral models. As a result, spectral models are especially useful in audio applications. For example, with the right spectral model, one can discard most of the information contained in a sound waveform without changing how it sounds. This is the basis of modern audio compression techniques."--Publisher's description.

"Master the basic concepts and methodologies of digital signal processing with this systematic introduction, without the need for an extensive mathematical background. The authors lead the reader through the fundamental mathematical principles underlying the operation of key signal processing techniques, providing simple arguments and cases rather than detailed general proofs. Coverage of practical implementation, discussion of the limitations of particular methods and plentiful MATLAB illustrations allow readers to better connect theory and practice. A focus on algorithms that are of theoretical importance or useful in real-world applications ensures that students cover material relevant to engineering practice, and equips students and practitioners alike with the basic principles necessary to apply DSP techniques to a variety of applications. Chapters include worked examples, problems and computer experiments, helping students to absorb the material they have just read. Lecture slides for all figures and solutions to the numerous problems are available to instructors"--Provided by publisher.
