"A fabulous resource for graduate advisors" Eric Mazur, Harvard University Successful Research Supervision offers a research-based practical framework for academics to be able to examine and further develop their effectiveness as research supervisors. Research supervisors working in all levels of higher education must ensure that their students gain efficiencies from working as part of an effective cohort and develop high levels of interdisciplinary understanding and critical thought. To impart these disciplines effectively is essential for any successful research supervisor. From helping researchers to begin to managing a project through to successful completion, this book guides the reader through a series of exercises to identify their individual strengths and weaknesses and then provides theoretically sound advice in a practical and easy to use format. Successful Research Supervision is full of examples of the best practice from outstanding scientists, social scientists and humanities supervisors from both the UK and the USA. This book will encourage and help academics to: - Expand their own repertoire and array of actions and responses, thus giving them the flexibility to meet different situations with ease and confidence - Identify the optimum combination of approaches to best fit individual students - Understand the influence of their own value and experiences in the choice of their approach to research students - Be able to choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for a particular curriculum or project - Employ a neutral language for developing and assisting others"--

"A comprehensive assessment system for working with underperforming students This book describes a comprehensive assessment system especially appropriate for multilingual and "differentiated" classrooms with large numbers of underperforming students. Drawing from Multiple Intelligences theory, the approach is specifically aimed at helping teachers understand how each student learns and how best to tailor instruction to serve individual students' needs. Although the program makes use of conventional standardized tests and disability screenings, it places special importance on two approaches in particular: Student Portfolio Assessments and Personalized Learning Profiles. Provides detailed guidance and practical tools (including a DVD) for implementing successful portfolio and "profile" practices in the classroom. Includes real-world examples of model assessment programs from five schools. Explains how to integrate assessment into the instructional process as well as how the portfolio program can be used. Formal profiles provide vital information about each student's cultural background, interests, strengths, and capabilities as well as their individual learning and language needs."--

"The landscape of higher education has dramatically altered in the past 30 years as more students are attending universities and colleges than ever before. In such a competitive market, the quality of the student experience is pivotal to an institution's ability to attract students. However, the increasing costs of delivering HE teamed with a reduction in government funding means that creating a high standard of student experience has never been more challenging. The Student Experience 'Practitioner Model' discussed in this book recognises the need of staff at all levels who are developing and implementing initiatives to improve and enhance the student experience. It provides an organised and detailed structure that can be orchestrated in a cost effective and highly adaptable manner. It guides Practitioners in the identification of what they must deliver, who it is delivered to and when they need to deliver by working through the six key stages of the new student lifecycle: - First Contact and Admissions; - Pre-arrival; - Arrival and Orientation; - Induction to Study; - Reorientation and Reinduction (Returners Induction) - Outduction (preparation for life after undergraduate study). -- Provided by publisher.
