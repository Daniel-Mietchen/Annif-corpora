Preparing a functional test specification for the BCU control unit used in ABB frequency converters
"Since publication of the second edition, there have been extensive changes in the algorithms, methods, and assumptions in energy management systems that analyze and control power generation. This edition is updated to acquaint electrical engineering students and professionals with current power generation systems. Algorithms and methods for solving integrated economic, network, and generating system analysis are provided. Also included are the state-of-the-art topics undergoing evolutionary change, including market simulation, multiple market analysis, multiple interchange contract analysis, contract and market bidding, and asset valuation under various portfolio combinations"--
Power generation, operation, and control
"Along with the standard topics of power electronics and electromechanical conversion, this popular text covers energy resources, power plants, environmental impacts of power generation, power system operation, renewable energy, and electrical safety. Focusing on issues encountered daily in practice, the author includes examples based on real systems and data. Now in color, this third edition offers new and expanded coverage on the failure modes of nuclear power plants, interface and integration issues, stray voltage and impulse shocks, the circuits in wind and solar systems, and smart grid technology"--
