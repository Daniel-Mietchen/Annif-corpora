Isla's got the designer clothes and dream job as head stylist at the most exclusive salon in Edinburgh. The fact that she's been so single-minded in this quest that she's forgotten to have a life, a relationship, or any proper friendships, has passed her by. When it all goes horribly wrong, there's nobody willing to support her in her hour of need. Finn is thirty-five and reality has just hit him hard. Now his best friends are about to have a baby and everything is changing. When into his life walks Isla.
