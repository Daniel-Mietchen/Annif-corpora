Telecommunication solutions for secondary substation automation
This thesis focuses on studying the available methods and technology for creating communication networks to fulfill the secondary substation automation needs. The communication techniques are presented individually while keeping the approach strictly limited to the facts and characteristics most relevant for secondary substation communication design. The communication methods are then compared and viewed from different perspectives. The comparison between the communication methods is conducted according to the three main criteria: reliability, security and cost-efficiency. The information is then reviewed alongside with customer extracted information in order to acquire a broader view on the current communication networks and their future aspects. The results of this study give a general view on possible communications methods for secondary substation communications and depict the growing need for effective communication methods in modern electricity grids.
