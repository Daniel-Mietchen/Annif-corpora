This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the various 'villa' sites in the region of Rome in order to differentiate the various intentions that lay behind their construction over time. This includes an analysis of the coastal villas near Ostia, the estates in the Alban Hills, the socio-political function of Imperial residences and how each site can be used to understand the social climate of the hinterland beyond the capital up until the end of the 2nd Century AD, but there have also been some examples taken from a 3rd Century context as well, which have been used on a largely comparative basis. The main focus remains the development of villas around the capital into the first two centuries of the Roman principate. The author analyses the chief characteristics of the layout of central Italian villas of the élite, using specific case studies of villas that have been excavated and/or recorded outside the city of Rome. This analysis aims to uncover correlations between the literary definition of "suburbia", the identification of villas as 'suburban' - as opposed to rural or maritime.

The New Suburban History rejects the popular image of suburbs as conformist and conflict-free havens, revealing that their seemingly calm streets have long been battlegrounds over race, class, and politics. With this collection, Kevin Kruse and Thomas Sugrue argue that suburbia must be understood as a central factor in the modern American experience. Kruse and Sugrue here collect ten essays - augmented by their provocative introduction - that recast important political and social issues in the context of suburbanization. Drawing from original research on locales across the country, the contributors reveal the role suburbs have played in the transformation of American liberalism and conservatism; debates about the environment, land use, and taxation; and the contentious politics of race, class, and ethnicity. These innovative observers ultimately show that the emergence of a suburban America has reshaped national politics, fostered new social movements, and remade the country's landscape. The New Suburban History offers nothing less than a new American history - one that claims the nation cannot be fully understood without a history of American suburbs at its very center.
Tupperware, television, bungalows and respectable front lawns. Always instantly recognisable though never entirely familiar. The tight semi-detached estates of thirties Britain and the infenced and functional tract housing of middle America. The elegant villas of Victorian London and the clapboard and brick of fifties Sydney. Architecture and landscapes may vary from one suburban scene to another, but the suburb is the embodiment of the same desire; to create for middle class middle cultures, middle spaces in middle America, Britain and Australia. Visions of Suburbia considers this emergent architectural space, this set of values and this way of life. The contributors address suburbia and the suburban from the point of view of its production, its consumption and its representation. Placing suburbia centre stage, each essay examines what it is that makes suburbia so distinctive and what it is that has made suburbia so central to contemporary culture.
