This long-awaited new edition helps students understand and solve the complex problems that organic chemists regularly face, using a step-by-step method and approachable text. With solved and worked-through problems, the author orients discussion of each through the application of various problem-solving techniques. Teaches organic chemists structured and logical techniques to solve reaction problems and uses a unique, systematic approach. Stresses the logic and strategy of mechanistic problem solving -- a key piece of success for organic chemistry, beyond just specific reactions and facts Has a conversational tone and acts as a readable and approachable workbook allowing reader involvement instead of simply straightforward text Uses 60 solved and worked-through problems and reaction schemes for students to practice with, along with updated organic reactions and illustrated examples Includes website with supplementary material for chapters and problems: http://tapsoc.yolasite.com.
Peter Atkins explains the processes involved in chemical reactions. He begins by introducing a tool kit of basic reactions, such as precipitation, corrosion and catalysis, and concludes by showing how these building blocks are brought together in complex processes.
