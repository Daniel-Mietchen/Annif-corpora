sedimentology
Earth surface processes, landforms and sediment deposits
Sedimentology and sedimentary basins : from turbulence to tectonics
Abstract: Field methods by means of which fluvial transportation load can be measured in different circumstances are described. The lower course of the Hevojoki river and the alluvial fan formed in its mouth in the valley of Utsjoki in Lapland are regarded as example areas...
