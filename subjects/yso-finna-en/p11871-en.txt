Investigations done at an old sawmill site found high levels of PCDD/F (Dioxin) contamination. As the area has been allocated as a residential development, remediation of the site has been started, which involves the excavation of contaminated soil and transporting it to landfill sites. The purpose of this work is to clarify the concept of dioxin contamination in soil and review different remediation techniques available for dioxin contaminated soil. A-Insinöörit requested a study that would assist the company in making decisions that will provide their customers with the best possible options in this regard. The study was based on a number of different researches done in Finland and Internationally on dioxin contamination and the different remediation techniques currently in use or in development. While landfilling is the most common and economical remediation solution in currently in use, Mecanochemical treatment was identified as the treatment with the most potential for the future and it's development needs to be followed closely. Landfilling is still the best option for the company at this time, but the fact that the soil contamination is just relocated and still present in landfills, means that a permanent treatment will still be required to eliminate the dangers associated with dioxin toxicity in future.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are ubiquitous and bioaccumulative man-made chemicals, resistant to chemical, biological and photolytic degradation and widely distributed to sediments, wildlife, and human. Many of these chemicals have adverse effects on a variety of targets, including the endocrine system, organogenesis and reproduction. Due to these effects and wide distribution, many of them are either banned or strictly controlled. However, because of persistency, they continue to interact with organisms globally.Despite the existing knowledge of the adverse effects of POPs, the effects of many chemicals on bone tissue are still poorly known. In the present study, we investigated the adverse effects of three common POPs, including tributyltin (TBT), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on the skeletal system. In vitro models were used to study the effects of PFOA in mouse and in human, and the co-effects of TBT and TCDD on differentiating osteoblasts and osteoclasts of mice. An in vivo model for mice was used to study the developmental effects of maternal PFOA-exposure on pups among with morphometrical and biomechanical property analyses. Mass-spectrometry was used to study the presence of PFOA in bones both in mice and in human, the latter acquired from the bone bank held in the Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The bones were also analyzed with cone beam computer tomography and microcomputer tomography.The results show that PFOA exposure in utero and during lactation leads to the accumulation of PFOA in bone, traceable even 17 months after exposure. PFOA exposure decreased the mineral density of the tibias and increased the medullary area. Nearly all of the human samples contained PFAS, including PFOA. PFOA also disturbed the differentiation of osteoblasts and with lower doses, increased bone resorption of osteoclasts both in mouse and human, the phenomenon being slightly stronger in mice. Co-exposure to TBT and TCDD led to decreased differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclast, and the co-effect was partially synergistic in osteoblasts.These results show disruption of bone development, bone cell differentiation, and PFAS accumulation in bone. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the co-effects of different POPs and the possible effects of long-term accumulation of POPs in bone and other tissues.
