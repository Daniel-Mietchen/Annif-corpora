Out/In the Cold : Documents on the cooperation between ICA/Moscow and Valand School of Fine Arts in the field of contemporary art
Vysoká Škola Uměleckoprůmyslová v Praze : 1885 - 2005 = Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague : 1885 - 2005
Since 1960, progressive forces within art education have stoked, and continued to fire, new impulses in the field of artistic production. As society at large embraced youth and popular culture, art school students with international aspirations exploded class barriers, fused fashion with Pop and insisted that art was integral to social change. These possibilities were unthinkable without shifts in priorities. Replacing a craft-based curriculum, the teaching in art schools across Britain, and notably in London, began to widen the range of artistic exploration. A new generation emerged, whose techniques, perspectives, and arguments had their origins in these innovations and whose most striking forms of expression maintain their influence on the most adventurous artists in the new millennium. This history of innovation has been largely unwritten. Here, scholars in the field explore key aspects of this dynamic period such as changes in architecture, exhibition display and approaches to art history. With 100 illustrations showing both the art school in action and the works that were made under its pull, this survey also provides key information for the London Art Schools - Camberwell, Chelsea, Wimbledon, Slade, Royal College of Art, Goldsmiths and Central St Martins.
Kanagawa is a strategic and poetic card game in which you must paint the most beautiful print. Improve your studio to immortalise the most beautiful subjects through the seasons and become the most prestigious student of the painter Hokusai.

This Reader came out of the material chosen by Simryn Gill for the young artists participating in her Master Class in the summer of 2011 at the Saari Manor in Southern Finland. In its printed book format, the Reader is a way of sharing the inspiration these texts, written by very differnt authors, give to think about art, the how and why of making art, with a community of readers.
