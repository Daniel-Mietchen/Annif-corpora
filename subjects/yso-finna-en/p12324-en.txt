Yaya's Story is the story of Yaya Harouna and Paul Stoller, two men whose lives couldn't be more different. But when they are both threatened by grave illness - cancer - those differences evaporate, and the two are brought to profound existential convergence, a deep camaraderie in the face of the most harrowing circumstances. Yaya's Story is that story, a story of difference and unity, of illness and health, a lyrical reflection on human resiliency and the shoulders we lean on.

Ocasião : the marquis and the anthropologist, a collaboration
"After the Ancestors The passage from pagan to Christian and tribesman to citizen has been exhaustively documented, but the people who make up that story have mostly been written out of it. This account, set in Nias, Indonesia, captures the human dilemmas attending the world- historical transformation from tribalism to modernity. The author allows the complexity of the issues - the hold of the past on the present, perspectives on life and death, vengeance and morality - to emerge through dramatic encounters. Innovative and personally challenging, this book is about a radically different world and the search for a common humanity that underlies cultural difference. It is also about the process of coming to understand another society and the formation of an anthropologist. Interweaving a gripping narrative of fieldwork with the drama of life in a tribal society in extremis, this book is essential reading for students of anthropology and the general reader alike"--

"In the West at the turn of the twentieth century, public understanding of science and the world was shaped in part by expeditions to Asia, North America, and the Pacific. The Anthropology of Expeditions draws together contributions from anthropologists and historians of science to explore the role of these journeys in natural history and anthropology between approximately 1890 and 1930. By examining collected materials as well as museum and archive records, the contributors to this volume shed light on the complex social life and intimate work practices of the researchers involved in these expeditions. At the same time, the contributors also demonstrate the methodological challenges and rewards of studying these legacies and provide new insights for the history of collecting, history of anthropology, and histories of expeditions. Offering fascinating insights into the nature of expeditions and the human relationships that shaped them, The Anthropology of Expeditions sets a new standard for the field. "--

Abstract: Key Performance Indicators for Field Service. The purpose of this study was to design metrics to measure the effectiveness of field service in the ABB Finland's Drives Service division.     The need for this graduate study arises from lack of utilization of field service reports that are stored in ABB's drives database called Drives Installed Base (DIB). The data stored in the Drives Installed Base can be used to devise metrics called Key Performance Indicators to track and improve field service maintenance efficiency. The principal stakeholder for this study is the ABB Finland Drives Service.     In order to come up with a functioning system a continuous process to improve maintenance quality was devised along with the KPIs needed for its implementation.     The scope of this study is limited to the proposal of the KPIs and therefore does not include in any way what platform or software is used in their implementation.     The proposed KPIs provide a targeted approach into analysing maintenance performance in a way that is specific and quantifiable. This provides the basis for future development.
Histories in the field
"How are ethnographic knowledge and anthropological theory created out of field experiences? Working in the Field explores emplacement and experience-centered narratives as the modes in working in places brings anthropology to life. Stewart and Strathern show how first impressions of an area carry depths of meanings which can gradually be unpacked in later analysis and how the fieldworker's memories may become blended with those of the people studied as a result of long-term engagement with them. Spanning Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and Scotland, and Ireland, Stewart and Strathern show how fieldwork in apparently different areas can lead to unexpected comparisons and discoveries of similarities in human cross-cultural patterns of behavior"--
"Anthropology and anthropologists provides an entertaining and provocative account of British social anthropology from the foundations of the discipline, through the glory years of the mid-twentieth century and on to the transformation in recent decades. The book shocked the anthropological establishment on first publication in 1973 but soon established itself as one of the introductions for students of anthropology. Forty years later, this now classic work has been radically revised. Adam Kuper situates the leading actors in their historical and institutional context, probes their rivalries, revisits their debates, and reviews their key ethnographies. Drawing on recent scholarship he shows how the discipline was shaped by the colonial setting and by developments in the social sciences"--

Critical approaches to fieldwork : contemporary and historical archaeological practice
This manual provides a unique 'user guide' to practicing archaeology and working in the cultural heritage sector within the diverse settings of Great Britain, comprising of: England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. As part of their training, archaeologists often seek work in parts of Britain, either for experience before travelling elsewhere, or directly as part of their career progression. While this does involve reading published material on excavation techniques, archaeological theory, and specific heritage management practices, or research using the Internet, the ideal preparation to working in Britain for the first time requires practitioners to know a little about a lot.

Archaeology has progressed enormously since the early excavations of classical sites such as Olympia and Ephesus in the middle of the 19th century. A better perspective on the material culture of the classical world is now given by new methods and modern techniques, which depend on the rigorous application of skills from a wide range of disciplines. This book, written by a group of active field archaeologists, is designed particularly for students at A-level and on university courses, as well as for those with a general interest in the ancient world. It demonstrates the progression of a project from planing and prospection, through excavation and study to interpretation and public presentation. It also provides links to a wide range of internet resources to enable students to follow through case studies of recent survey and excavation ranging in time from the Bronze Age to the early Byzantine, and in extent from Britain to Turkey.
Clinical practice with individuals
"Early Korea is dedicated to developing the fields of early Korean history and archaeology in the English language. The present volume consists of six scholarly works by specialists active in these fields. Three studies focus on the topic of recent advances in historical archaeology on the Korean peninsula and adjacent regions and how this is changing the ways historians understand the history of the earliest states on the peninsula. Another study surveys the origins and development of ceramic traditions in Korea based on recently recovered archaeological data. Finally, two studies discuss the practice of heritage management in Korea, focusing on rescue archaeology and heritage protection."--BOOK JACKET.
