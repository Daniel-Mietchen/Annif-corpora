The objective of the thesis was to help SRAL in finding out their brand image: the way the members view the league, finding their likes and dislikes. In addition, the organization's brand identity was to be researched by examining the board's and personnel's view of the organization. The theoretical framework was based on David A. Aaker's brand identity model, Jesper Kunde's Corporate Religion theory and Uche Nworah's brand image matrix. These three theories were combined and integrated into the Total brand model. The study was conducted in the form of an online questionnaire, to which a link was placed on the SRAL web pages, SRAL's Facebook profile, and on emails sent to the members, employees and the board. The overall form of the research methodology was quantitative with a few qualitative questions integrated within. The findings revealed that both the organization members at SRAL as well as the members were quite content with the visual aspects of the brand such as the logo and the web pages. Both of the respondent groups were on the same lines with SRAL's brand personality, functional benefits as well as self-expressive benefits. The most problems seemed to lie on the areas of organizational culture and emotional benefits. Communication, both between SRAL and the employees, as well as SRAL and the members, was discovered not to be sufficient in quantity and quality. The employees were not too familiar with SRAL's values and visions, and neither did they know whether they should do things a certain way, the SRAL way. The members did not feel informed and they also felt that key issues were kept secret from them. In conclusion, SRAL is to work on both internal as well as external communication. The organization needs to create a SRAL culture and make the employees aware of what exactly the organization is about, what its values and visions are, how things are done at SRAL. In addition, SRAL has to work on gaining back the trust of its members. The processes and decision-making have to be made transparent. The members also need to feel that they are heard by the organization.
