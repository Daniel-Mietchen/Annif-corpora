"This useful book focuses on the skills that are absolutely central and essential to all mental health nursing, from basic communication skills to specific interventions and approaches". (Dr Neil Brimblecombe, Director of Nursing/Chief Operating Officer, South Staffordshire & Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust). "This is a fantastic book, absolutely packed with just about everything a mental health nurse needs to know about communication skills! The succinctly written chapters cover a wide range of key communications skills and each provides clear explanations, examples from 'everyday' life and clinical practice, with opportunities to reflect on your own experiences. Highly recommended". (Alan Simpson, Professor of Collaborative Mental Health Nursing, City University London, UK). This practical book provides a comprehensive guide to communication in mental health nursing, with an emphasis on demonstrating the use of different skills in various clinical settings. Written by experienced mental health professionals, the book is richly illustrated with a range of clinical case examples that will be recognisable to all nurses. Centred on the communication process as a whole, the topics are carefully presented through the use of patient-nurse dialogues and exchanges which bring the subject to life. This will help you to: develop essential communication skills; communicate confidently; use phatic communication effectively; use self-reflection in your practice; develop the ability to deal with conflict; develop empathic helping relationships; and, draw upon various therapeutic models of communication. "Communication Skills for Mental Health Nurses" is ideal for all nurses and healthcare professionals seeking to improve the skills required to communicate confidently and effectively with patients, their carers and other key people involved within the care environment.
