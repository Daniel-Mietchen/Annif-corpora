In The story of post-modernism, Charles Jencks, the authority on post-modern architecture and culture, provides the defining account of post-modern architecture from its earliest roots in the early 60s to the present day. By breaking the narrative into seven distinct chapters, which are both chronological and overlapping, Jencks charts the ebb and flow of the movement, the peaks and troughs of different ideas and themes.

The "postmodern turn" in the social sciences
"The Holocaust is often said to be unrepresentable. Yet since the 1990s, a new generation of Jewish American writers have been returning to this history again and again, insisting on engaging with it in highly playful, comic, and "impious" ways. Focusing on the fiction of Michael Chabon, Jonathan Safran Foer, Nicole Krauss, and Nathan Englander, this book suggests that this literature cannot simply be dismissed as insensitive or improper. It argues that these Jewish American authors engage with the Holocaust in ways that renew and ensure its significance for contemporary generations. These ways, moreover, are intricately connected to efforts of finding new means of expressing Jewish American identity, and of moving beyond the increasingly apparent problems of postmodernism"--

The relationship of social structure to individual and collective agency has been central to sociology from the outset. It remains so in period in which poststructuralists have challenged the idea of stable social structures and even the usefulness in social science of the concept of structure itself. The historical trajectory of the debate about the respective importance of structure and agency and the relationship between the two provides the narrative context of this collection of articles. The point of arranging this collection of articles predominantly in historical sequence is not simply a matter of convenience. Historical context has a major impact on forming the concerns of sociologists and, equally significantly, on the way they perceive and theorise the social world. It includes: Volume One: Modernity, Sociology and the Structure/Agency Debate ; Volume Two: Postmodernity - An End to the Structure /Agency Dichotomy? ; Volume Three: Structure/Agency Theories Applied ; and, Volume Four: Network Theory - Transcending the Traditional Limits of Structure/Agency .

Crossing the postmoderm divide
"Postmodernism is a term that has been used extensively to describe general trends and specific works in many different cultural contexts. ... This introduction clarifies the term and explores its relevance for music through discussion of specific musical examples from the 1950s to the present day, providing an engagement between theory and practice. ... It outlines and addresses the problems of defining what we mean by postmodernism, explores when postmodernism begins, engages with a broad range of literature and reference sources, inviting wider reading and thinking, and uses specific musical examples to present ways of interpreting music that can be defined as postmodernist."--From publisher description.
A wooden horse in the archaeological site of Troy, Plastic 'Greek' statues on the seabed, resin columns at the Roman Forum, painted copies of Altamira and Lescaux grottos, Tutankhamun's tomb in a casino of Las Vegas, fake Roman fortresses with legionnaires and gladiators, 'Etruscan' vases in a hotel in Milan, Valentino's creations on display in a Roman monument, voyeuristic attractions at Pompeii, ancient and new thermal baths with Roman-style treatments, 'real' Roman wines produced in archaeological sites, and shows, plays of light, cocktails and fashion parades, a lottery for spending winter solstice at Newgrange...Museums and archaeological areas host all the contradictions of late modern society. Consumerism, media, advertising and virtual reality transform the relationships between archaeology, tourism, collective imagery and political identity. We are witnesses to the success of archistar museums, 'event' exhibitions, sensorial and virtual tourism, archaeotrekking and archaeodiving, even tourism of the non-existent. Authenticity itself takes on a different meaning when finds and monuments are not original or are exhibited in theme parks, hotels or subway stations. This book is an innovative, critical and stimulating appraisal of the situation.

Postmodern theory : critical interrogations
This anthology generated great interest on its publication in 1994, bringing together experimental poets and movements from 1950 to the present in one groundbreaking volume. Now, two decades later, Paul Hoover has revised and updated it for twenty-first century readers. His revised introduction argues that new technologies have given postmodern poets a fresh field of play for longstanding practices such as "harvesting" and playing with "found text." The updated contents feature 114 poets, 583 poems, and selections from 19 poetics essays. Representing the full historical sweep--from the Beat movement, the New York School, and the language movements to 21st-century developments like cyberpoetry and Flarf, this anthology makes "the avant-garde accessible" (Chicago Tribune) for a new generation of readers.--From publisher description.
