number of nodes, versus quadratic for common techniques. SBS algorithm is analyzed through simulations, showing equal performance compared to the state of the art at significantly lower complexity in communication. After estimating pairwise distances, a localization algorithm, based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), is applied on range data in order to find node positions. Localization algorithm estimates the relative locations of network nodes with respect to some other nodes or their absolute locations in a global coordinate system. Different centralized and distributed localization algorithms are studied and their performances are compared in simulation examples.
