multi-channel system
A holistic approach for a visionary map-based multi-channel service
"This important resource bridges the gap between imaging, optics, and photonics, and statistics and data analysis. The text contains a wide range of relevant statistical methods including a review of the fundamentals of statistics and expanding into multivariate techniques. The techniques are explained in the context of real examples from remote sensing, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, signal processing, color science, and other related disciplines. The book also emphasizes intuitive and geometric understanding of concepts. The topics that are most relevant to imaging, optics, and photonics applications are covered thoroughly. In addition, supplemental topics are discussed to provide an overview of when and how the methods can be used".
Development suggestions for improving customer experience in the case company : case: OP Liminka
Today, competitive advantage cannot be gained through improving the products or lowering the prices. Advantage over the competitors must be searched from new sources, for example by focusing on customer experience. In addition the value created in the past, can be important when the customer is making the purchasing decision in the future. The changes in the consumer's wants and needs are driving companies to make changes in their business strategy. Concept of customer experience refers to finding out the needs of the customer; in order to gain competitive advantage. In addition, focusing on negative impressions is important, as people tend to share their experiences to their friends and family  this makes customer experience a marketing tool. Focusing on different aspects of customer experience is important, as customers should be the core of the business  without the customers there is no need for the company. Companies should focus on developing customer experience in order to make the customer do transactions in the future as well. The topic for this bachelor's thesis was given by the case company; Limingan Osuuspankki. During my internship, the case company wanted to conduct a research focusing on customer experience as the case company wanted to focus on develop in creating experiences for the customers. As the case company had no previous experience on the topic, the goal of this research was to find out what kind of customer experience does the customers of the case company have and to find suggestions for developing it. This study focused on different aspects of customer experience, for example - how it is created and how it can be measured. All in all, developing customer experience is dependent on many different factors. Different tools for measuring customer experience, give only one viewpoint into phenomena. ^

The goal of this thesis was to investigate and build new circuit solutions for electrophysiological measurements that would be used in biophysical research of nervous system and brain activity. The first aim was to build a micromotion compensation system that could compensate for the relative movement of measurement microelectrodes and neurons that can cause signal attenuation or even loss. The purpose of this work was to stabilize the microelectrode with respect to the preparation in order to achieve more stable measurements with small test animals, such as insects, rodents or reptiles. The movement is measured with a touch probe sensor and a feedback loop containing a piezoelectric actuator that adjusts the position of the electrode. A prototype micromotion compensation system was built and its performance was measured in a realistic measurement condition. The compensation system was used to reduce the motion of the probe to below 1 µm, resulting in up to 98% compensation below 10 Hz. The design of the micromotion compensation system took advantage of a preceding study on a piezoelectric bimorph actuator/sensor structure. This study is also presented in the thesis.Another aim of the research was to design and build an integrated multichannel neural signal recording system with stimulation capabilities. The circuit was designed to amplify, digitize and stream out data from extracellular neuronal signal measurements. The main target of the measurement system are action potential signals, which are a type of “digital communication” between nerve cells that evolution has produced. The waveform of these action potential signals is the focus of interest. To accomplish this measurement, the developed circuit contains preamplification, multiplexing, post-amplification, A/D conversion and control logic for the A/D converter and data transmission. The circuit is also externa lly programmable, and it contains DACs for tuning high-pass filter corner frequency, amplifier bias current and stimulation current.The implemented electronics have low noise, low power and small circuit area. The gain of the circuit is adjustable from 100 to 5000 and the high-pass filter corner frequency from 0.5 Hz to 900 Hz. The sample rate is 20.833 kSps and the data rate is 3.5 Mbps. The measured noise level of the circuit is 7.5μV (rms) (300 Hz - 10 kHz) and the whole chip consumes less than 2 mW of power. A 16-channel prototype chip with 0.35μm CMOS technology was manufactured and its performance was measured. Backend electronics containing a microcontroller supporting high-speed USB data transfer was also programmed for the system. The device was tested in real measurements of neuronal signals in a cockroach (Periplaneta americana) preparation, and reliable streaming of the recorded data to the PC verified its proper function.
With dramatic changes in consumer behaviour - from online shopping to the influence of social media - marketers are finding it harder than ever to coordinate, prioritize and integrate the latest interactive channels into their overall brand-building strategy. Despite hard evidence showing the importance of digital marketing, the emphasis often remains on traditional media, with the most common social media channels being used without centralized coordination or integration with a wider marketing and branding campaign. Multi-Channel Marketing Ecosystems examines a fundamental game changer for th.

These conditions put pressure for the business managers as they should set goals for improving customer experience. Measuring without any goal is just a waste of resources. Theoretical background was gathered during the autumn 2015, as customer experience is widely researched topic, the problem was to choose the most beneficial data. The empirical part of this study was conducted by using different qualitative methods, such as theme interviews conducted for the customers and for the employees of the case company. In addition, NPS survey conducted by a third party was included in the research process. The collected data was analyzed and compared with the findings from the theory. Different research methods gave an opportunity for finding relevant data and also a chance to see the reasons behind different factors and results. Due to confidential data, results from the NPS questionnaire are marked as confidential.
