The theme of this conference is the role of computation in the consideration of performance in planning and design. Since long, a building no longer simply serves to shelter human activity from the natural environment. It must not just defy natural forces, carry its own weight, its occupants and their possessions, it should also functionally facilitate its occupants' activities, be esthetically pleasing, be economical in building and maintenance costs, provide temperature, humidity, lighting and acoustical comfort, be sustainable with respect to material, energy and other resources, and so forth. Considering all these performance aspects in building design is far from straightforward and their integration into the design process further increases complexity, interdisciplinarity and the need for computational support. One of the roles of computation in planning and design is the measurement and prediction of the performances of buildings and cities, where performance denotes the ability of this built environment to meet various technical and non-technical requirements (physical as well as psychological) placed upon them by owners, users and society at large.

All quests for data integration in architecture and the construction industry lead ultimately to FUSION, a synthesis of knowledge that transcends mere combination. FUSION is the dream of a knowledge system that will enable multiple sets of data, in manifold formats, to be presented in a unified view. The conference theme is Fusion: Data integration at its best. The conference will explore the possibilities for advanced levels of data integration in the service of the representation and management of the natural environment, and the design, visualisation and making of the built environment.

Fabricate : making digital architecture
"In an era of increasingly available digital resources, many textile designers and makers find themselves at an interesting juncture between traditional craft process and newer digital technologies. Highly specialized craft/design practitioners may now elect to make use of digital processes in their work, but often choose not to abandon craft skills fundamental to their practice, and aim to balance the complex connection between craft and digital processes. The essays collected here consider this transition from the viewpoint of aesthetic opportunity arising in the textile designer's hands-on experimentation with material and digital technologies available in the present.Craft provides the foundations for thinking within the design and production of textiles, and as such may provide some clues in the transition to creative and thoughtful use of current and future digital technologies. Within the framework of current challenges relating to sustainable development, globalization, and economic constraints it is important to interrogate and question how we might go about using established and emerging technologies in textiles in a positive manner"--
