Over the past 30 years the relative incomes and employment rates of immigrants have sunk, while immigrants unemployment rates rose. The overrepresentation in the welfare transfer system and an increasing housing segregation cause concern and is much debated. The general opinion is that immigrants are less integrated into the Swedish society today than in former times. The aim of this literature review is to if this is true. The working hypothesis is that immigrants were integrated during the period 1945-1975. A set of nine variables are discussed to examine whether the immigrants 1945-1975 were integrated. Although explorative by its character, the results indicate that immigrants were not as integrated in former times as commonly believed. Contrary to common belief significant improvements in integration has, in some areas, actually been achieved! The integration of immigrants has not changed from good to bad, but rather from bad to worse. .

It is a common concern that non-resident private forest owners are less able to make informed decisions regarding their forests. Moreover, the present guidance given by forest professionals is not reaching all owners. In this study, we suggest enhancing knowledge exchange among forest owners by increasing their mutual and informal interaction that could inspire them to co-construct new knowledge. The first objective is to identify present emerging activities that constitute knowledge exchange contexts (communities) for Finnish forest owners. The second objective is to discuss the challenges of current Finnish forest extension and their implications when introducing Communities of Practice as a complementary response to existing, yet insufficient, professional-led extension. Data consist of Finnish forest owners' and forest professionals' (n=43) focus group interviews. The qualitative analysis was theoretically oriented followed by data-driven coding and grouping. According to the results, the role of expert-led encounters is strong in Finland and owners' opportunities for good mutual communication are rare. Informal communities exist mainly in the countryside among neighbouring owners and within families. To enhance knowledge sharing among owners, one needs to identify innovative topics and activities that would inspire owners to commit to their forest property and perform active silviculture. These communities would operate as creative learning environments allowing participation of different levels. When cultivating forest owners' communities it is important to consider actors' roles. Forest owners themselves are responsible for the functions and continuity of these communities, although forest professionals could also initiate new and sufficiently homogenous reference groups for the owners.

The objective of the research is to investigate the motivation factors based on which smartphone users decide to record emotional data and share in the social networks. One intention is to find out the motivations smartphone users have when they participate in the social networks and how these motivations persuade them to create content. Another intention is to determine the benefits of sharing that content.    The theoretical framework was based on Amarasinghe's intrinsic motivation and ex-trinsic motivation, Becker and Clement's basic motives of file sharing and motivation to free ride, Bishop's principles of action, and Burke, Marlow and Lento's mechanisms motivating contribution in social media.     The research was conducted in the form of deductive research using qualitative research methods. The main themes were established based on the literature review and the in-depth interviews were conducted based on the established themes. The data in this research was collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews with three types of respondents: top user of a website, heavy user of social media, and sharer of file sharing networks. The analytical approach of the study was qualitative.    The findings revealed that smartphone users might have intrinsic motivation and ex-trinsic motivation but the decision to contribute is based on the principles of action. Basic motives of file sharing are the same. However, mechanisms motivating newcomer contribution in social media are not the same. The results showed how the organization owning the platform can benefit in many ways by carefully designing their website. It suggested that there are several features stimulating the sharing activities of a website's content.     In conclusion, smartphone users make the decision to record and share emotional data based on their own values and beliefs, the benefits they perceive from the social net-work provided by sharing their emotional data, and how well the social network is integrated with other tools of social media.

This article summarises a study of the purposefulness, structure and amount of external learning networks formed during an interdisciplinary higher education programme based on a LAB studio model. The LAB studio model is a learning model, which develops connections between working-life based problems and the recognition and development of the related business prototypes and startups. The LAB studio model is theoretically grounded in a constructivist view of learning with a project-based education at its core and has a key goal of educating entrepreneurship competences. The data for the study was collected through semi-structured interviews with six student teams (N=35) during May 2015. The data analysis took place through mixed methods, which as a method focuses on collecting, analysing, and mixing both quantitative and qualitative data. Findings show that the LAB studio model challenges and enables students to develop new learning networks external to the traditional university environment. New learning networks are created due to the demanding problem -solving process used in the teaching activities. Overall, the education programme broke down barriers between the education environment and external business environment through the establishment of learning networks. In conclusion, the learning networks formed during the education programme were wide-ranging, and the role of students was active and self-directive. Furthermore, we suggest that social capital was increased during the educational process.
