"With a foreword from Mark Harrison FSA, National Policing and Crime Advisor, English Heritage and Honorary Research Fellow, University of Kent, UK. Heritage crime is an area of growing interest for scholars, but also for enforcement agencies and heritage managers, as well as the communities affected. Whether it is the looting of cultural objects, theft of lead from churches, or vandalism of historic monuments, this timely collection brings together debate and international examples to demonstrate the diversity but also commonality of heritage crime across the globe. With international contributions from archaeology, criminology, law, heritage management and policing, the volume presents case studies from countries as diverse as Peru, the UK, South Africa and Cyprus. At a time when government agencies and media around the world are increasingly taking note of the implications of criminal activity for cultural heritage, this collection is the first to address the heritage crime problem in such an in-depth and holistic manner.
