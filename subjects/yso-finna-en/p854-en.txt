When it comes to perceptions of what is a sustainable economy and how it may be realised, companies expanding into Central and Eastern European markets face the challenge of diverse people, attitudes and history. Corporate Social Performance in Emerging Markets provides an effective tool for companies to help them engage in CSR activities and become a responsible company in CEE countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. It does this by enabling them to focus on the difference of stakeholders and their attitudes to those of Western Europe.The author, Zsofia Lakatos, provides a review of the major differences between the various CEE countries, supported by interview research from leading executives in some of the blue-chip companies already operating in the region.
Political accountability is a crucial element of any democracy since it is a safeguard against power abuse and corruption, both urgent problems of many political systems in Southeast Asia. Based on social science theories, the author analyses from a comparative perspective the ways institutional engineering concerning different dimensions of political accountability influenced the quality of democracy in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. By highlighting the successes and shortcomings, this book evaluates the degree these institutional reforms resulted in the deepening, stagnation, or regression of the respective democratization processes in these three Southeast Asian countries.

Abstract: Corporate responsibility reporting based on GRI reporting standard : development of reporting of case companies Cargolux, Finnair and SAS. This thesis examined the corporate responsibility (CR) reporting. The thesis consists of theoretical part and a multiple case study, in which the CR reports of three European airlines are analysed. All of the case companies are reporting according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which is the most commonly used reporting standard globally. The aim of the study was to find out how the CR reports of the case companies have developed during the past five years and how well the reports match the GRI reporting guidelines. Also some conclusions were drawn on how the reports could be improved further. This study was conducted by using qualitative research methods. The theoretical part was constructed by thorough research of literature on the topic. The main sources of information for the case study were the CR reports of the case companies from the past five years. Also an interview of one company representative was conducted to gain insight to matters that were left unanswered after the study of the literature and the reports. The findings of the study show that GRI guidelines set a good basis for the reporting, but still leave enough latitude for the companies to emphasise the matters they find the most relevant. It was noticed that environmental issues were given the most space in the reports, but during the recent years there has been a significant rise in the reporting of social matters.

The accountable leader
Patagonia, Inc. is one of the earth's most interesting and inspiring companies. For almost forty years, its reputation for high quality, maverick innovation, and long-term environmental responsibility has put it in a class by itself. And everything flows from Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, whose creation myth is now an American business legend. Here, Yvon Chouinard relates his and his company's story and the core philosophies that have sustained Patagonia, Inc. year in and year out. This is not another story of a successful businessman who manages on the side to do great good and have grand adventures; it's the story of a man who brought doing good and having grand adventures into the heart of his business model--and who enjoyed even more business success as a result.--From publisher description.

Who is responsible for global environmental sustainability?
In 1984, R. Edward Freeman published his landmark book, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, a work that set the agenda for what we now call stakeholder theory. In the intervening years, the literature on stakeholder theory has become vast and diverse. This book examines this body of research and assesses its relevance for our understanding of modern business. Beginning with a discussion of the origins and development of stakeholder theory, it shows how this corpus of theory has influenced a variety of different fields, including strategic management, finance, accounting, management, marketing, law, health care, public policy, and environment. It also features in-depth discussions of two important areas that stakeholder theory has helped to shape and define: business ethics and corporate social responsibility. The book concludes by arguing that we should re-frame capitalism in the terms of stakeholder theory so that we come to see business as creating value for stakeholders.

In an age where issues like climate change and the unintended consequences of technological innovation are high on the ethical and political agenda, questions about the nature and extent of our responsibilities to future generations have never been more important, yet simultaneously so difficult to answer. This book takes a unique approach to the problem by drawing on diverse traditions of thinking about care (including developmental psychology, phenomenology and feminist ethics) to explore the nature and meaning of our relationship with the future. Demonstrating that many influential perspectives on intergenerational ethics, including positions advanced by John Rawls, Brian Barry, and Ulrich Beck are undermined by problems relating to uncertainty, it shows that an approach based on care ethics can confront the uncertain future successfully and give a viable account of the nature and scope of future-oriented responsibilities.
