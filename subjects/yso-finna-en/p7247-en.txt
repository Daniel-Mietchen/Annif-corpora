Although a primeval form of conflict, stateless warfare is still very much in existence in the 21st century. This is mainly because the insurgent stateless warfare of guerrillas and terrorists has been continually modernising since the 1800s in a manner similar to the three-phase modernisation of non-democratic regimes. Brooker makes this the focus of the first part of his fascinating book. He then moves on to examine the guerrilla and terrorist modes of insurgency, its revolutionary, separatist and expeller types as well as its two formats, the bandit-like and the gangster-like. The second part describes the forensic calculus of motive, means and opportunity that explains and predicts insurgents' degree of success. This framework assesses insurgents' motivation, their methods and capability, their military and political opportunity and their social opportunity for winning political support. Brooker concludes by predicting a fourth, apocalyptic phase in the modernisation of stateless warfare -- and an accompanying fourth, Orwellian phase in the modernisation of non-democratic rule.
