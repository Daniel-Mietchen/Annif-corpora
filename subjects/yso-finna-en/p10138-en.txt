One of the largest and most complex human services systems in history has evolved to address the needs of people with developmental disabilities, yet important questions remain for many professionals, administrators, and parents. What approaches to early intervention, education, therapy, and remediation really help those with autism and other developmental disabilities improve their functioning and adaptation? Alternatively, what approaches represent wastes of time, effort, and resources?Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities, 2nd Edition brings together leading behavioral scientists and practitioners to shed much-needed light on the major controversies surrounding these questions. Expert authors review the origins, perpetuation, and resistance to scrutiny of questionable practices, and offer a clear rationale for appraising the quality of various services.The second edition of Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities has been fully revised and updated and includes entirely new chapters on psychology fads, why applied behavioral analysis isn't a fad, rapid prompting, FAPE advocacy, BCBA practices and beliefs, and teaching ethics. The book concludes with a brief parents guide to autism treatments.

Towards a critical sociology : an essay on commonsense and emancipation
This work, first published in 1990, reissues the first thorough examination of the essentially masculine nature of Max Weber's social and political thinking. Through a detailed examination of his central texts, the author demonstrates Weber's masculine reading of 'social life' and shows how his work advocates a masculine form of life that poses a challenge to contemporary women and to feminism. In particular, she addresses the patriarchal implications of Weber's belief in the need to relegate the ethic of brotherly love to a private sphere in order to make possible rational action and the achievement of greatness in the public sphere.

Abstract:.
The actual foundation of the conference industry in Tampere took an appropriate shape after the establishment of Tampere Hall in 1990. Since then Tampere has been very active in promoting and organizing conferences of all kinds. The purpose, thus, of this study was to describe the process of organizing and managing conferences and analyze the conference industry in the Tampere Region. Sources of conference theories were used to describe the historical background of the industry's origin, its development and current trend. Data for analysis of Tampere as a conference destination were obtained through a standard questionnaire during the 23rd European Conference on Biomaterials (ESB 2010) at Tampere Hall on 11-15 September 2010. Quantitative analysis of the data was conducted through SPSS. The findings indicate that the industry dates back in 1884 during the congress of Vienna and developed into a proper industry in America in the 20th century. The findings reveal also that the process of organizing and managing conferences is a long procedure that involves several key players and encompasses other sectors such as tourism. It has also been noted that conference industry in Tampere existed even before the advent of Tampere Hall. It was due to Tampere being active in research, education and theater culture, plus due to the decline of the early industry in the region that brought about the establishment of purpose-built conference center - Tampere Hall. Conferences is an international industry that still grows. Despite offering massive employment opportunities and contributing to the world economy it lacks consistent data for quantification. There are less conference related courses in universities and the demand for professionals is on the increase. More courses on meeting events should be introduced in universities as a proactive approach in developing the industry in the region. Tampere Convention Bureau should work together with academic institutions to devise a method of managing meeting events records, and studies need to be carried out on the environmental impact of conference tourism. Key words: Conference, meetings industry, meeting events, tourism.
