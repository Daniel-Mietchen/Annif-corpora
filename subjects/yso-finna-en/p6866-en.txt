International handbook of research on conceptual change
Conceptual change research investigates the processes through which learners substantially revise prior knowledge and acquire new concepts. Tracing its heritage to paradigms and paradigm shifts made famous by Thomas Kuhn, conceptual change research focuses on understanding and explaining learning of the most the most difficult and counter-intuitive concepts. Now in its second edition, the book provides a comprehensive review of the conceptual change movement and of the impressive research it has spawned on students' difficulties in learning. In thirty-one new and updated chapters, organized thematically and introduced by Stella Vosniadou, this volume brings together detailed discussions of key theoretical and methodological issues, the roots of conceptual change research, and mechanisms of conceptual change and learner characteristics. Combined with chapters that describe conceptual change research in the fields of physics, astronomy, biology, medicine and health, and history, this handbook presents writings on interdisciplinary topics written for researchers and students across fields.

Building on the features which have been successful characteristics of the previous editions, this revision will retain the same underlying focus and conceptual structure, but will be modified to reflect changes in the discipline as well as insights based on feedback from students and faculty using the text. The central concept of "Approaches to Psychology" is reflected in the title: that psychology is a complex discipline based on a variety of approaches to understanding human behaviour. The rationale for this structure has been, and remains, that examining the origins and central concepts of the major approaches is an effective way of presenting an introduction to the field."Approaches to Psychology" offers a compact introductory text which presents the content in a readable, understandable way, based on a structure which is both distinguishable from other texts and already 'field-tested'. The same basic structure will be retained in the new edition. Essentially, this means an initial introductory chapter, chapters devoted to each of the five major approaches, and chapters which provide a comparative analysis of how the approaches can be applied to the same central issues (development, social behaviour, and abnormal behaviour). In addition, there will be a summary chapter, as well as an appendix which examines research methods and statistical analysis.
