Learn how to formulate critical responses to the dances you see, create, and perform. In Dancers Talking Dance, author Larry Lavender outlines the five-step ORDER approach to critical evaluation: Observation, Reflection, Discussion, Evaluation, and Recommendations for revisions. Lavender introduces and explains the approach by interweaving practical, how-to examples with explanations of the theories underlying each step. He also provides writing and discussion ideas designed to stimulate thinking about the critical process and how it works. With these skills, you will learn how to observe, describe, analyze, write, and talk more effectively about dances and other works of art. Dancers Talking Dance will enrich your choreography experiences and expand you critical skills, helping you to become a more articulate, creative, and confident dancer.

Dancers and critics
Through the Eyes of a Dancer compiles the writings of noted dance critic and editor Wendy Perron. In pieces for The SoHo Weekly News, Village Voice, The New York Times, and Dance Magazine, Perron limns the larger aesthetic and theoretical shifts in the dance world since the 1960s. She surveys a wide range of styles and genres, from downtown experimental performance to ballets at the Metropolitan Opera House. In opinion pieces, interviews, reviews, brief memoirs, blog posts, and contemplations on the choreographic process, she gives readers an up-close, personalized look at dancing as an art form. Dancers, choreographers, teachers, college dance students - and anyone interested in the intersection between dance and journalism - will find Perron's probing and insightful writings inspiring. Through the Eyes of a Dancer is a nuanced microcosm of dance's recent globalization and modernization that also provides an opportunity for new dancers to look back on the traditions and styles that preceded their own

The dance experience : insights into history, culture, and creativity
For twenty-five years, Ann Cooper Albright has been exploring the intersection of cultural representation and somatic identity in dance. For Albright, dancing is a physical inquiry, a way of experiencing and participating in the world, and her writing reflects an interdisciplinary approach to seeing and thinking about dance. In her engagement as both a dancer and a scholar, Albright draws on her kinesthetic sensibilities as well as her intellectual knowledge to articulate how movement creates meaning. Throughout Engaging Bodies movement and ideas lean on one another to produce a critical theory anchored in the material reality of dancing bodies. This blend of cultural theory and personal circumstance will be useful and inspiring for emerging scholars and dancers looking for a model of writing about dance that thrives on the interconnectedness of watching and doing, gesture and thought.
