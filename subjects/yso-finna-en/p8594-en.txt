"This book focuses on China's increasing involvement in global governance as a result of the phenomenal rise in its global power. It provides a comprehensive assessment of China's increasing influence over how world affairs are being managed, how other major powers are reacting to the increasing Chinese clout in global governance, and what the consequences and implications are for the evolving global system and world order as well as for China itself."--Publisher's description.

Small arms, crime and conflict : global governance and the threat of armed violence
In this hugely influential book, originally published in 2001 but just as- if not more- relevant today, Mark Duffield shows how war has become an integral component of development discourse. Aid agencies have become increasingly involved in humanitarian assistance, conflict resolution and the social reconstruction of war- torn societies. Duffield explores the consequences of this growing merger of development and security, unravelling the nature of the new wars and the response of the international community, in particular the new systems of global governance that are emerging as a result. An essential work for anyone studying, interested in, or working in development or international security. -- Back cover.

The struggle for women's rights and to overcome gender oppression has long engaged the efforts of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations. Feminist Strategies in International Governance provides a new introduction to the contemporary forms of this struggle. It brings together the voices of academics and practitioners to reflect in particular on the effectiveness of human rights strategies and gender mainstreaming. It covers three international issue areas in which feminists currently seek change: women's human rights and violence against women; the participation of women in peace-making and their protection during conflict; and the gendered effects of development, economic and financial governance. The book combines a critical reflection on the current state of feminist politics with an introduction to urgent issues on the contemporary international agenda. In addition, the book draws on innovative conceptualizations from constructivism in international relations, legal anthropology and discourse theory to provide new framings of current feminist struggles. Offering an accessible guide to the engendering of international governance and examining the challenges for international feminist politics in the future, this work will be of great interest to students and scholars of international organizations, gender politics and global governance.
Since the 1990s many of the assumptions that anchored the study of governance in international political economy have been shaken loose. Reflecting on the intriguing and important processes of change that have occurred, and are occurring, the editors bring together the best research currently being undertaken in the field.
