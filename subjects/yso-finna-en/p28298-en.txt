Fashion spectacles, spectacular fashion : eyewear styles and shapes from vintage to 2020
The 20th century marked a turning point in spectacle design. Eyewear, which had previously been classed as purely functional, was transformed into an ultra-chic fashion accessory. This irresistible sourcebook features vintage glasses of all shapes, styles and sizes the very best of 20th- and 21st-century spectacle design. It is based on Simon Murray's amazing collection, built up over decades of avid collecting from optometrists, markets and antique shops across the globe. The book also includes futuristic eyewear, thus extending the timespan of the collection into the 2020s and beyond.
