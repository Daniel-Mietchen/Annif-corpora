"Tasting Wine and Cheese explains how to taste, evaluate and appreciate wine and cheese, helping you learn how 'taste' works, how to think about food and wine in general, and how to bring them together in combinations that will bring a smile to your face! But, learning is only half the fun. Tasting Wine and Cheese accompanies you on a tasty safari into pairing principles through individual chapters that highlight wines and the cheeses that love them. Each chapter (sparkling, white, red and dessert/fortified) presents individual wine types in a clear, informative way that is at once an excellent reference and entertaining. Simply look up the grape you're drinking that night, and a wealth of pairing information is at your fingertips. There's even a chapter on using condiments in your pairings to add another layer of flavor to your combinations,"--Amazon.com.
