The chapters in this book are the key presentations from the 6th International Conference hosted by Skådalen Resource Centre and the Department of Special Needs Education in Oslo, October 2005 - To be or to become: Language and learning in the lives of young deaf children The aim of the conference was to relate recent knowledge on language development and learning in young children in general to the issues faced by professionals working with young deaf children.
