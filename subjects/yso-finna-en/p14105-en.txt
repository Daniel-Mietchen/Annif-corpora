The purpose of this thesis project was to improve the business activities of Johnson Electronics Nigeria Limited.      Johnson Electronics Nigeria Limited is a Nigerian electronics store. The store has four stores one of them being the head office with a warehouse to keep the excess products. The stores sell different varieties of electronics and electrical products, such as pressing irons, videos, speakers, air conditioner and computers among others.      Presently, the keeping of records in the stores is done manually so there are some problems associated with that since there are no automated systems in use. Coordinating the activities of all stores and the head office warehouse are difficult without a proper system, hence there is need to have a working system that would make the coordination easy and effective.     Within this thesis project, an automated cash management system was created to replace the manual one. The analysis of the present state was done by using the following business engineering methods: the object oriented method and the entity structure analysis.    There is a sales assistant in every store handling the sales activities; a stock keeper taking care of each store's warehouse activities; and a branch accountant heading each store and reporting to the chief accountant. Hence there is need to phase out the stock keepers and branch accountants who make the present system cumbersome.     This thesis project was important to facilitate and improve the sales and stock management system of the Johnson Electronics Nigeria Limited.  The improved system will make recording of sales activities (cash event) and stock activities (stock event) more orderly. There will be easy access to data when needed. The manager and the accountant will be able to make decisions quickly based on easily retrievable facts.

Abstract: The goal of this project was to explain the steps taken to create a Graphical user interface (GUI) for the SIMO forest management-planning framework. This was achieved using the Flex Flash builder. The SIMO UI was built as a client-server. The method used in the project was to devise an experimental model that would make it easy to build the GUI with fewer codes and still makes it flexible and easy to maintain in the near future. Mapping the XML directly with the components model was finally used since it is the only popular method used frequently in encoding and decoding XML documents. The results obtained showed that the Flex Adobe datagrid was not fully developed for the project and as such, I had to create a custom datagrid, the datasheet. Furthermore, as at the time of building the GUI, there was no credible way to work with namespaced XML. This problem was later solved through a series of research and writing custom-components to suit the application. In conclusion, the goal of the project was achieved, flexibility and maintainability, but at the expense of excess codes.
