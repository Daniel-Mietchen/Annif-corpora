But when everything goes wrong, he finds himself at the tender mercies of one of Society's most untouchable women--Lady Susanna Derring..... Susanna has spent her life in London's glittering ton, under the thumb of a domineering mother--and she wants out. When a wickedly charming rogue lands at her feet, she jumps at the chance to experience life before it's too late. But as she descends into London's underworld, she finds that nothing--not even Gideon--is as it seems.

The curious affair of somnambulist and the psychic thief
In this sharp and darkly mysterious novel Lenk and his fellow adventurers must find their way through the silk-trading city of C'Jer Daal as demons and gods stalk the streets in a battle for dominion even as the thieves guilds go to war for their own petty ends.  Mixing wild magics, exciting swordplay, mystery and an irrestible, if scurrilous, sense of humour this is a hugely exciting new direction for fantasy. Full of adventure and extreme imagination it nevertheless manages to weave in a surprising subtlety and sensitivity in it's characterisation.
