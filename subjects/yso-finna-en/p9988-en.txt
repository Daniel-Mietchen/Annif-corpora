The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to create a practical handbook on the rules of the edectricity, instrumentation and telecommunication systems of a cabin in the offshore industry which could be used in planning and on site as help. The work was commissioned by ALMACO Group Oy which the author have worked during the assignment as a trainee and nowadays as a designer. Five classification societies and one standardization organization have been chosen for the comparison. In the thesis the difference of the classification societies is compared with the standardization organization IEC, which operates internationally and is a basis for the rules and regulations of the classification societies. The geographical origin of the classification institutions as well as the history of the offshore technology have affected the forming of the rules. Consequently, the differencies between the classes can be considerable. It is essential to know about the systems in the areas which the rules affect in order to understand the rules and regulations. The professionals of the field who were likely to comment on certain systems have been interviewed for this work. As a result, a manual to which the most central rules and their comparison are collected was accomplished. There is hardly any experience of the functionality of the manual in real situations. Due to this, the book will change its form when there is more experience. Every year the classification institutions update their rules, which have to be followed in case of changes. The objective is to update the manual once a year of if necessary.
