Design and equipment for restaurants and foodservice : a management view
"This text shows the reader how to plan and develop a restaurant or foodservice space. Topics covered include concept design, equipment identification and procurement, design principles, space allocation, electricity and energy management, environmental concerns, safety and sanitation, and considerations for purchasing small equipment, tableware, and table linens. This book is comprehensive in nature and focuses on the whole facility--with more attention to the equipment--rather than emphasizing either front of the house or back of the house"--
