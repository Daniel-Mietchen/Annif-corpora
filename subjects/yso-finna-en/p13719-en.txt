"In March 1946, scientists began to track thousands of children born in one cold week. No one imagined that this would become the longest-running study of human development in the world, growing to encompass five generations of children. Today, they are some of the best-studied people on the planet, and the simple act of observing human life has changed the way we are born, schooled, parent and die. This is the tale of these studies and the remarkable discoveries that have come from them. Touching almost every person in Britain today, they are one of our best-kept secrets."

Abstract: The purpose of the study was to give a clear vision of the corporate image; mainly  what is it, how to manage it and how to study it. And more importantly make a follow  up corporate image research for Dynaset Oy. The reason for choosing the subject was  the need of Dynaset Oy for this information in the future to be able to modify the image  its interests groups have from the company, and to develop and revise it more  close to the goal image company has. Similar study has been made in 2008 – and after  6 years company is interested to know how the image has changed, as well as has is  changed to wanted direction as follow-up procedure.  The theoretical framework of the research was based on the corporate image researchstructure  created by Leena Chydenius as well as referred the RepMap™-reputation  research model created by Viestintätoimisto Pohjoisranta. First part of the research  explored the current stage of the corporate image of Dynaset Oy, second part compared  the changes happened since previous research and evaluated the effectiveness  of development programme created in 2008, third part created a goal corporate image  for Dynaset Oy and created a strategy for the company to be able to modify the current  corporate image to more similar as the goal corporate image of the company is.  The research used both quantitative and qualitative research methods, in more precise  publicity analysis, interviews and surveys to collect data. Research used same research  methods as research made in 2008, which enabled the comparison of the results  of current corporate image.  The follow up corporate image research made for Dynaset Oy was able to gather sufficient  amount of information and was able to conclude the current stage of company's  corporate image. Based on the results company's corporate image was seen positive  and valued among Dynaset's interest groups, the results revealed shortages on  company's operations and public image. Comparison between research results revealed,  that corporate image of Dynaset Oy had maintained fairly similar, development  programme created in 2008 was found effective. The goal corporate image defined  Dynaset-brand. New development programme was created to be able to modify  the current corporate image to goal corporation image created.  Dynaset Oy agreed to follow the development procedures in presented way, and also  to conduct a new corporate image research within 2-3 years to find out whether the  stage of corporate image has changed to more similar as created goal corporate image  or not.

All the five Nordic countries have a long tradition in health statistics and health monitoring. The cornerstone of the national health information systems is register information. There are, for example, complete population-based registration of births and deaths, cancers, hospital care, and medication (Cappelen and Lysol 2004, Gissler and Haukka. 2004, Mortensen 2004, Otterblad Olausson et al. 2004). The main prerequisites for a functioning register system are its completeness and high quality. These are facilitated by the Nordic legislation allowing mandatory reporting from public and private sector without informed consent and the existence of unique person identity number system. .
