The aim of this thesis was to introduce the current technology that can be used in the virtual reality in education and research at Oulu University of Applied Sciences and explain the construction process of the 3D virtual laboratory to Oulu UAS. The secondary goal was to explain the basic elements that are needed in order to create content in virtual environment and give the basic knowledge for the faculty and students of Oulu UAS of the virtual reality possibilities and equipment that are in use at Oulu UAS. In this thesis some of the various aspects of a virtual reality hardware and software are analysed in a relation to human senses and the human factors affecting it are explained, since the basic understanding of some aspects of the human physiological and psychological characteristics is required in order to comprehend the virtual reality technology implementation requirements in both the software and hardware. The sources used in this thesis were selected with the criteria how relevant they were in relation to each subject under consideration. The majority of the chosen sources are commonly distinguished and sources without a proper scientific background were avoided as much as possible. In conclusion the results of the construction of Oulu UAS 3D virtual laboratory and the proposals how maintain and improve the competence for the virtual reality use at Oulu UAS are presented.

With the globally increasing environmental burdens and the recognition of the problem, industrial organisations have been encouraged to start defining, measuring and monitoring the environmental effects of their operations. The objective of this thesis was to design an environmental measurement system for Tikka Spikes Oy to measure the efficiency and performance of their environmental management system. The purpose was also to collect information on the company's environmental performance over the past three years (2010–2012), so that the current and future results may be compared with the past. This study was carried out as a three month project between November 2012 and January 2013. The theoretical section at the beginning of the thesis presents relevant information related to the environmental performance of an organisation. Data about the production quantities, energy consumption, waste generation and water utilisation of Tikka Spikes Oy were collected. The gathered data were utilised in measuring and estimating the environmental performance of the company. The data is presented in absolute, relative and trend formats. The thesis contains confidential material which is not included in the published version. The designed environmental measurement system gives a general overview of the key environmental characteristics and performance of Tikka Spikes Oy. The past results from the years 2010–2012 may be utilised to predict future trends. For example, estimating future environmental expenses may be done with the help of the designed environmental measurement system and the past results. In the future, the same key characteristics may be monitored in order to obtain continuous information on the development of the company's environmental performance. Further research would be required to obtain more detailed results on the environmental performance and the influence of the individual processes on it.

Motivations and means of corporate environmental responsiveness : evaluating proactive environmental strategy in multinationals based in Finland
Emerging to the forefront of sustainable production and consumption are a promising and rapidly evolving concept known as Voluntary Standard Systems (VSS). They encompass the three pillars of sustainability - social, environmental and economic aspects, and consequently they can be considered as a tool, which makes sustainable development visible. Currently, they are becoming a significant element in international trade and in the promotion of sustainable development strategies, especially in the context of globalised markets and supply chains. This volume provides a comprehensive overview of the current VSS concepts: from their nature and functioning, to the future outlook for their development. It places VSS in the broader context of global development issues and challenges, including development policy and international sustainability commitments, progress towards achieving 'green economy', and meeting climate protection targets. The volume contains also a representative selection of case studies which demonstrate their wide range of application in different sectors of the economy.

Campus futurus:perspectives on learning and technology
Prolongation of the growing season due to a warming climate could represent new opportunities for northern agriculture. Climatic and biotic constraints may challenge future crop production. The objective of this study was to speculate how a range of arable land use patterns, resulting from various policy driven choices, could be introduced into a farming system, and how they would affect the risks associated with nutrient leaching. We found that while adaptation to climate change must include consideration of crop choices, there are conflicts associated with allocations and rotations for various market and policy situations. The expected increase in nutrient loading in the simulations caused by climate change was moderate. The increase can partly be compensated for by changes in farmland use, more in the shorter term than in the longer term to mid-century. In the future, adaptation at cropping system level is potentially an efficient way to manage nutrient load risks.

"This book covers the integration of chemical fate modeling for use in Geographic Information System (GIS) functions. It features a practical and hands-on approach that's intended for modelers preparing maps of chemical emissions, and creating landscape and climate properties within a GIS, while chemical fate calculations are performed using specialized model codes. A relevant part of the book also discusses data retrieval and processing as a basis for modeling. As such, the book offers a one-stop reference for practitioners who wish to integrate GIS with chemical modeling"--

"From England to Australia, Sweden to South Korea, the international business community is embracing ISO 14000, the most flexible approach to environmental management yet devised. While a growing number of organizations are adopting its guidelines - with tremendous results - many are still hedging, unsure whether the benefits of implementation are worth their time, resources, and attention. This authoritative reference, written by an expert in the field, provides the information you need as a business manager to not only determine the appropriateness of ISO 14000 for your company, but to take the right steps toward successful certification." "Perry Johnson - an ISO authority who is the founder of both an ISO 14000 training organization and a full-service registration company - shares his expertise and insight to bring you a clear, detailed look at ISO 14000, including the business impact of standard conformance. With straightforward explanations, Johnson shows you where ISO 14000 will add value to your company, how to support the standard, and what you need to do to meet registration requirements. Most importantly, he reveals how certification can favorably impact your company's bottom line."--BOOK JACKET.
