Disturbance and Ecosystems : Components of Response
As we enjoy the Internet's bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Carr describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by "tools of the mind"--from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer--and interweaves recent discoveries in neuroscience. Now, he expands his argument into a compelling exploration of the Internet's intellectual and cultural consequences. Our brains, scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. Building on insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a case that every information technology carries a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. The printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In contrast, the Internet encourages rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information. As we become ever more adept at scanning and skimming, are we losing our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection?--From publisher description.

Among the issues explored in this text are the effects of heat, hydration, and cold in the thermal environment; diving, altitude training, and other pressure effects on the human system; and the influences that pollution and air quality have on exercise. The text also explores the microgravity (space) environment and chronobiological rhythms and their effects on exercise performance.

"Focusing on the worldwide impact of type 2 diabetes regarding nutrition, dietary modification, risk, and management, this book draws on evidence-based research and provides numerous epidemiologic cohort studies, as well as carefully conducted clinical trials. Chapters correlate treatment modes and risk factors as well as the global impact of nutrition back to the basic premise held in the etiology of the disease. Topics include historical perspectives; macronutrients, micronutrients, food, dietary beverages, and dietary patterns; diet-gene interactions; and the role of age, ethnicity, and other demographics in modifying treatment for type 2 diabetes"--Provided by publisher.

"Assessing Neuromotor Readiness for Learning is a substantially revised and expanded edition of a long established INPP training manual that has been consistently proven in practice. The package includes tests for children, a developmental movement programme, and online access to INPP video training materials. Based on the proven INPP model for neuromotor development screening and intervention, which is unique in having been rigorously evaluated in research and practice Expands and revises an INPP manual which has previously only been available to training customers, and which is a foundation stone of the overall INPP approach Places emphasis on children's physical development and how neuro-motor skills provide the foundations for learning success. The package includes batteries of tests for younger and older children, a developmental movement programme, and online access to INPP video training materials"-- Provided by publisher.
