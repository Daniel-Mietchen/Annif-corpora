When Jack climbs over a wall to get his football back from the derelict building down his street, he doesn't expect to find a nest full of baby owls! Worried that the building is going to be knoked down by builders, Jack and his parents call the RSPCA. A rescue ensues, followed by an attempted hand feeding. But the birds are too young to be fed. Instead, the RSPCA must move the baby owls to another nest if they are to have a chance of survival. Jack must help the RSPCA to find the perfect nest in his neighbourhood. â€“  WorldCat.
