The paper examines the impact of American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listings on   the return of underlying Russian stocks.The contribution of this   paper is twofold.First, it looks at a new sample of ADRs issued by Russian companies.Second, the technique used to estimate the market model is different from the previous studies.The returns are modeled to follow a GARCH process, as opposed to the usual OLS procedure, which assumes homoscedasticity in   residual returns.Average abnormal returns and cumulative average abnormal returns are calculated for the [-25, +25] event window, with the ADR listing date being the event date.The results indicate a significant negative abnormal local market return on an ADR listing day.Return volatilities after the listing are compared to those before the listing. Eleven out of sixteen companies experienced increased volatility of local returns after cross-listing .

This thesis aims at answering the question regarding the reasonability of real options valuation in the hotel industry by conducting a case study with the support of secondary and primary research.  By incorporating the value of individual capital investment opportunities into a project's gross  present value, real options valuation can be characterised as an extension of traditional valua-tion approaches such as the discounted cash flow methods, thereby reducing their uncertainty,  inflexibility, and incomprehensiveness.    Taking advantage of the analogy between financial and real options, institutionalised valuation methods such as the Black-Scholes formula (1973) or the binomial options pricing model by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) have been applied to evaluate different options of a real hotel investment project.     Although controversially discussed and so far practically unproven in the hotel industry due to a certain complexity, it is shown that it can be very valuable to incorporate real options into the valuation process.      Based on several simplifications and by recognising the need to investigate each individual option more in detail, this thesis reveals that the evaluation of real options can serve as an important decision base for hotel investors under the condition of a fairly certain future outlook and relatively stable environmental conditions.

Stock Investing For Dummies, 5th Edition will contain 20% new and revised material designed to keep this title competitive as the stock market prepares to go through a series of changes and responds to global upheavals. Since the last edition, there is plenty of solid, new information on the news, views and resources that stock investors will need to navigate.
This article gives an overview of the role, microstructure and the present state of development of the Tallinn Stock Exchange (TSE). This topic has not been discussed widely enough by foreign media because the TSE is still quite young, having commenced operations on 31 May 1996.The rules of the TSE allow a certain degree of freedom but at the same time entail fairly high standards for participants.That is one of the reasons why activity on the TSE is growing so rapidly.For the year, the TSE outperformed the stock exchanges in Riga and Vilnius in many areas, as measured by most indicators.The TSE has also provided numerous benefits to both Estonia and companies whose shares are traded.For instance, Estonia's financial system is now considered to have reached a developed stage and companies are finding it easier to raise capital because the TSE provides an objective assessment of their value.  Keywords:Equities markets, stock exchanges, Estonia .
