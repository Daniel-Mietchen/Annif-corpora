"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an often-cited topic among researchers and practitioners. This essential book explains the concept and potential that the IoT presents, from mobile applications that allow home appliances to be programmed remotely, to solutions in manufacturing and energy conservation. Coverage features a tutorial for implementing the IoT using IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 and answers critical questions such as what is the IoT, how can it help my organization, what is the cost of deploying this system, and what are the security issues?"--

The only single-source reference on the concept and implementation of TCP/IP in LinuxAs open source software becomes a trusted part of business and research systems, it's no wonder that a combination of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and the Linux operating system is becoming more common. TCP/IP's prevalence allows easy communication among computers using various operating systems, whether Windows, Mac OS, Linux, or Unix. And Linuxb́ecause it is open source and thus modifiableh́as become a frequent choice for developers who want a customizable operating system on which to build their applications.This book describes the design and implementation of TCP/IP in Linux, from simple client-server applications to more complex executions. Topical coverage includes:. Basic socket concepts and implementations. The Linux implementation of network packets. TCP read/write. TCP algorithms for data transmission and congestion control. TCP timers. IP layer and routing tables implementation. IP forwarding and quality of service implementation. Netfilter hooks for the stacks. Network Soft IRQ. How to debug a TCP/IP stackAll topics are discussed in a concise, step-by-step manner and the book is complemented with helpful illustrations to give readers a better understanding of the subject. TCP/IP Architecture, Design, and Implementation in Linux is an indispensable resource for embedded-network product developers, network security product developers, IT network architects, researchers, and graduate students.
