"Schema therapy combines proven cognitive behaviour therapy techniques with elements of interpersonal, experiential and psychodynamic therapies in order to help people with long term mental health problems including personality disorders and chronic depression. Schema therapy suggests that many negative cognitive conditions are based on past experiences, and therefore provides models for challenging and modifying negative thoughts and behaviours in order to provoke change. In this book, Jeffrey Young, Eshkol Rafaeli, and David Bernstein - pioneers of the schema therapy approach - indicate the 30 distinctive features of schema therapy, and how the method fits into the broader CBT Spectrum. Divided into two sections The Distinctive Theoretical Features of Schema Therapy and The Distinctive Practical Features of Schema Therapy, this book will provide a concise introduction for those new to the technique, as well as a discussion of how it differs from the other cognitive behavioural therapies for those experienced in the field"--Provided by publisher.
Abstract.
"The psychological impact of dealing with the stress of the daily management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be arduous and challenging. Yet this area is rarely discussed in medical settings despite the fact that the emotional context can undermine the person's ability to stay motivated in the essential self-care tasks that are vital for good health.Diabetes and Wellbeing presents a range of research-based psychological principles that have been demonstrated to positively impact emotional wellbeing. It covers a broad spectrum of diabetes care from managing the initial diagnosis, overcoming depression and diabetes 'burnout', dealing effectively with fears and anxiety, managing food and weight issues and eating disorders, coping with the impact of sexual difficulties, and communicating with healthcare professionals.Jen Nash effectively guides the reader through strategies for better management of the issues associated with living with diabetes, moving individuals towards greater physical and psychological wellbeing and - as a result - a healthier future. This innovative yet practical guide is invaluable for individuals living with diabetes, those supporting others with diabetes, and healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with diabetes"--

One in six people worldwide will experience depression over the course of a lifetime. Many who seek relief through the healthcare system are treated with antidepressant medication; in the United States, nearly 170 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written in 2005, resulting in more than #12 billion in sales. And yet despite the dominance of antidepressants in the marketplace and the consulting room, another treatment for depression has proven equally effective: psychotherapy--in particular, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Antidepressants can lift mood independent of a person's understanding of symptoms or stressors. By contrast, CBT teaches patients skills for dealing with distressing feelings, negative thoughts, and causal stressors. In The Ethical Treatment of Depression, Paul Biegler argues that the insights patients gain from the therapeutic process promote autonomy. He shows that depression is a disorder in which autonomy is routinely and extensively undermined and that physicians have a moral obligation to promote the autonomy of depressed patients. He concludes that medical practitioners have an ethical imperative to prescribe psychotherapy--CBT in particular--for depression. To make his case, Biegler draws on a wide philosophical literature relevant to autonomy and the emotions and makes a comprehensive survey of the latest research findings from the psychological sciences.
