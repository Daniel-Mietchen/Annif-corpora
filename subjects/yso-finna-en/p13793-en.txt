"Basic Pneumatics was developed as an introductory text for people who are studying to be maintenance personnel working on production machinery, and for upgrading the knowledge of other factory workers, including machine operators, line mechanics, and newly hired engineers. The book was designed to provide an alternative to the large number of books and manuals on the topic of pneumatics that have a heavy math and theoretical orientation. Basic Pneumatics is designed give a student a firm, hands-on foundation in the fundamentals of pneumatics. It presents a student with the basic competencies required to maintain and troubleshoot most of the pneumatic systems that he or she will encounter on the plant floor"--Back cover.
