"Focusing on the anatomic concepts that speech-language pathology students must master, Atlas of Neuroanatomy for Communication Science and Disorders is a user-friendly guide to the neural basis of human communication and brain-based disorders. With this book, students will acquire a full understanding of the basic anatomy and physiology of human communication; the neural mechanisms controlling speech, language, cognition, and swallowing functions; the anatomic underpinnings of speech-language disorders of the nervous system and related communication impairments; and much more. Features an extraordinary, full-color visual library of labeled anatomic illustrations, from Thieme's world-renowned Atlas of Anatomy Series"--Provided by publisher.

Microbes colonize nearly every biotic and abiotic niche on our planet. This also includes our human body, which is densely populated with microbes, the majority of which interact with us in a commensal, sometimes even mutualistic, relationship. Only a minority of our microbiota are pathogenic organisms with the ability to cause infection.This book covers various aspects of the interplay between commensal and pathogenic bacteria with their hosts. The chapters summarize recent findings on the geno- and phenotypic traits of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the impact of commensal and probiotic bacteria on intestinal physiology and health. The differential interaction of pathogenic, commensal and probiotic bacteria with their host is reviewed from both the bacterial and the host?s perspective to round out this compilation of articles on the differences and similarities of pathogenic and commensal microorganisms.

"Understanding Voice Problems: A Physiological Perspective for Diagnosis and Treatment emphasizes the physiological perspective of voice disorders and the behavioral and emotional factors that can influence these changes. Readers will find a strong foundation in normal phonatory physiology and acoustics as well as pathophysiology arising from voice misuse, abuse, or neurological involvement. Coverage includes in-depth explorations of patient interviewing, history-taking, examination, and testing and discussions of pediatric and geriatric voice considerations. The book contains numerous illustrations, including full-color plates of vocal fold pathologies. A companion Website features nearly 30 video clips that demonstrate healthy, normally functioning larynges at work, plus larynges with various pathological problems"--Provided by publisher.
