If you want to sew your own clothes but are put off by the idea of cutting out pattern pieces covered with dotted lines and symbols, this is the book for you. Using Rosie Martin's innovative method, you begin with nothing but a rectangle, circle or triangle of fabric and some basic body measurements. Next, follow the detailed step-by-step photographs and diagrams to complete your garment. You'll need a sewing machine, but no special equipment or expensive fabrics. With plenty of variations suggested, you can play with the designs to make garments exactly the way you want them.
