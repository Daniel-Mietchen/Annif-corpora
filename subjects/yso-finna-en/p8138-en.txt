Abstract: During extremely strong magnetic storms a sudden anomalous decrease in the F-layer critical frequency foF2 is sometimes noticed above Huancayo (12.0 S, 75.3 W) between 10 and 14 local time The duration of the phenomenon is from some tens of minutes to some hours. During the study period July 1958 - June 1960, seven phenomena were noted...
