This book explores the influence of Mexican culture and tradition, La Casa Azul and other places Frida Kahlo called home, on her life and work. La Casa Azul, now one of the most visited museums in Mexico City, was the artist's birthplace and the home where she grew up, lived with her husband Diego Rivera for a number of years, and also where she died. She spent long periods of time in the house convalescing, first in 1918 when she contracted polio and again, at the age of 18, after the trolley accident which left her badly injured. Confined to her bed and in constant pain and discomfort, she began to paint as a way to occupy her time. After marrying Rivera, Frida moved out of the Blue House, living in Mexico and abroad, moving for a brief time to the United States, until eventually returning to her childhood home. Fully illustrated, the book features Frida's paintings together with archive images and family photographs, objects and artefacts she collected and photographs of the surrounding landscape to provide an insight into how these places shaped this much-loved artist and how the homes and landscapes of her life relate to her work.

My history, not yours : the formation of Mexican American autobiography
"Mexican immigration to the United States - the oldest and largest immigration movement to this country - is in the midst of a fundamental transformation. For decades, Mexican immigration was primarily a border phenomenon, confined to Southwestern states. But legal changes in the mid-1980s paved the way for Mexican migrants to settle in parts of America that had no previous exposure to people of Mexican heritage. In New Destinations, editors Victor Zuniga and Ruben Hernandez-Leon bring together an inter-disciplinary team of scholars to examine demographic, social, cultural, and political changes in areas where the incorporation of Mexican migrants has deeply changed the preexisting ethnic landscape." "New Destinations looks at several of the communities where Mexican migrants are beginning to settle, and documents how the latest arrivals are reshaping - and being reshaped by - these new areas of settlement. Contributors use census data to diagram the historical evolution of Mexican immigration to the United States, noting the demographic, economic, and legal factors that led recent immigrants to move to areas where few of their predecessors had settled." "New Destinations is the first scholarly assessment of Mexican migrants' experience in the Midwest, Northeast, and deep South - the latest settlement points for America's largest immigrant group. Enriched by perspectives from demographers, anthropologists, sociologists, folklorists, and political scientists, this volume is an essential starting point for scholarship on the new Mexican migration."--BOOK JACKET.

The "I" in these critical essays by novelist, poet, scholar, and activist/curandera Ana Castillo is that of the Mexic-Amerindian woman living in the United States. The essays are addressed to everyone interested in the roots of the colonized woman's reality. Castillo introduces the term Xicanisma in a passionate call for a politically active, socially committed Chicana feminism. In "A Countryless Woman, " Castillo outlines the experience of the brown woman in a racist society that recognizes race relations mostly as a black and white dilemma. Essays on the Watsonville strike, the early Chicano movement, and the roots of machismo illustrate the extent to which women still struggle against male dominance. Other essays suggest strategies for opposing the suppression of women's spirituality and sexuality by institutionalized religion and the state. These challenging essays will be a provocative guide for those who envision a new future for women as we face a new century.

We are the daughters of Chicano working class families, who were able to receive a university education. Our history is the story of working people - their struggles, commitments, and strengths. We document, analyze and interpret the Chicana/Mexicana experience in the United States. We are particularly concerned with the conditions women face at work, in and out of the home. We continue our mother's struggle for social and economic justice. Our research strives to bridge the gap between intellectual work and active commitment to our communities. We welcome Chicanas who share these problems and goals and invite them to join our movement.
