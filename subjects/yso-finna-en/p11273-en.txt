Why raw? When cacao beans are naturally fermented and dried rather than roasted, they retain much more of their natural goodness. The process also means the berry and coffee notes found in raw chocolate's flavour are intensified - similar to unsweetened dark chocolate. Plus it's very versatile, works in savoury or sweet dishes and, most importantly, makes you feel good in your body and soul. Part of The Goodness Of series, Raw Chocolate offers well-chosen recipes that minimise cooking to ensure that as any of raw chocolate's nutrients as possible are retained to deliver the best benefits.
