"This comprehensive and popular textbook makes fractal geometry accessible to final-year undergraduate math or physics majors, while also serving as a reference for research mathematicians or scientists. This up-to-date edition covers introductory multifractal theory, random fractals, and modern applications in finance and science. New research developments are highlighted, such as porosity, while covering other much more sophisticated topics, such as fractal aspects of conformal invariance, complex dimensions, and non-commutative fractal geometry. The book emphasizes dimension in its various forms, but other notions of fractality are also prominent"--

Fractal modelling : growth and form in biology
This is a one-stop introduction to the methods of ergodic theory applied to holomorphic iteration. The authors begin with introductory chapters presenting the necessary tools from ergodic theory thermodynamical formalism, and then focus on recent developments in the field of 1-dimensional holomorphic iterations and underlying fractal sets, from the point of view of geometric measure theory and rigidity. Detailed proofs are included.
