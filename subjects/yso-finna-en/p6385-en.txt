Hazard identification methods
The aim of the thesis was to find and estimate a learning path which helps developing competence of operators who have basic technical skills. The objective of the study was to find and describe a learning path in the process industry environment so that their competence in maintenance could be developed systematically. This thesis was carried out by a qualitative method and included interviews, literature, researches, journals and articles etc. The interviews were implemented to different groups of personnel who were responsible for the production in three different process lines, in the spring of 2014. 18 employees took part in the interviews. The data were analysed by qualitative methods based on the researcher experience. According to the results, the operators had some competence doing small repair work and help in failure situations. The competence of reporting faults and using right channels for reporting needed improvement. According to the results, the operators needed mostly education to use the SAP-system, reporting the observed deviations and comprehend the purpose of other reporting channels. Also study, how to get skilled operators in five different areas. These were reporting, observation, documentation, failure elimination and safety. As a result of the study, a so called road map was found for a skilled operator which included steps to help managers to improve operator’s knowledge in maintenance activities.
