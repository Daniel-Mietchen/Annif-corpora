The purpose of this thesis was to prepare a market research and a thorough analysis on consumer buying behavior. This work introduces some of the famous theories of buying behavior and the aim is to apply these theories into the target segment of the market research. The purpose was also to analyse and clarify the questionnaire done in 2013 about osteoporosis treatment done in 2013. The questionnaire was ordered by an American company Amgen that manufactures, researches and develops biological medicines. The purpose of the questionnaire was to find out the factors that affect on the treatment and medicine choices of the doctors who prescribe osteoporosis medications. Also the potential barriers of prescribing Medicine X were investigated for future purposes. Consumer behaviour is studied by many marketing specialists, and the importance of understanding consumer behaviour has grown to be one of the key concepts of marketing. Consumer behaviour was chosen as the theoretical part for this thesis as the analysis of the questionnaire is founded on these theories. This thesis is focusing on the main factors that affect on consumer buying behavior and the buying decision process. After analyzing the questionnaire it was discovered that a majority of respondents were actually potential future prescribers of Medicine X. The reasons why there was resistance in trying the product were affected by the price, the lack of experience and research and a new dosing method.

The dynamics of body metabolism are changed in the disease process and interact with physical activity. The alteration of metabolism and its consequences raise the need for simple and reliable methods for assessment of body composition. The chapters aim to investigate various interacting components converging on metabolic changes in lung and muscle tissues taking into consideration the drug effects. The effects of exercise and nutritional status are dealt with at a great extent.
"Osteoporosis is a devastating disorder with significant physical and psychosocial consequences. There have been enormous advances in knowledge and understanding of the scientific and clinical aspects of osteoporosis over recent years. Due to this remarkable progress in the scientific understanding of its cause, diagnosis and treatment, this disease is now largely preventable." "Osteoporosis: an Atlas of Investigation and Management is a pictorial reference book designed to help doctors understand, prevent and overcome osteoporosis. This practical guide gives advice on how to diagnose and manage patients with this condition. It provides an invaluable overview of epidemiology, symptoms, clinical investigations, and the various treatments and interventions available."--BOOK JACKET.
