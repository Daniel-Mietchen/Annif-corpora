Treatment of obesity in children : a study on the efficacy of a family-based group program compared with routine counselling
Judging quality isn't robotically rational; it's emotional, cognitive, and social, too. Yet most academics' self-respect is rooted in their ability to analyze complexity and recognize quality, in order to come to the fairest decisions about that elusive god, "excellence."
