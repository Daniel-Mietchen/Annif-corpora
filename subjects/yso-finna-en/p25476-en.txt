Stereoscopic cinema & the origins of 3-D film, 1838-1952
The technological explosion and free access to information have transformed our world in something very different than even ten years ago. An immense surge of creativity has imbued our lives from technology to entertainment, thus allowing the creative industries to develop at a fast pace. But what is required from a professional working in the creative industry today to be successful, and how to become one? To answer this question, a qualitative research was conducted in the field of design, animation and games, which uncovered that what defines professional literacy today besides knowledge are endurance in face of change, self-reliance, intellectual curiosity, motivation, versatility, a desire to learn new things, a can-do attitude and an ability to communicate across a wide range of tools and specialties. These skills are built and maintained through continuous learning, which can become challenging if not done correctly. The good news is that learning itself is a skill that can be cultivated so that when implemented the right way it is productive and satisfying. The paper presents the latest findings about how learning can become a rewarding and successful lifelong endeavour. Lastly, the validity of those conclusions was tested in practice through a personal learning project of creating a 3D animation. The practical implementation confirmed that if the terms required for a successful outcome are in place and the learning methods applied consistently, the desired goal can be reached through a fulfilling and exciting learning experience.
