This indispensible guide to ship stability covers essential topics such as flotation and buoyancy, small angle, large angle and longitudinal stability, water density effects, bilging, ship resistance, and advanced hydrostatics. Each chapter has a comprehensive list of aims and objectives at the start of the topic, followed by a check-list at the end of the topic for students to ensure that they have developed all the relevant skills before moving onto the next topic area. The book features over 170 worked examples with fully explained solutions, enabling students to work through the examples to build up their knowledge and develop the necessary key skills. The worked examples, which range in difficulty from very simple one-step solutions to SQA standard exam questions and above, are predominantly based on a hypothetical ship. The reader is supplied with extracts from a typical data book for the ship which replicates those found on actual ships, enabling the reader to develop and practise real-life skills.

Topic for the thesis was founded when the author was doing internship in Viktor Lenac drydock in Rijeka, Croatia. Viktor Lenac is one of the biggest drydocks in Croatia and the Mediterranean that is specialized in class surveys, drydocking and repurposing vessels.  This qualitative research was to model sales process, juridical aspects of drydocking quotations and develops the sales process in order to achieve advantage in tight competition. Theoretical part of the thesis focuses on sales process and theory in service sales business. To theoretical part can also be added juridical aspects of drydocking in forms of classification surveys and flag state administration rules. Data for the empirical part has been collected with theme interviews inside the sales organization as well with customers and project organization. The empirical data has been fulfilled with personal experiences acquired while doing an internship inside the sales organization. The thesis in its current form is meant to be used as a tool in drydocking sales organization as well as improve the sales process to be more customer focused to achieve higher value in the drydocking sales process.
