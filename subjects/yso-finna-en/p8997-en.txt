Domestic Violence, Family Law and School discusses the ways in which domestic violence can impact on children's lives at pre-school and school. Disputes over parental responsibility, living arrangements or child contact can create difficulties not just for the child of disputing parents, but for all children at preschool or school, as well as for staff. This book uncovers new research on an under-explored area of children's lives and social work with vulnerable children and is shaped by a comparative lens that brings both similarities and differences between England, Wales and Sweden into focus. A theoretical framework for analyses of how welfare systems tackle domestic violence is elaborated and lessons for practice that can be drawn from the findings presented are highlighted.

The self-care of diabetes type 2 is essential for maintaining balanced glucose levels and avoiding complications of diabetes. Self-care is based on the person's ability to handle self-care activities, diet, exercise, medication and blood glucose self-monitoring. Successful self-care is constructed from personal and environmental factors, which are diabetes knowledge, self-care agency, self-efficacy and social support. Alcohol abuse reduces the compliance to self-care activities and has direct consequences on a diabetic. This thesis studies nurses' experiences of their alcoholic diabetics' self-care.     Qualitative approach was used in this research. The data was collected by semi-structured theme interviews of three nurses working in the diabetes ward, one as a diabetes nurse. The interviews were carried out during the summer 2007. The recorded data was made into verbatim transcriptions, from which qualitative content analysis was done.     The results showed that diabetes self-care activities were neglected when the patient was a hazardous drinker or an alcoholic. Neglected self-care was shown in many ways and it seriously affected the treatment sometimes. Alcohol abuse has a ruining effect on the factors that construct self-care, for example on the ability to master one's life, self-respect, mental health, motivation and social support. Because of alcoholism, the patient does not have the close relatives to support them anymore. The nurses themselves have a big role as providers of social support, which they try to do by motivating the patient. Many times with an alcoholic, frustration and hopelessness are the feelings they experience.     Alcoholism is robbing the base of treatment, making many of the efforts useless both in the self-care of the diabetic and also in nurses' work as a provider of social support. Programs to educate nurses on how to encounter hazardous drinkers and alcoholics should be developed. The problem of alcoholism should be treated aggressively, the chains of care should be effective to bite firmly on the alcohol problem, and nurses given tools to refer the patient to the right place.    Key words: Alcohol abuse, hazardous drinking, alcoholism, diabetes self-care, social support, diabetes knowledge, self-care agency, self-efficacy.
