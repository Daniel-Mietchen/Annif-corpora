Marketing has always been about "me" my brand, my product, my company. But "inside-out" marketing no longer works: your customers won't tolerate it anymore. You need to transform your marketing to "outside in." Every message you deliver must engage, fascinate, and motivate the right audiences, because you start and finish with what they already care about. Your marketing itself must provide value to customers -- whether they buy today, next month, or far into the future. How do you know what messages will do that? How do you get those messages past tough new digital gatekeepers? You start here, with Outside-In Marketing. -- Publisher.
