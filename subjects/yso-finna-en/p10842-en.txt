Ode to a skylark : agricultural intensification and farmland birds in the Baltic region
Provides a combination of selected case studies, combined with authoritative and thought-provoking editorial syntheses, to demonstrate how ecological study (often long term), combined with a flexible, interdisciplinary approach, is a consistently effective strategy to tackle the most pressing challenges facing farmers, conservationists, and policy makers today. It is aimed at student and professional academics as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers, both government and non-government.

Summary: Mapping of biological diversity in the cultural landscape of Central Norway.
Volume 1: Integrates more than 30 years of research by the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford to reveal how agricultural systems and wildlife interact, presenting examples from scales varying from microcosm to landscape, individuals to populations, and covering plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, with the purpose of fortifying the evidence base for managing outcomes. It considers the implications of agricultural development for natural habitats, biodiversity, and the provision of essential ecosystem services.
