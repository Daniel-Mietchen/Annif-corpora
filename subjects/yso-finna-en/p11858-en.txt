Recent advances in remote sensing and geoinformation processing for land degradation assessment
Dryland ecosystems support a surprising amount of biodiversity; desertification, however, is a significant land degradation problem in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions of the world. The situation is likely to worsen with high population growth rates and accompanying land-use conflicts. The contributions to this publication, an international scientific conference held under the leadership of UNESCO, address these issues and offer practical solutions for combating desertification along with conserving and sustainably managing dryland ecosystems. This volume documents how improved understanding of drylands provides insight into the health and future prospects of these ecosystems that should help ensure that dryland communities enjoy a sustainable future.--Publisher's description.

"This report reviews the definitions of drought, and the criteria for determining the onset and cessation of agricultural drought ... [and] surveys some of the methods and indices used in monitoring and assessing conditions leading to drought and desertification, and discusses the nature of crop development in arid and semiarid zone agriculture. Practical techniques which use agrometeorological data to aid crop development in arid and semiarid zone agriculture as well as practical techniques for pasture and range management are discussed."

"A comprehensive review of dryland climates and their relationship to the physical environment, hydrology, and inhabitants. Chapters are divided into four major sections on background meteorology and climatology; the nature of dryland climates in relation to precipitation and hydrology; the climatology and climate dynamics of the major dryland regions on each continent; and an extensive review of long-term climate variability in the world's drylands. It includes key topics such as vegetation, geomorphology, desertification, micro-habitats, and adaptation to dryland environments. This interdisciplinary volume provides an extensive review of the primary literature (covering over 2500 references) and the conventional and satellite datasets that form key research tools for dryland climatology. Illustrated with over 100 photographs, it presents a unique view of dryland climates for a broad spectrum of researchers, environmental professionals and advanced students in climatology, meteorology, geography, environment science, earth system science, ecology, hydrology and geomorphology"--
