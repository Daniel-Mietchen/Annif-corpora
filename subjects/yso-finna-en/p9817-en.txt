Despite notable contributions in eyewitness identification and jury selection, most legal research done by psychologists has had a minimal impact upon law and public policy in the US. In this carefully-reasoned and compelling text, the authors explain how psychologists have failed to understand the law and the context in which it operates.
Law and literature
"Networks of Power in Copyright Law considers the challenge of creating a harmonised international market for digital services. Pursuing an interdisciplinary perspective on the question of how copyright law remains restrictive, the book addresses the role of industry representatives, collecting societies and legislative/executive bodies in the development of contemporary digital copyright law. Focusing on the European Union, Benjamin Farrand argues that the harmonisation of copyright law is largely defined by the power relationships between legislative/executive bodies and industry representatives"--

Providing legal analysis and touching upon social history and art history themes, this work offers an objective review of five art trials. Spanning the last 20 years, specific areas of law are examined with each trial: First and Fifth Amendments, copyright law, contract law, evaluation of art and misrepresentation. Art, outside of the legal vacuum, has been embroiled in a battle initiated by social conservatives to promote decency. Three trials involving this struggle and the National Endowment of the Arts are analyzed. The valuation of art is examined in the context of Andy Warhol's estate and copyright law is considered because of the appropriation of contemporary images by Jeff Koons. Although each trial is reviewed distinctly, all are interwoven to present major issues relating to contemporary art. Entertaining aspects of each trial contribute to the education of art and law. For art students, copyright, contract and constitutional analysis in the context of actual hearings is a valuable resource outlining afforded protections and options. To scholars interested in contemporary art and its encounters with the law, this text bridges the gap between two seemingly disparate worlds.

There is a strong relationship between the media and intellectual property. On the one hand, intellectual property goods are created because they are transmitted through the media, on the other hand media can only work by creating goods of intellectual property. The development of media society set before intellectual property law many challenges. Both law practitioners and academics ask whether the law follows the media and their spectacular development, and whether the law meets expectations of media society. The answers to these questions are negative, but fortunately law tries not to be further than a step behind the progress, not only by creating new legal frameworks that meet the needs, but also, and perhaps above all, thanks to the progressive interpretation of traditional legal rules..

"Focusing in particular on legislative initiatives concerning copyright and the internet, this book seeks to explain the reasons why copyright law in the EU has developed in a way perceived to be unduly restrictive yet fundamentally unable to address issues of the territoriality of copyright. Using an inter-disciplinary approach that combines legal analysis with political theory, such as Foucault's Networks of Power and Culpepper's Quiet Politics, Farrand explores how success in lobbying for changes in copyright law is the result of complex network relationships, perceptions of industry expertise, and the comparatively low political importance of copyright reform to the average European citizen. Networks of Power in Digital Copyright Law and Policy: Political Salience, Expertise and the Legislative Process therefore presents an original socio-political theoretical framework for assessing developments in Copyright Law.Written with clarity and new insight, this book will be accessible to those new to the areaa of political theory and EU Law, as well as being eminently suited to researchers and post-graduate students of law and politics"--
Debate about globalization has raised some serious questions about the viability of the state. Jarrod Wiener argues here that there is a danger of making generalizations that the state has lost authority across a range of sovereignty issues. Concentrating on one aspect of sovereignty, that of protective jurisdiction, Wiener examines the USA and the states of the European Union as actors that are highly integrated into transnational practices, and takes international banking, money laundering, and the Internet as case studies. Wiener believes that the challenge to sovereignty from these practices comes from deregulation and liberalization of public policy, with the consequent empowerment of civil society actors who are transnationally mobile. In response, states are pursuing a two-fold strategy to assert control. The first is "domestication", which is the formulation of municipal law to control the activities of individuals and to localize control on the territory of the state. The second process is that of "harmonization" of laws across borders, which standardizes the means of controlling civil society actors.
