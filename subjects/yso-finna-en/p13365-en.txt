What do emotions do? How do emotions move us or get us stuck? In developing a theory of the cultural politics of emotion, Sara Ahmed focuses on the relationship between emotions, language and bodies. She shows how emotions are named in speech acts, as well as how they involve sensations that are felt by the skin. The Cultural Politics of Emotion develops a new methodology for reading "the emotionality of texts" and offers analyses of the role of emotions in debates on international terrorism, asylum and migration, and reconciliation and reparation. New for this edition: an extensive Afterword, "Emotions and Their Objects," which situates the book in relation to the emergent field of affect studies, as well as in relation to the author's body of scholarly work.
