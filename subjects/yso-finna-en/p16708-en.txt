"Designed for graduate students and researchers in the behavioral, social, health, and medical sciences, this text employs generalized linear models, including mixed models, for categorical and limited dependent variables. Categorical variables include both nominal and ordinal variables. Discrete or continuous limited dependent variables have restricted support, whether through censorship or truncation or by their nature. The book incorporates examples of truncated counts, censored continuous variables, and doubly bounded continuous variables, such as percentages. "--

This thesis is a collection of four self-contained essays that discuss time series applications of binary response models. Although popular in microeconometric applications using cross-sectional data, this class of models is not among the most commonly used ones in time series econometrics. Nevertheless, these models hold interesting possibilities to various forecasting issues in empirical macroeconomics and finance. The most common time series application of binary response models, or more specifically probit models, has been recession forecasting. In this context, these models have been applied ever since Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) used them to study U.S. recession periods. The application to recession forecasting is a natural one, due to the binary nature of the dependent variable, as business cycle turning points determine the economy into periods of expansion and recession. An obvious advantage of binary response models over models designed for continuous, real-valued dependent variables is that they provide probability forecasts to decision makers. Due to this convenient property, there are a number of potential applications for these models, where the decision makers are after a yes or no decision. One of these is predicting movements in the direction of asset prices, and basing investment decisions on these predictions. The directional predictability of excess stock market returns has previously been studied by, for example, Leung et al. (2000), Nyberg (2011), and Chevapatrakul (2013) and the findings have been promising when compared with those obtained using traditional methods, such as the conventional predictive regressions. This thesis extends the previous research on both predicting the direction of asset returns (Chapters 2-4) and state of the business cycle (Chapter 5). The most important connection between the essays in this thesis is the use of a common methodology, i.e. the probit model. Along with the new empirical results I also contribute to the previous literature by developing and employing new methods. In Chapter 3, written jointly with Henri Nyberg, we develop a new bivariate probit model allowing for contemporaneous effects. In Chapters 3, 4, and 5, I consider another way to assess the accuracy of probability forecasts, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve that was originally developed for radar signal detection.

The concept of Wiener chaos generalizes to an infinite-dimensional setting the properties of orthogonal polynomials associated with probability distributions on the real line. It plays a crucial role in modern probability theory, with applications ranging from Malliavin calculus to stochastic differential equations and from probabilistic approximations to mathematical finance. This book is concerned with combinatorial structures arising from the study of chaotic random variables related to infinitely divisible random measures. The combinatorial structures involved are those of partitions of finite sets, over which Mobius functions and related inversion formulae are defined. This combinatorial standpoint (which is originally due to Rota and Wallstrom) provides an ideal framework for diagrams, which are graphical devices used to compute moments and cumulants of random variables. Several applications are described, in particular, recent limit theorems for chaotic random variables. An Appendix presents a computer implementation in MATHEMATICA for many of the formulae.

The current volume, Advances in Latent Variable Mixture Models, contains chapters by all of the speakers who participated in the 2006 Cilvr conference, providing not just a snapshot of the event, but more importantly chronicling the state of the art in latent variable mixture model research. The volume starts with an overview chapter by the Cilvr conference keynote speaker, Bengt Muthén, offering a “lay of the land” for latent variable mixture models before the volume moves to more specific constellations of topics. Part I, Multilevel and Longitudinal Systems, deals with mixtures for data that are hierarchical in nature either due to the data's sampling structure or to the repetition of measures (of varied types) over time. Part Ii, Models for Assessment and Diagnosis, addresses scenarios for making judgments about individuals' state of knowledge or development, and about the instruments used for making such judgments. Finally, Part Iii, Challenges in Model Evaluation, focuses on some of the methodological issues associated with the selection of models most accurately representing the processes and populations under investigation. It should be stated that this volume is not intended to be a first exposure to latent variable methods. Readers lacking such foundational knowledge are encouraged to consult primary and/or secondary didactic resources in order to get the most from the chapters in this volume. Once armed with the basic understanding of latent variable methods, we believe readers will find this volume incredibly exciting.

"This book is devoted to dependent variables other than those for which linear regression is appropriate. The authors argue that such dependent variables are, if anything, more common throughout the human sciences than the kind that suit linear regression. Presenting a broader but unified coverage in which the authors attempt to integrate concepts and ideas shared across models and types of data broader but unified coverage in which we attempt to integrate the concepts and ideas shared across models and types of data, especially regarding conceptual links between discrete and continuous limited dependent variables"--
