The objective of this thesis was to conduct a thorough Business-to-Business market research of three selected target markets in China on Finnish language study material for the commissioning company-- Finn Lectura Oy. The main research question was to find out who forms the current market for Finnish language study material in China, which was broken down to four sub-questions to answer for a better understanding of the market situation.    The theoretical framework was built based on PESTLE, Porter's Five-force model, SWOT, marketing mix and B-to-B buying situation and process; a conceptual model was also designed by the author through analyzing the mentioned theories mostly from Kotler, Armstrong, Keller, Hollensen, Jobber, Blythe & Zimmerman, Brennan, Can-ning and McDowell.    The primary research part was carried out in the form of structured telephone interviews. Twelve interviews in total were conducted with staff members from relevant departments at existing and potential B-to-B customers during two separate phases due to the Chinese school winter holidays. The B-to-B customers are universities, schools, language training centers and book stores.    The results revealed that China is a young market for Finnish language material currently with great potentials. Since the supply has been very scarce in the market, and the demand on the other hand keeps growing at a rapid pace, Finn Lectura Oy, if willing to be the first “mover”, should be able to take over the majority of the market share.    In conclusion, this could be a good opportunity for Finn Lectura Oy to start contacting with the listed B-to-B customers in China and at the same time working out a strategic marketing plan in order to gain most of the sales in the Chinese market through the first entry.

Traditional fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline have been dominating the transport fuel industry for decades. However in a situation where policies and agreements on reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy are made, it is likely that sustainable sources of energy will be increasing their market share, eventually completely or partly replacing fossil energy sources. The commissioner of this thesis operates a local biogas plant. The plant processes organic waste to produce biogas which can be refined into a transport fuel. The commissioner is planning on starting commercial distribution of biogas as a transport fuel in the year 2016. The aim of this thesis was to study and analyze the overall market conditions of biogas as transport fuel and provide recommendations on what marketing activities should be implemented by the commissioner. Thesis was made by conducting a secondary research using the available written sources and the access to industry knowledge acquired by of the commissioner. The marketing recommendations were made after conducting multiple strategic analyses, applying theory of B2B marketing, and taking notice of the realities and resources of a relatively small company. As a conclusion of this study, the commissioner was recommended to implement organized personal selling activities with the support of well-designed owned, earned and paid media. Relationship marketing practices should be implemented in order to maximize customer retention. The overall strategy of how and where to sell the product should be precisely decided, and some strategic insight and findings which were made during the research process are also presented in the report.

With the ever increasing online community and opportunities, digital marketing is fast becoming the mainstream in the field of marketing. At the same time marketers have to be up-to-date with the current digital trends in order to be able to improve themselves and make valuable contributions to their organisations. The significance of digital marketing thus should make any thoughtful organisation want to plan for, perform, evaluate and improve its digital marketing endeavours where necessary, in order to take advantage of the opportunities available. This importance therefore necessitated this research. This thesis was commissioned by Koodiviidakko Oy, a Finnish company producing digital marketing software. The focus of this research is on business to business digital marketing in a digitally emerging market, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the case study. A broad literature review of the concept of business to business (B2B) was performed, touching on aspects such as organisational buying behaviour, decision making unit and relationship marketing. Also discussed was B2B marketing communications from two dimensions; channel and relationship. Furthermore, the report examined the concepts of content marketing, digital marketing and digital marketing channels which are important concepts relevant to the thesis subject matter. The research was both qualitative and quantitative with analytical tools used to gather statistical data on the commissioner's digital marketing channels. The results gathered from the research showed that the commissioner's digital marketing efforts in the UAE are on the right track but more needs to be done especially in the areas of customer acquisition, customer conversion and measuring return on investments. Finally, based on the findings, recommendations were made, that the commissioner could employ in order to improve its digital marketing.

This bachelor's thesis is a study into the implications that social media have on business-to-business marketing communications and customer relationship development. It starts off from the observation that traditional marketing and communications are currently facing a transitional phase, as the new paradigm for relationship marketing in electronic media has introduced a competitive model for interactive and collaborative communication. In that regard, the thesis frames the research questions by integrating theory from the relationship marketing perspective of value-driven buyer-seller relationships with social media marketing communication aspects. Although there is still a shortage of academic research and proven practice on the research topic, this study aims to showcase current efforts to generate knowledge on relationship marketing communication in social media, with a particular emphasis on business-to-business markets. The central goal of this thesis is to provide the case company, Dimedia Oy, with a model that integrates the development of marketing relationships with marketing communication practice in social media, and thus encourages it into entering the social media space. The contribution solves the problem by showing that the characteristics of social media add another layer to marketing communications, which needs to be treated differently compared to traditional marketing efforts. In addition, the study suggests that by building a roadmap for social media engagement, organizations can create a social media marketing communications strategy that matches their current expertise, comfort level, and available resources. Successful implementation of this strategy can increase the quality and frequency of interaction with customers, and build relationships with prospects much earlier in the purchasing cycle as well as in all of the phases of relationship development. The analysis leading to this contribution is done in three steps over the course of three chapters. The first of these steps consist providing a theoretical background by covering the basics, strategy, and the business-to-business side of relationship marketing, marketing communications, and social media. The second step offers a more practical perspective to the study by combining important aspects of theory with practice in relation to the role of social media in business-to-business marketing communications and customer relationship development. To counter the current trends described in the first and second parts, the third step of the thesis develops a possible approach by providing the case company with a practical social media policy document as well as elements and recommended procedures for creating and enforcing social media policies and strategies for its customers.
Now in its sixth edition, Digital Marketing: Strategy, Implementation and Practice provides comprehensive, practical guidance on how companies can get the most out of digital media and technology to meet their marketing goals. Digital Marketing links marketing theory with practical business experience through case studies and interviews from cutting edge companies such as eBay and Facebook, to help students understand digital marketing in the real world. Readers will learn best practice frameworks for developing a digital marketing strategy, plus success factors for key digital marketing techniques including search marketing, conversion optimisation and digital communications using social media including Twitter and Facebook.
The primary objective of the thesis was to analyze how FeedbackDialog Oy could increase its market position in Finland from branding point of view. A focus on marketing communication as a tool to create brand equity was chosen. As a result, the research problem was settled: How to build brand equity though marketing communications in B2B market? In order to solve the formulated research problem, theory about brand equity and marketing communication in B2B market were used to back up the application. Brand equity resulted from the interaction of both brand awareness and brand image to bring the strong, favourable, and unique associations to customers. Marketing communications was the tool to deliver the desired message to customers through various modes in regard of brand equity creation and enhancement. The method selected to provide a valid and reliable answer was deductive. The empirical study was conducted in qualitative research by interviewing company managers and customers. The interviews were face-to-face in which the interviewees answered open-ended questions. Findings from the qualitative study revealed that FeedbackDialog Oy brand equity was relatively quite low in Finnish market. Marketing communications were immature while integrity should be developed as well as messages should be enriched. The conducted study analyzed the impact of marketing communications as a tool to create brand equity. Based on the research FeedbackDialog Oy should consider to strengthen information delivered in marketing communications and broaden marketing communication modes. This would improve the market position and benefit branding for FeedbackDialog.

The purpose of this paper was to discover the best segment in the business market for Optimal Performance Oy to target their wellness services, and to create a low-budget marketing communications plan with the most suitable marketing channels and best advertising strategy for this segment. Using literature sources, the theoretical part of the paper explains the concepts relevant to the topic in areas of services, segmentation, business-to-business marketing and marketing communications.  Theme interviews with HR-managers were the basis for the primary research. Combining theory with the results from the interviews indicated that large intellectual-capital companies are the most interested in wellness programs and that a personal communication is the most optimal communication channel considering the budget. Accordingly, a marketing communications plan was drafted. The paper also includes further suggestions that go beyond the communication plan. Among other things, it is suggested that in order to differentiate itself from competitors, Optimal Performance should constantly analyze and follow up on their local competitors.

The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: Who is the audience when a company is sharing information in social media? Is it only the friends of owners and workers, old clients, or is there a chance to obtain new clients and business contacts through these media? Another problem to be addressed is the question of what types of information or content a media agency should produce and share that would attract potential clients. This thesis is a case study and the case company is a small Out Of Home Media planning and buying agency called MacDonald Media, located in the United States. The theoretical part of this thesis concentrates on the different forms of Social Media, how the Internet has changed from a marketing point of view, and what kinds of previous research have been conducted on this subject. Other important elements include discussing what makes Business-to-Business more challenging for Social Media marketing and why personal sales are extremely important for B-to-B. The research portion of this thesis consists of qualitative research based on e-mail interviews with MacDonald Media's West Coast GM Rick Robinson and a phone interview with Johanna Janhonen, a Finnish Social Media specialist. My own observations during an internship with MacDonald Media have also influenced the research section. When analyzing the data, I tried to find connections between these two interviews to answer the research problem and to discover how companies were already using Social Media. I also tried to find connections between these interviews and my theoretical conclusions, e.g. that Social Media marketing is not as simple for B-to-B as it is for B-to-C companies. The results show that it is difficult for B-to-B companies to directly find new client contacts through Social Media. Though there are advantages, including an improved ease to connect people, share knowledge and information, and build and protect a company brand. LinkedIn and Twitter appear to be the best forums for a Business-to-Business company like MacDonald Media to be visible in the online world.

Branding the company : The importance of branding in industrial markets
The environment in marketing communications of any business is constantly changing and developing. New technological advancements, globalization, the Internet and others communication channels open new paths for business marketers. Consumer marketing has many opportunities to reach audience via media for example. In business-to-business marketing the rules are quite different and noise surrounding the messaging is difficult to recognize and block. Company X provides industrial and municipal solutions in both domestic and global markets. There are varieties of communications strategies available which is why I saw this as an opportunity to learn about something that is very current and valuable for the company. Though the company has many successful strategies already existing, I wanted to come up with some new ideas. Web Medias are the trendiest channels in current business and knowledge on that are is quite narrow. This is why the main focus in this thesis surrounds the web environment. The future IMC implementations of Company X are also discussed. The literature review is collected from web sources that tend to be more up to date and books provided by local libratory and online archives. Also, a research case study was conducted in order to evaluate the current online visibility of the company.

The commissioner of this thesis is Prorink International, a company specialized in products and services required for sporting and recreational ice areas. The objective of this thesis is to find suitable ways for SMEs, the commissioner in particular, to develop their marketing and to become more international. The marketing part was the author’s idea and the commissioners wish was to also help them become more international. The theoretical part consists of marketing and internationalization theories, provided by acknowledged professionals on their fields. First, marketing principles are discussed and some attention is also given to B2B marketing, which is the market the commissioner operates in. The marketing theories are followed by internationalization and international marketing principles. The last theoretical part deals with marketing communication and distribution strategies. Desktop research was used in making the theoretical framework. The outcome of this thesis is recommendations for the commissioner on how to improve their marketing and what needs to be considered when becoming more international. This thesis suggests the commissioner some useful marketing activities to use on daily basis. In addition, this thesis provides the commissioner and readers with useful theories on marketing and internationalization. As a conclusion, the recommendations are there for the commissioner to work as a guideline and are mainly to be used for the ice paints but they can be easily modified and used to other products as well. There might be some issues in taking the recommendations into action due to lack of resources, even though they are chosen to suit an SME. As for development suggestions a business plan would be something very useful for the company and the commissioner could get OUAS students to do that for them.
Messages are conveyed by various digital tools including the website, search engines, email, and social media, consistently emphasizing the firms online value proposition of using its expertise in modern technology to suggest the most suitable solutions for its clients and perform qualified services.

Moving from B2C Markets to B2B Markets to Increase Competitiveness
The commissioner of this thesis, ebrand Suomi Oy, is a digital media agency possessing significant ability and knowledge of social media but they have trouble communicating this value for the customers even though they have a good presence in social media. The objective of this thesis is to develop a proper social media marketing communications plan for ebrand Suomi Oy, which could eventually be turned into a product package that the commissioner could offer to customers. Even though social media is becoming more important in people's daily lives, the main emphasis has been on the consumer side, which is why it is very relevant and timely to consider social media marketing communications from a B2B perspective. The theoretical section consists of the basic concepts of marketing before focusing on how to deliver value to customers via relationship marketing and integrated marketing communications, after which, social media marketing is discussed. Supported by this theory, the actions required of ebrand Suomi Oy to improve their marketing communications on each of the chosen social media channels will be presented. The research methods are qualitative and desktop research was applied when the theoretical background was conducted while using highly topical references. The final result of this thesis is a social media marketing communications plan. It will provide the means to become a thought leader in the industry while generating leads and building stronger relationships with current and future customers. The thesis also examines the somewhat unfamiliar aspect of social media in B2B use and provides insight on why social media is just as efficient in B2B use, as it is in the consumer industry.The plan might prove slightly difficult for ebrand to follow, as they might not possess the required resources to fully implement it. A recommendation considering this problem has been made to hire internships to provide content and monitor the efficiency of the plan. To aid in the implementation of the plan, a year clock of activities was composed which should prove useful when implementing the plan. It should be noted that with slight alterations, this marketing communications plan can be utilised for both B2C and B2B companies.

The research aims to build brand for a small-sized company namely CoreFinland Ltd. Herein, the main objective of this research is to create CoreFinland as a brand in b-to-b customers' context. This broader milestone is achieved by studying the case company's brand identity and brand image issues. The first part of this research makes a comparative study of varieties of relevant literature from different writers. The theories discuss b-to-b brand relevance and extend to the major study areas: brand identity and brand image. This is a qualitative research, carried out by using semi-structured interviews with the company personnel in order to find out the brand identity and with the business customers to reveal the current com-pany image. The revealed image is contrasted with the identity and, finally, a suitable identity for the company is suggested. The study reveals that the company's brand image among the customers corresponds only moderately with the company's brand identity because of lack of brand communi-cation, an insufficient product range and insufficient customer care. Further, the research suggests a suitable brand identity by considering customers' perceptions and the company objectives. The study reveals that CoreFinland's core identity needs to be related to its organizational associations of being healthy and environmentally friendly, and service associations of having professional and friendly customer care, and quick and effective delivery. In addition, its extended identity needs to be a young and dynamic Finnish company with healthy and luxurious products, passionate workers and having a good contact with retailers and wholesalers.  The findings of this study allow CoreFinland to understand its current company image and provide valuable insights to the company to create a suitable brand identity.

Combining e-mail marketing with telemarketing in B2B direct marketing : case study: EcoTelematics and NaviFleet
The objective of this thesis is to find pros and cons for combining e-mail marketing with telemarketing in business-to-business direct marketing. This topic is current because more and more businesses want to properly use this combination but have no skills of doing it successfully. One of the example company is EcoTelematics Group, for whom this thesis has been written for. However, due to the general level of the content other businesses struggling with the same issues can find help from it as well. The research started with understanding fully the concepts behind e-mail marketing and telemarketing. It was important to study them in separate in order to formulate an accurate research framework. Additionally, it was also noticed that not many studies about this specific combination have been conducted in the past. This leads to the fact that, whatever the outcome of this thesis will be, it will provide something new to the area of direct marketing. The actual research was done by conducting qualitative in-depth interviews. There were 10 of them in total and the interviewees were divided into 2 separate groups. First, the company side or the sender side (like called in this thesis) was interviewed in order to understand why they use the combination of e-mail marketing and telemarketing. Nevertheless, this was not enough because the opinions of the customers or receivers (like called in this thesis) were crucial for the success of the combination. Due to this reason, both of the sides were interviewed for comprehending the process of sending and receiving e-mails and telemarketing calls. The outcomes of this thesis were interesting. The company side and the customer side (or senders and receivers) agreed on many things, like the shortness of the e-mail messages and telemarketing calls and the effectiveness of the combination, but there were many found differences as well. The order of the process was most likely to be the biggest, because companies preferred to start with e-mail and then continue with telemarketing, whereas customers liked being contacted first by phone and then receive e-mail.

Nowadays, digital solutions and social online interaction are commonly used for educational purposes. One of the pioneers who offers modern and innovative solutions for e-learning is Finnish company HappyWise Ltd. based in Oulu. Due to low resources and lack of know-how HappyWise Ltd needs support to the planning of marketing activities and therefore the authors implemented marketing plan for which market research about their e-learning programme HappyWise Trainer was conducted. Hence, the main aspect is marketing plan which includes various analyses e.g. about macro environment and competitors. Marketing mix will be outlined through 4 P’s: product, place, price and promotion. Based on these, marketing communications plan is discussed and recommendations are presented. Unfortunately the market research was unsuccessful resulting from practical part which is discussed more specifically later in this thesis. However, the marketing plan was successfully completed with the support of theoretical framework. Forthcoming step to HappyWise is to concentrate on essential marketing activities and consider having position in personnel focusing only on this.
The purpose of this thesis was to create an integrated marketing communications plan. The thesis was made for a Finnish consulting company which is specialized on project-, risk- and quality management in different industries in Finland and abroad. The past advertising has relied on relationships with former cooperation partners and the objective of the study is to define what kind of integrated marketing communications plan the enterprise in question needs when aiming to increase customer awareness and enhance the current corporate identity. Hence, the study focuses on situation analysis and the actual IMC program including the suggested advertising- and promotional tools. In addition, sketched plans were created for a logo, business card and website layout of the company. A qualitative method was chosen for the empirical part of the study. The data was collected by using unstructur ed interviews and various sources of the industrial field in question to ensure the practicability of the final outcome. This thesis had two outcomes. It provides feasible ideas and a theoretical framework about the subject for the case company and offers a draft of new visual corporate identity. However, the final decisions and execution are left for the company as they are dependent of company's preferences and resources.
