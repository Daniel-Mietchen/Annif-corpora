Technology review
The objective of this paper was to explore the subject of forestry partners programs, a type of wood supply resource to the pulp mills in Brazil, and its impact on the cost of eucalyptus wood, i.e. which changes did it cause in the cost of eucalyptus wood to the pulp mill, whether the wood coming from the programs are of a lower cost or more expensive to the mill and the influence of land charges in the cost of the wood. The second objective was to identify the reasons for the migration of the pulp producing companies to the Southern Hemisphere. The third objective was to verify the trend in use of forestry partners programs by the pulp mills in Brazil. The theoretical background for this research consist of Michael Porter's Five Competitive Forces Model, for addressing the competitive environment of the pulp and paper industry, and Porter's Three Generic Strategies of Competitive Advantage to provide the foundation for the analysis of the cost components of paper and pulp manufacturing in different regions in the world, the eucalyptus wood cost components and its competitiveness as a fiber resource for pulp production, and the cost competitiveness of forestry partners programs in the supply of eucalyptus wood for pulp manufacturing. Primary data was collected through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with three experts in the pulp and paper industry, from Pöyry Forest Industry Consulting, and through open, self-administered questionnaires, sent to three experts of the Brazilian forest sector: one professor of forestry at the University of São Paulo, one responsible for the forestry partners programs at the world's leading exporter of market pulp, Aracruz Celulose, and one responsible for the forestry partners programs at Brazil's largest paper and paperboard producer, Klabin. The results of this study show an increasingly important role of fast-growing plantations for the supply of wood to the pulp and paper industry due to its cost competitiveness, which justifies the growing presence of pulp producing companies in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Latin America. The study indicates that the wood derived from forestry partners programs come at a cheaper cost to the mill, than the wood grown in the mill's own plantations. The biggest advantage of forestry partners programs to the pulp mill is, however, the non-mobilization of capital in land. The trend in the use of forestry partners programs is moving upwards, as pulp and paper companies in Brazil seek to enlarge the percentage of wood deriving from the programs to an average of about 20% by the next few years.
