"Prince of Networks is the first treatment of Bruno Latour specifically as a philosopher. Part One covers four key works that display Latours underrated contributions to metaphysics ... Harman contends that Latour is one of the central figures of contemporary philosophy, with a highly original ontology centered in four key concepts: actants, irreduction, translation, and alliance. In Part Two, Harman summarizes Latours most important philosophical insights, including his status as the first secular occasionalist. Working from his own object-oriented perspective, Harman also criticizes the Latourian focus on the relational character of actors at the expense of their cryptic autonomous reality."--Book cover.
