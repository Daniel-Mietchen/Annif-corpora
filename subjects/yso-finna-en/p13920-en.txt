The goal of this thesis was to develop an automatic resistance tester for Nokia Oyj component quality control. The work is mainly focused on reprogramming a programmable logic controller, introduction of an OPC server and development of a new user interface using LabVIEW-programming tool. The device was developed using an existing device that had its functions modified to match its new purpose. By examining the old program code inside the programmable logic controller, a new I/O list was made. It was used to make a new program for the motion control. To operate the device a new user interface was programmed. In the design of the new user interface special attention was paid to user-friendliness. Finally, the communication between a computer and a PLC was in focus. For communication an OPC server was introduced. As a result of the project a device was developed that could automatically measure the resistance of components from points that are taught in advance. The teaching of these points is done manually or by compiling the points picked from a CAD file into a comprehensible format for motion controller. After the device was built, there was no need to measure circuit boards manually. This thesis does not have any confidential information concerning the procedures of quality control.

This thesis was done for Wärtsilä Finland Ltd. The purpose of this thesis is to describe Wärtsilä 50 dual fuel engine?s automation systems in the gas commissioning phase of the power plant. This thesis is used as a work instruction for commissioning engineers. W50 dual fuel engine is an engine that can be operated with multiple fuel types. These are light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil and natural gas. In this work is concentrated on running the engine with natural gas. The quality of the natural gas has a great impact on performance and on the output of the engine. Engine automation system is used to achieve safe operation of the engine and to make the engine more easily predictable for maintenance. Implementing changes to engine running values is used to achieve efficiently operating power plant. Completed thesis includes a comprehensive content of commissioning the engine automation system.

The purpose of this thesis is to define an Intelligent Milking System as a modern technology and innovation in the dairy farming that allows farmers to use computerized machines to do diversified activities regarding their dairy cattle management and productions systems. This thesis will explain why Kenya should adopt the use of this milking system in its dairy sector. In addition, it will explore how this system works in a typical dairy farm and highlight important considerations that will ensure farmers get high quality services and products. Moreover, it will present the importance of using milking machines in the dairy sector and how this has changed the lives of farmers, their animals and dependants. The paper will describe two Finnish case studies where Intelligent Milking System (IMS) has been successfully embraced. It will also highlight the significance of adopting this practice by the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) to boost milk production quality and quantity in Kenya. Lastly, it will present recommendations on how this method can be improved to ensure there is a maximum profit generation, reduced costs and improved quality and quantity of milk supply.
