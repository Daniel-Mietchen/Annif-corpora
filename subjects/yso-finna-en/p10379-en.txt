This study is a research work that focuses on Small and Medium sized Enterprises that are considering  implementing an Intranet system. The primary objective is to illuminate an intranet solution for  ChaguaIT.  Based on the assumption that the subscriber is new to intranet use, an introductory chapter on Intranet is explained, therefore providing a base platform for the reader to have a clear understanding on the importance of intranet use in today's business processes. The study discusses the various solutions free and commercial with intent of recommending the most suitable for ChaguaIT.  It further examines the case where by it evaluates the needs of the subscriber and correlate with the  readily available solutions. By so doing it recommends a course of action to meet the company demands. A trial version of the ideal solution was put to test and feedback collected through questionnaire was analyzed. The result of the study clearly showed that SME's could now reap the benefits formally realized only by large big spending corporations. This is as a result of the availability  and technological breakthroughs that have allowed for credible in-expensive solutions.
