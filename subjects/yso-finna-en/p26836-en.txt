In this presentation the possibilities to improve  facility management by monitoring is introduced  based on case studies on the district-level operation  center of the city of Kuopio and Aalto University  Otaniemi - campus area in the city of Espoo. Also  guidance options of public authorities are introduced  the advanced role of BSO (Building Supervision  Office), city of Oulu, Finland as example. In the  presentation the attention is paid also how one can  convert from the big mass of data the useful  information for stakeholders.
