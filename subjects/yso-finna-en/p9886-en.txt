"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)

Determinants of adult psychomotor speed : a study of monozygotic twins
This book reflects a harmonious relationship between the academic world and the European brewing industry. Despite the fact that they appear to be driven by divergent perspectives, they both agree that ignorance may lead to prejudice. Assumptions made about alcohol, and beer in particular, are often based on media coverage, cultural stereotypes and even myths, without any relevant in depth scientific analysis. ERAB: The European Foundation for Alcohol Research (ERAB) is proud to provide a step forward to enhance the knowledge of the effects of beer and alcohol on the body and the brain as well as the analysis of the best strategies to reduce, in the short and long term, the possible damage induced by its use. The beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption in terms of cardiovascular disease together with the detrimental effect in terms of cancer, lead to the assumption that consumption must be evaluated personally, taking into account the contextual environment, the global body state and the consensual pleasure arising from its consumption.
