Explanation and understanding
Kant's critique of reason denied knowledge in order to make room for faith. Animated above all by F. H. Jacobi, the relationship of faith to reason is renewed as a central theme in post-Kantian philosophy. At stake are questions of whether faith can be the foundation of knowledge; whether faith marks the bounds of reason; and whether reason, posited absolutely, supersedes faith. The contributions to volume 7 of the Internationales Jahrbuch des Deutschen Idealismus / International Yearbook of German Idealism investigate from various perspectives the complex relation of faith to reason in post-Kantian philosophy and philosophy of religion.

An introductory guide to the work of Judith Butler, a major contemporary theorist, this title includes a new interview with Butler. "Judith Butler: Live Theory" is an invaluable introduction to the work of this key contemporary theorist, guiding the student through the most complex ideas of one of the most influential thinkers in contemporary culture. Concise, accessible and comprehensive, the book explores and illuminates Butler's important and ongoing contributions to gender theory, offers new insights into the central themes of her work, and considers the extent of her impact on how the discipline of gender studies has been shaped. In particular, the book considers Butler's intellectual work in relation to issues of sexuality and performance, identity and politics, language and power - themes central to Butler's thought and writing. Vicki Kirby locates Butler in the context of contemporary theorists and thinkers and the book includes a new interview with Butler herself, in which she discusses the key themes in her work as well as future writing plans. Offering a stimulating and clear account of the work and thought of this inspiring figure, "Judith Butler: Live Theory" is a key resource for anyone studying this pioneering thinker within the context of sociology, cultural studies, literary criticism, feminism and philosophy.
