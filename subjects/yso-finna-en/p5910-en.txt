hunting tourism
"'A critical and unique contribution to the study of nature conservation'-Professor Steven Brechin, Syracuse University" "The perilous state of endangered species such as tigers and rhinos, and the worldwide illegal trade in ivory, diamonds, bushmeat and many other rare and valuable commodities, are familiar issues in the West. The heroes in these narratives are those who work to create protected areas for wildlife; the villains the shadowy poachers and smugglers who destroy endangered animals and their habitats for the sake of profit." "In this groundbreaking book, Rosaleen Duffy argues that the story is much more complex than this. She analyses the workings of the black-market wildlife industry, pointing out that illegal trading is often the direct result of Western consumer desires, from coltan for mobile phones to caviar for the global elite. She looks at how tourists contribute, often unwittingly, to the destruction of natural environments. Most strikingly, she argues that the imperatives of Western-style conservation often result in serious injustice to local people, who are at risk of losing not only heir land but sometimes even their lives." "The result of many years of first-hand research, this book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the complex realities of nature conservation."--BOOK JACKET.
