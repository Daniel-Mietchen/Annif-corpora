The greening of everyday life' develops a distinctive new way of talking about environmental concerns in post-industrial society. It brings together several conceptual frameworks with a diversity of case studies and practical examples of efforts to orient everyday material practices toward greater sustainability. The volume builds upon internal criticisms of dominant strands of contemporary environmentalism in post-industrial societies, and develops a new approach which emerges from a number of disciplines, but is unified by a normative concern for the material objects and practices familiar to members of societies in their everyday lives. In exploring alternatives, the chapter authors utilize conceptual frameworks rooted in environmental justice, new materialism, and social practice theory and apply it to the everyday; attention to urban biodiversity, infrastructure for storm water run-off, green home remodelling, household toxicity, community gardens and farmers markets, bicycling and automobility, alternative technologies, and more. With contributions from leading international and emerging scholars, this volume critically explores specific strategies and actions taken to generate homes, communities, and livelihoods that might be scaled-up to promote more sustainable societies.
"Through a combination of innovation and regulation, the script for how the world's economies operate is being totally rewritten. Cleaner and greener technologies are playing an increasing role in global business -- and while there will be costs involved adapting to those technologies, there are also opportunities for business which are capable of commercializing them.From carbon capture to new sources of renewable energy, the overall potential of this shift is enormous, as evidenced by the amount of private capital and public funds looking for clean technologies in which to invest.Clean Tech, Clean Profits is designed as a practical guide for entrepreneurs, innovators and investors on how to bring clean technologies to market in the most effective and profitable manner. It covers topics such as funding clean tech, renewable power generation, clean energy in emerging economies, intellectual property for clean tech, geo-engineering, the shift to low carbon vehicles, waste management, technology challenges, innovation opportunities, and wind, marine, solar and biomass energy.Emphasizing the specific steps that can be taken now in reviewing options, drawing up plans, upgrading a process, writing a specification, or making an investment, this book is ideal for leaders of organizations who want to move ahead of their competitors and offer new sources of value to their customer"--

Reducing your carbon emissions in an economic down-turn can be challenging, but saving the planet doesn't have to cost you more. Tough economic times need not relegate concerns for the planet to the back burner. The author is an environmental economist trying to live a low-carbon life in London. He worked for 15 years in the UK's Office of Climate Change, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit and the Department of the Environment. So far so good. But he has kids. A family to visit in India. A hectic job. In distilling and building on his own experience of trying to live a low carbon life, he helps us navigate the choices that confront us all - families, singletons, pensioners - when making decisions about what to eat, what to buy, how to travel and how to keep warm in the era of climate change and economic turmoil. He works out the sums and lets us know which choices will make the biggest difference, and which are false savings.His book is an irreverent but seriously rigorous reference guide to low-cost, low-carbon living for everyone - in any location - in tough times. It's brimming with up-to-date information on current and future technologies, tips and ideas for every budget on how to spend the least for the biggest carbon reduction gain and insight from the experiences of people trying to live low-carbon lives.

The business case for acting sustainably is becoming increasingly compelling - reducing our global footprint to sustainable levels is the defining issue of our times and it is one that can only be addressed with the active participation of the private sector. However, persuading well established organizations to act in new ways is never easy. This book is designed to support business leaders and organizational scholars who are grappling with this challenge by pulling together leading edge insights from some of the world's best researchers as to how organizational change in general - and sustainable change in particular - can be most effectively managed. The book begins by laying out the economic case for change, while subsequent chapters describe how leaders at firms such as Du Pont, IBM and Cemex have transformed their organizations, exploring issues such as the role of the senior team and the ways in which firms shift their identities, build innovative cultures and processes, and begin to change the world around them. Business leaders will find the book a source of both powerful examples and immediately actionable ideas, while scholars will be deeply intrigued by the insights that emerge from the cross cutting exploration of one of the toughest challenges our society has ever faced.

Carbon governance, climate change and business transformation
Green growth based on forests - new wooden products and construction : Joensuu Forestry Networking Week 2012 : final report
The "green" or environmental sustainability movement has taken hold throughout the world. Its staying power is confirmed by the fact that environmental emphasis in organizations did not decrease during the recent global recession, but rather increased. Organizations see that greater environmental emphasis in their product and service offerings not only helps their image, but also may reduce inefficiency, waste, and corresponding cost. However, since most organizations rely heavily on their supply base for providing components, materials, and services that become part of their final products, organizations must revisit their sourcing processes and choices to have a real impact on the environment.
How to identify green-washing in a green marketing strategy
This book examines the key legal and business aspects of sustainability in depth.Recognizing the firm's need for integrated approaches to law and sustainability as well as adaptive goal setting, the book unites scholars from environmental law, energy, risk regulation and intellectual property. Most firms now recognize that global resources are finite and will grow increasingly scarce.They acknowledge that their actions have social, economic and environmental consequences. Some firms now practice 'whole life-cycle' analysis in marketing and product design, seek sustainable inputs and energy sources, and track and report sustainability performance overall, however it can be measured. But standard practices have not kept pace.Regulators must support such efforts with mandatory structures for all firms enabling leaders to gain competitive advantages and laggards to pay the price.The variety of regulatory tools has grown to include cooperative funding, intellectual property rights, information disclosures, and other means.And that variety is most urgently needed in transition economies where the forces of international competition can be the strongest.The chapters in this book push beyond the traditional boundaries separating these dimensions of law, business and sustainability to offer both practical insights and directions for future research in this immense and growing nexus.

"Transformation to a low carbon economy is a central tenet to any discussion on the solutions to the complex challenges of climate change and energy security. Despite advances in policy, carbon management and continuing development of clean technology, fundamental business transformation has not occurred because of multiple political, economic, social and organisational issues. Carbon Governance, Climate Change and Business Transformation is based on leading academic and industry input, and three international workshops focused on low carbon transformation in leading climate policy jurisdictions (Canada, USA and the UK) under the international Carbon Governance Project (CGP) banner. The book pulls insights from this innovative collaborative network to identify the policy combinations needed to create transformative change. It explores fundamental questions about how governments and the private sector conceptualize the problem of climate change, the conditions under which business transformation can genuinely take place and key policy and business innovations needed. Broadly, the book is based on emerging theories of multi-levelled, multi-actor carbon governance, and applies these ideas to the real world implications for tackling climate change through business transformation. Conceptually and empirically, this book stimulates both academic discussion and practical business models for low carbon transformation"--
