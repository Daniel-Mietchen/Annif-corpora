Abstract: Pulse radars are the most common type of radar used because of its versatility and abilities in function. This thesis will be covered from the viewpoint of military and civilian aviation. The thesis will concentrate on the basics of pulse radars and its function. The structure of the pulse radar will be covered in more detail, and also the most common mathematical formulas in radar  technology.  The function of a secondary surveillance radar (SSR) will also be covered in more detail. The purpose of this thesis is to give a basic understanding of radar  technology and pulse radars.
Based on the classic "Radar Range-Performance Analysis" from 1980, this volume extends that work to ensure applicability of radar equations to the design and analysis of modern radars. It helps engineers to identify what information on the radar and its environment is needed to predict detection range.
