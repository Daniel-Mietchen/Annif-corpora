Anarchy works : examples of anarchist ideas in practice
This book takes examples from around the world, picking through history and anthropology, showing that people have, in different ways and at different times, demonstrated mutual aid, self-organization, autonomy, horizontal decision making, and so forth--the principles that anarchy is founded on - regardless of whether they called themselves anarchists or not.
