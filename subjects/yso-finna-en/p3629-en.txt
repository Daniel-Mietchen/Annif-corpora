Rudolph's pediatrics
"This third edition of Introductory Maternity and Pediatric Nursing reflects the underlying philosophy of love, caring, and support for the childbearing woman, the child, and the families of these individuals. The content has been developed according to the most current information available. In this text, we recognize that cultural sensitivity and awareness are important aspects of caring for the childbearing and child-rearing families. We also recognize that many children and pregnant women live in families other than traditional two-parent family homes and therefore refer to teaching and supporting the childbearing clients and family caregivers of children in all situations and family structures"--Provided by publisher.
