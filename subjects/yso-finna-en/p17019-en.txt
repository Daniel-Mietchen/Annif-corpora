aThis book presents contemporary information on mutagenesis in plants and its applications in plant breeding and research. The topics are classified into sections focusing on the concepts, historical development and genetic basis of plant mutation breeding (chapters 1-6); mutagens and induced mutagenesis (chapters 7-13); mutation induction and mutant development (chapters 14-23); mutation breeding (chapters 24-34); or mutations in functional genomics (chapters 35-41). This book is an essential reference for those who are conducting research on mutagenesis as an approach to improving or modifying a trait, or achieving basic understanding of a pathway for a trait.

Chlorinated hydroxyfuranones : studies on their mutagenicity and molecular mechanism of action
"Great disparities exist between organisms with regard to the relative ease of chromosomal mutagenesis and manipulation. In Chromosomal Mutagenesis, a team of experts provide a variety of chromosomal manipulation techniques, including insertional gene disruptions, gene knockouts, stimulated homologous recombination techniques and other novel tools, for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and attempt to expand the genetic toolbox beyond model organisms. Following the format of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology(TM) format, each chapter offers step-by-step laboratory instructions, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and cutting-edge, Chromosomal Mutagenesis covers state-of-the-art techniques that are staged to expand, if not revolutionize, genetic analysis in the long neglected and relevant cell types." -- (Back Cover)
