In her own image, women working in the arts
The work of western women artists, past and present, is collected here in a stunning array of forms: fiction, poetry, autobiography, essay, journal and letter writing, sculpture, painting, graphics, photography, ceramics, needlework, music, and dance. The unique experience of women artists from diverse national, ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds is explored from their own viewpoints, as are the important relationships between women's social condition and women's art.
