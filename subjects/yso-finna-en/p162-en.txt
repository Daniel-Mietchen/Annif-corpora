This book introduces using R for data mining. Data mining techniques are widely used in government agencies, banks, insurance, retail, telecom, medicine and research. Recently, there is an increasing tendency to do data mining with R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. According to a poll by KDnuggets.com in early 2011, R is the 2nd popular tool for data mining work. By introducing using R for data mining, this book will have a broad audience from both academia and industry. It targets researchers in the field of data mining, postgraduate students.
This authoritative book reveals the features of JavaScript that make it an outstanding object-oriented programming language, while warning about poor features.

Create and publish your own interactive data visualization projects on the Web-even if you have little or no experience with data visualization or web development. It’s easy and fun with this practical, hands-on introduction. Author Scott Murray teaches you the fundamental concepts and methods of D3, a JavaScript library that lets you express data visually in a web browser. Along the way, you’ll expand your web programming skills, using tools such as HTML and JavaScript. This step-by-step guide is ideal whether you’re a designer or visual artist with no programming experience, a reporter exploring the new frontier of data journalism, or anyone who wants to visualize and share data. -- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG basics -- Dynamically generate web page elements from your data - and choose visual encoding rules to style them -- Create bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, stacked bar charts, and force-directed layouts -- Use smooth, animated transitions to show changes in your data -- Introduce interactivity to help users explore data through different views -- Create customized geographic maps with data -- Explore hands-on with downloadable code and over 100 examples.

Abstract. Sending a bulk SMS with a mobile phone is often a task that is fraught with usability issues. It becomes evident that a mobile phone with its small form factor cannot deliver the level of user experience that a web application can.     This project aims to develop a web application where users can register, create and manage contacts and contact groups, send bulk SMS. Facebook will be integrated into the web application to enable users to sign up and login to the service. A Facebook page will also be created for the service where the web application can be used from there.     In developing the application, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript will be the tools used to accomplish this.     This project can further be extended in the future to allow 2-way SMS campaigns. It can also be used as a service to support critical operations like ambulance service, rescue and any operation that might need short automatic message distribution when an event occurs.
