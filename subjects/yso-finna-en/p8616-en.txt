A language in space : the story of Israeli sign language
"Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most linguistically, culturally, and geographically diverse regions of the world, home to more than 2,000 languages. As in the rest of the world, Deaf people live throughout the widely varying sub-Saharan communities, equally rich in their signed languages. An emergent body of scholarly research on sub-Saharan signed languages (SSSL) and related Deaf community organizing has created the opportunity to gather together the informed perspectives presented in this revolutionary collection. Drawing examples from all regions of sub-Saharan Africa--Western, Eastern, Central, and Southern--16 contributors join the volume editors in illuminating the circumstances pertaining to cross-border, cross-regional, and global engagements in sub-Saharan Deaf communities. This collection centers upon two interrelated purposes: to examine sub-Saharan African deaf people's perspectives on citizenship, politics, and difference in relation to SSSL practices, and to analyze SSSL practices in relation to sociopolitical histories and social change interests (including addressing aspects of culture, gender, language usage, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and ability). The editors have organized these themes under three main sections, Sub-Saharan Signed Languages and Deaf Communities, The Politics of Mobilizing Difference, and Citizenship. Such wide-ranging subjects as the ethics of studying Kenyan signed language, sign language and Deaf communities in Eritrea, and overcoming cultural and linguistic barriers to HIV/AIDS education drive home the importance of the unique and varied research in this collection"--

The first book to address the Deaf ethnicity debate by tracing the Deaf culture in American back over 300 years * Provides exhaustive pedigrees and lineages of Deaf American families What are ethnic groups? Are Deaf people who sign American Sign Language (ASL) an ethnic group? In The People of the Eye, Deaf studies, history, cultural anthropology, genetics, sociology, and disability studies are brought to bear as the authors compare the vales, customs and social organization of the Deaf World to those in ethnic groups. Arguing against the common representation of ASL signers as a disability group, the authors discuss the many challenges to Deaf ethnicity, in this first book-length examination of these issues. Stepping deeper into the debate around ethnicity status, The People of the Eye also describes in a compelling narrative the story of the founding families of the Deaf World in the US. Tracing ancestry back hundreds of years, the authors reveal that Deaf people's preference to marry other Deaf people led to the creation of Deaf clans, and thus to shared ancestry and the discovery that most ASL signers are born into the Deaf World, and many are kin. In a major contribution to the historical record of Deaf people in the US, The People of the Eye portrays how Deaf people-and hearing people, too-lived in early America. For those curious about their own ancestry in relation to the Deaf World, the figures and an associated website present pedigrees for over two hundred lineages that extend as many as three hundred years and are unique in genealogy research. The book contains an every-name index to the pedigrees, providing a rich resource for anyone who is interested in Deaf culture.

One hundred and sixth Annual report of the Clarke School for the deaf : Northampton, Massachusetts : for the year ending August 31, 1973.
This timely, important, and frequently dramatic story takes place in Spain, for the simple reason that Spain is where language was first systematically taught to the deaf. Early experiments involved a colorful cast of characters - a Benedictine monk, a secretive schoolteacher turned tutor to the aristocracy, an ambitious secretary to a noble household, a scholarly Jesuit in exile, an intellectual abbé inspired by the philosophy of the European Enlightenment, a liberal lawyer, and an adward-winning artist - who set aside other pursuits to teach deaf children. This instruction is thought to have begun in the mid-sixteenth century in Spanish monastic communities, where monks under vows of silence employed a well established system of signed communication. Early in the 1600s, deaf education entered the domain of private tutors, laymen with no use for the manual signs who advocated oral instruction for their pupils.As a result, deaf children where taught to speak and lip-read, and this form of deaf education, which has been the subject of controversy ever since, spread from Spain throughout the world. A Silent Minority focuses on what Susan Plann calls the preprofessional era of deaf education, up to and including the early decades of Madrid's Royal School for Deaf-mutes. She shows how changing conceptions of deafness and language influenced deaf education: By 1814, for example, deafness was characterized as an illness rather than a stigma. Although the education available to deaf people in Spain remained limited, nineteenth-century advances such as the inauguration of a curriculum based on sign language, the training of teachers for the deaf, and the expansion of public education in general brought new opportunities for deaf students. At the end of the preprofessional era, however, deaf people where disempowered because they where barred from the teaching profession.To this day the Spanish deaf community shows effects of the exclusion of deaf teachers for the deaf. The question raised by Plann's narrative extend well beyond the history of deaf education in Spain: they apply to other minority communities and deaf cultures around the world. At issue are the place of minority communities within the larger society and, ultimately, our tolerance for human diversity and cultural pluralism .
Orientation to deafness
Lauri is a dedicated young teacher for the deaf. Her past conceals a wound still unhealed, her present is a facade, and she uses her career to hide her loneliness. Drake, daytime TV's most popular star, has two hearaches - the daughter he believes will never have a normal life and the dead wife he can't forget. Jennifer is the beautiful hearing-impaired child who may become a pawn between the man and the woman she needs most. Now, in the heart of a New Mexico arts community, the three may become a family... but only if each one dares to find a voice and lets his or her fears and needs speak for themselves.
This first book in the series focuses in particular on article 29 of the Convention. Public and political participation are explored from various angles, allowing for a broader definition of the article, moving away from the narrow understanding that merely just takes into account the right to vote. The diverse chapters represent a range of disciplines and professionals; their backgrounds span from political stakeholders, to academic scholars, and NGO representatives. Further examination is also made as to how the rights enshrined in article 29 are applicable to deaf citizens, and how this has been ensured by State Parties and other political stakeholders.

Educational interpreting : how it can succeed
In Thompson's fine 12th mystery set in turn-of-the-20th-century New York City (after 2009's Murder on Waverly Place), Det. Sgt. Frank Malloy investigates the murder of Nehemiah Wooten, who was bludgeoned with a loving cup Wooten won for sculling at Harvard more than 30 years earlier. A follower of Alexander Graham Bell's views on eugenics, Wooten was opposed to two deaf people getting married on the grounds that such unions would produce only deaf offspring, an attitude that earned him an enemy within his own home. Wooten's attractive 16-year-old daughter, Electra, who could not hear, was hoping to marry a deaf teacher. When Malloy visits Wooten's pregnant widow and her water breaks, he calls in midwife Sarah Brandt. Thanks to her access to the victim's household, Sarah proves invaluable in helping him uncover the killer. While the psychology of the crime is less complicated than some might prefer, Thompson does a solid job bringing the past to life.

Interpreting services for the deaf and deaf-blind and deafened people in Finland
Since the number of deaf persons in the United States is small in comparison to the total population, many hearing persons during their lifetimes have little or no contact with a deaf person. It is to be expected, therefore, that they will have little knowledge of the problems imposed by deafness; and that what knowledge they might possess is likely to be erroneous in at least some respects. In view of this, any attempt to present research needs in the area of the deaf to a large number of professional individuals should provide some general background information to aid in understanding and interpreting those needs. In particular, it is desirable to provide information on the population under consideration, the deaf; on the special educational problems imposed by deafness; and on the sub-culture within which most deaf persons function socially.
The parents of a child diagnosed as deaf are immediately faced with a bewildering series of vital decisions. In this pioneering study, Paul Ogden, an educator who himself has been profoundly deaf since birth, and writer Suzanne Lipsett present the relevant issues clearly and objectively, from the natural initial responses of shock and resentment, through the processes of adjusting to daily life with a hearing-impaired child, to the fundamentally different approaches of oralism and total communication, special education or mainstreaming. The authors' impartial discussion of relative advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, illustrated by examples from the lives of people affected by deafness, allows parents and educators to make sensible decisions based on their own special situations. The Silent Garden will quickly establish itself as an important and authoritative resource for parents and teachers of deaf children.

A Maternal Reflective Method of teaching an Oral Mother Tongue to deaf children : psycholinguistics in the service of the deaf
Contemporary research has identified resilience  the ability to rebound and learn despite obstacles and adversities  as a key element to success in school. Black Deaf Students: A Model for Educational Success searches out ways to develop, reinforce, and alter the factors that encourage resilience in African American deaf and hard of hearing students. To find the individual characteristics and outside influences that foster educational achievement, author Carolyn E. Williamson conducted extensive interviews with nine African American deaf and hard of hearing adults who succeeded in high school and postsecondary programs. Until now, the majority of studies of African American deaf and hard of hearing students concentrated upon their underachievement. The only success stories available involved high-achieving African American hearing students. To create an effective model in Black Deaf Students, Williamson focuses on the factors that contributed to her subjects successes in postsecondary programs, what they viewed as obstacles and how they overcame them, and their recommendations for facilitating graduation from postsecondary programs. Her work gives voice to a group rarely heard in research, which enables readers to view them as a heterogeneous rather than homogeneous group. Their stories provide vital information for parents, school personnel, community stakeholders, and those enrolled in education and mental health preparation programs. In addition, the insights about how these adults succeeded can be useful in facilitating positive outcomes for students who are going into two-year colleges, vocational training, and work settings.
This book unveils a corner of human history which has hitherto been unexplored and is therefore unknown. It tells the story of why and how Francis Maginn, a deaf Irishman from Cork, inspired the formation of the oldest Association of Deaf Peole in the United Kingdom. The origin and development of the British Deaf Association can be understood only against the background of the fate of Deaf People in recent centuries. Their advance is a tale which should be of great interest and full of surprises to deag and hearing readers alike.

This second book in the series focuses in particular on article 27 of the Convention. Work and employment are explored from various angles, including the right to reasonable accommodation, as well as labour and trade union rights. The diverse chapters represent a range of disciplines and professionals; their backgrounds span from political and institutional stakeholders and representatives, to academic scholars, and NGO representatives. In particular, the authors explore how the rights enshrined in Article 27 are applicable to deaf and hard of hearing citizens, and how private companies and organisations are embodying diversity in the workplace.

Lend me your ear : rhetorical constructions of deafness
Child-abuse investigator Bo Bradley knows the rules: never get emotionally involved with the children you help. But it's not always easy- especially with the kind of personal problems Bo faces. Now, she's about to find it impossible. When the small boy known as Wwppo is found in a shack amid the lone pines and dusty canyons of Southern California, everyone assumes he is retarded. But Bo knows better, realising at once that he is deaf. As she digs deeper into the child×s past, she realises that this is more than a simple case of abandonment. Then an attempt is made on Weppo's life, pushing her into action. Risking personal involvement and professional ruin, Bo is determined to uncover the truth - and finds herself locked in a desperate struggle to save Weppo, and perhaps herself, from certain death.

"Increased interaction between sign language communities and the mainstream societies in which they function is creating the potential for greater equality of opportunity for people who are deaf and hard of hearing. In this volume, renowned scholars and policy makers from around the world present innovative and groundbreaking perspectives on the relationships among sign language, sustainable development, and equal opportunities. The contributors to this volume offer creative and open-minded explorations of the construct of sustainability that are informed by their work with deaf individuals, deaf communities, families of deaf children, and other stakeholders.

The second EBU Seminar on Deaf Programmes was held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, from 14th-19th October 1991. The Seminar was funded by Channel 4, the ITV Association and Tyne Tees Television, with additional financial support from the Independent Television Commission and BT. It was organised by Sheila Browne and Pam Armstrong of Tyne Tees Television with help from Bob Duncan (Tyne Tees) and Sue Crockford (Channel 4). Sixty-two delegates, approximately half of whom were deaf, attended the Seminar from sixteen countries. Twenty-three short papers were presented in plenary sessions; there were three workshop group sessions and six general plenary discussions. A video library was established, enabling delegates to view tapes in their free time. The papers reproduced in this report have been edited and abridged where necessary. Every effort has been made to retain all their essential points. Bayerischer Rundfunk has given an undertaking to organise the next EBU Seminar, in Munich, in 1993. Radio-Télévision Suisse Romande has expressed its willingness to be a candidate for the 1995 Seminar, in Geneva. The Organising Committee would like to thank all delegates, interpreters and other participants in the 1991 EBU Seminar on Deaf Programmes for their positive contributions to the success of the event.

The silent garden : understanding the hearing-impaired child
"Howard L. Terry wrote a novel between 1917 and 1919, which he donated to the Gallaudet University Archives in 1949. There it rested until a resurgence of interest in Deaf literature led to its recent rediscovery. Mickey's Harvest: A Novel of a Deaf Boy's Checkered Life recounts the rollicking tale of a young deaf boy and how he learned to survive and thrive at the advent of the 20th century. Mickey Dunmore's story begins with the sinking of his father's merchant sailing ship and ends with a cliffhanger in World War I. In school, after an illness caused his deafness, Mickey finds himself constantly fighting the hearing boys and later competing with the signing students when he attends a residential school for deaf students. In college, he and his best friend Dick Wagner leave early to travel the nation with the hobos, carnies, and grifters. In one town, they outfox a barker who was using a deaf girl to "read" the minds of their marks. Further on, they meet Bunny, the Mighty Mite deaf man who helps expose a hearing woman posing as deaf to scam sympathetic people. Mickey faces his greatest challenge when he falls in love with Marion Carrel, a deaf girl whose hearing father forbids their romance on eugenics grounds. Terry, who became deaf at the age of 11, states from the outset that he means for his novel to reveal the biases confronting deaf people at the time. As a tonic, he populates Mickey's Harvest with artistic, talented deaf individuals who engage readers in an earlier, colorful time as they "show their stuff."--

Dr Sylver and the repository of the past
This is the first comprehensive account of prolonged hearing loss and its impact on a language that was once spoken fluently. Although it is currently assumed that hearing loss results in speech deterioration, it is shown that language loss occurs when speakers remain deaf for a long time. The reader is introduced to a significant deaf population — postlingually deafened Yoruba speakers who have been deaf for more than twenty years and who have no access to hearing aids or speech therapy. After becoming deaf, they continue to speak Yoruba from memory and “hear” visually through lip reading. These speakers exhibit phonological, lexical and syntactic losses which mirror acquisition patterns attested in the speech of Yoruba children. Based on these similarities, it is argued that a direct link exists between language loss and first language acquisition. It is further argued that prolonged deafness results in language reversal. Finally, the book presents the first description of the sign language and gestures used by deafened speakers to augment their spoken language. These findings will be of value to linguists, speech, language and hearing therapists, anthropologists, Africanists, deaf studies researchers, and non-specialists who are interested in hearing health and wellness.

"Sicard was a French revolutionary priest who enjoyed a meteoric rise from Toulouse and Bordeaux to Paris. Despite the fact that he was a non-juror, he escaped the guillotine. In fact, the revolutionaries acknowledged him as one of the great creators of sign language. In the Terror of 1794, they made him the director of the first school for the deaf, and later he became a member of the first Ecole Normale of 1794, the National Institute, and the Acade;mie Française. He is recognized today as having developed Enlightenment theories of pantomime, "signing,' (and hopefully a "universal language") that later spread to Russia, Spain, and America. No book-length biography of Sicard has been published in any language since 1873, even though Sicard became an international "celebrity." My story is of interest to French and American language and deaf studies as well as to the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon"--
This book presents chapters by many eminent researchers and interventionists, all of whom address the development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children in the context of family and school. A variety of disciplines and perspectives are provided in order to capture the complexity of factors affecting development of these children in their diverse environments. Consistent with current theory and educational practice, the book focuses most strongly on the interaction of family and child strengths and needs and the role of educational and other interventionists in supporting family and child growth. This work, and the authors represented in it, have been influenced by the seminal work of Kathryn P. Meadow-Orlans, whose work continues to apply a multidisciplinary, developmental approach to understanding the development of deaf children. The book differs from other collections in the degree to which the chapters share ecological and developmental theoretical bases. A synthesis of information is provided in section introductions and in an afterword provided by Dr. Meadow-Orlans. The book reflects emerging research practice in the field by representing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. e chapters in the book may surprise readers in that they present a more positive view of family and child functioning than has historically been the case in this field. This is consistent with emerging data from deaf and hard of hearing children who have benefitted from early identification and intervention. In addition, it represents an emerging recognition of strengths shown by the children and by their deaf and hearing parents. The book moves from consideration of child and family to a focus on the role and effects of school environments on development. Issues of culture and expectations pervade the chapters in this section of the book, which includes chapters addressing effects of school placement options, positive effects of learning about deaf culture and history, effects of changing educational practice in developing nations, and the need for increased knowledge about ways to meet individual needs of the diverse group of deaf and hard of hearing students. Thus, the book gives the reader a coherent view of current knowledge and issues in research and intervention for deaf and hard of hearing children and their families.

National implementation and monitoring is analysed and good examples are presented from the different stakeholders involved in the process; from the view of the decision makers, to the independent monitoring organisations and civil society organisations (Disabled People’s Organisations, DPOs), both at European and national level. The diverse chapters represent a range of disciplines and professionals. Their backgrounds span from political and institutional stakeholders and representatives, to academic scholars and NGO representatives. In particular, the authors explore how the rights enshrined in Article 33 are applicable to deaf and hard of hearing citizens, and how they are involved in the process of assuring that the CRPD is implemented in the best way possible.

Louise Treadwell Tracy (1896-1983), the wife of film legend Spencer Tracy, takes center stage in this work. Providing background information on her life before her marriage in 1923, her own acting career in the theater, and the people who influenced her throughout her life, this work focuses on the profound effect the discovery that their son John, born in 1924, was deaf had on the Tracys. The years spent teaching him how to talk would inspire Louise to establish the John Tracy Clinic in 1942. Dedicated to bringing awareness to doctors, educators, parents and the public that preschool-age deaf children could learn to communicate orally, the clinic survived and flourished despite often devastating financial difficulties. As the years progressed, Mrs. Spencer Tracy emerged as a highly respected leader in the field of deaf education and a tireless ambassador for the hearing-challenged.

Founded 124 years ago, Gallaudet University×s mission is the education of deaf people. Gallaudet×s sixth president left the university in December 1987. In early March 1988 the board convened to select from among three finalists (two deaf men and a hearing woman) - the seventh president of Gallaudet. When the selection of the hearing candidate was announced, students, faculty, and staff at Gallaudet, who had been working peacefully for months in support of the appointment of a deaf president, were incensed. It was time to protest.
Subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing : the reception of Moulin Rouge! as a case study
This book examines sociolinguistic, educational and psycholinguistic factors that shape the path to sign bilingualism in deaf individuals and contributes to a better understanding of the specific characteristics of a type of bilingualism that is neither territorial nor commonly the result of parent-to-child transmission. The evolution of sign bilingualism at the individual level is discussed from a developmental linguistics perspective on the basis of a longitudinal investigation of deaf learners' bilingual acquisition of German sign language (DGS) and German. The case studies included in this volume offer unique insights into bilingual deaf learners’ sign language and written language productions, and the sophisticated nature of the bilingual competence they attain. Commonalities and differences between sign bilingual language development in deaf learners and language development in other language acquisition scenarios are identified on the basis of a dynamic model of change in the evolution of (learner) language, with a focus on the role of language contact in the organisation of multilingual knowledge and the scope of inter- and intra-individual variation in learner grammars. In many respects, as becomes apparent throughout the chapters of this work, sign bilingualism represents not only a challenge but also a resource. Given this cross-disciplinary perspective, the insights on bilingualism and deafness in this volume will be of interest to a wide range of researchers and professionals.
A Word in Deaf Ears : a Study of Communication and Behaviour in a Sample of 75 Deaf Adolescents
The thought processes of Deaf interpreters served as the research focus for this study. This longitudinal qualitative study was designed to assess the thought processes, using a three-phase research approach--a preliminary interview, Think Aloud Protocol, and a retro-debriefing interview to explore the strategies and recourses for effective interpretation. The Think Aloud Protocol was conducted with a given task in which the participants had to think aloud as they worked through the task. The preliminary interview gathered background information and experiences as interpreters and the retro-debriefing interview served a technique of collecting further thoughts after the Think Aloud Protocol activity and as a closure for the three-phase procedure. The entire study was videotaped and then translated from American Sign Language to English. A triangulation of the study explored the depths of the thought processes of six Deaf participants during the three-phase activity. Findings indicated results on best practices for strategies and resources for effective interpretation by Deaf interpreters.
Shouting won't help : why I--and 50 million other Americans--can't hear you
"Many students struggle with the transition from high school to the next stage of their lives. For deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students, that struggle can be intensified by barriers and discriminatory attitudes they face in their communities, schools, and workplaces. Though much progress has been made, they are often underemployed and underpaid, and they receive postsecondary training at lower rates than other disability groups. Author Pamela Luft explores the reasons for these statistics and offers strategies and resources that can improve outcomes. Promoting Positive Transition Outcomes is the most comprehensive discussion of transition planning and results for DHH students now available. Luft begins with an overview of the historical and current challenges to DHH students and their academic and vocational potential. She explores the importance of forming an identity and building foundational social and problem-solving skills. She then reviews the history of rehabilitation and workforce legislation, which now mandates that every student with an individualized education plan (IEP) have a transition plan in place by the age of 16. Most schools, however, are not equipped to meet the needs of a population as diverse as DHH students. She examines the services that are currently available in high schools and offers recommendations for strengthening transition team planning by reaching out to external experts. The volume concludes with suggestions for creating a framework to address the challenges of transition planning for deaf and hard of hearing students and offers guidance on building effective plans"--
Sociolinguistics in Deaf Communities
Input and interaction in deaf families
The energized structure of Lend Me Your Ear galvanizes new thought on the rhetoric surrounding Deaf people by posing basic questions from a rhetorical context: How is deafness constructed as a disability, pathology, or culture through the institutions of literacy education and science/technology, and how do these constructions fit with those of deaf people themselves? The rhetoric of deafness as pathology is associated with the conventional medical and scientific establishments, and literacy education fosters deafness as disability, both dependent upon the premise that speech drives communication. This kinetic study demands consideration of deafness in terms of the rhetoric of Deaf culture, American Sign Language (ASL), and the political activism of Deaf people. Brueggemann argues strenuously and successfully for a reevaluation of the speech model of rhetoric in light of the singular qualities of ASL poetry, a genre that adds the dimension of space and is not disembodied. Ironically, without a word being spoken or printed, ASL poetry returns to the fading, prized oral tradition of poets such as Homer. The speech imperative in traditional rhetoric also fails to present rhetorical forms for listening, or a rhetoric of silence. These and other break-out concepts introduced in Lend Me Your Ear that will stimulate scholars and students of rhetoric, language, and Deaf studies to return to this intriguing work again and again.

Introduction to aural rehabilitation
"Although it is commonly believed that deafness and disability limits a person in a variety of ways, Valuing Deaf Worlds in Urban India describes the two as a source of value in postcolonial India. Michele Friedner argues that the experiences of deaf people offer an important portrayal of contemporary self-making and sociality under new regimes of labor and economy in India. Friedner contends that deafness actually becomes a source of value for deaf Indians as they interact with nongovernmental organizations, with employers in the global information technology sector, and with the state. In contrast to previous political economic moments, deaf Indians increasingly depend less on the state for education and employment, and instead turn to novel and sometimes surprising spaces such as NGOs, multinational corporations, multilevel marketing businesses, and churches that attract deaf congregants. They also gravitate towards each other. Their social practices may be invisible to outsiders because neither the state nor their families have recognized Indian Sign Language as legitimate, but deaf Indians collectively learn sign language, which they use among themselves, and they also learn the importance of working within the structures of their communities to maximize their opportunities. Valuing Deaf Worlds in Urban India analyzes how diverse deaf people become oriented toward each other and disoriented from their families and other kinship networks. More broadly, this book explores how deafness, deaf sociality, and sign language relate to contemporary society. "--
The following pages represent the results of an effort which took over a decade to bring about. The original contact took place in 1965 and in the ensuing years flowered with the International Research Seminar on Vocational Rehabilitation of Deaf Persons and is just now bearing fruit. We have attempted, with the Congress, to bring into focus two major points. The first point is that the only limitations to a deaf person's achievement are those placed upon him by society - and what he himself accepts as his limitations. The second is that education, training, and the dissemination of information are essential to the removal of the barriers that have so far prevented deaf persons from realizing their potential and the goal of full citizenship to which we aspire. It is our hope that we have made the first step on the road to that aspiration; the first step being the hardest, further progress along that road will follow in due course. It is also incumbent upon me to note that the organization of any World Congress is a gigantic undertaking. The organization of this Congress was especially difficult because by its very nature it had to include a great mix of participants - a variety of professionals and a multitude of consumers. This mix compounded the communication problem and the mechanics of organization to the extent that the sponsors would have been swamped were it not for the support and assistance of many individuals.

Australian sign language (Auslan) : an introduction to sign language linguistics
The present book is a collection of papers based on presentations made at the International Workshop on Bilingualism and Literacy Concerning Deafness and Deaf-blindness, which took place at Skådalen Resource Centre for Special Education of the Hearing Impaired and the Deaf-blind, Oslo, on November 10-13, 1994. The workshop was organized as part of the preparatory phase of the research project The development of Communication and Linguistic Competence in Deaf and Deaf-blind Children. The contributors to the book have their backgrounds in education, psychology, linguistics, and sociology. Some are primarily researchers, others are primarily practitioners in the fields of deaf education and deaf-blind education. The book addresses itself primarily to everybody who takes an interest in the communicative and educational issues concerning deafness and/or deaf-blindness. Some of the papers take a more general perspective on these issues.

UNCRPD Implementation In Europe - A Deaf Perspective : Article 27: Work and Employment
"While many deaf organizations around the world have adopted an ethno-linguistic framing of deafness, the meanings and consequences of this perspective vary across cultural contexts, and relatively little scholarship exists that explores this framework from an anthropological perspective. In this book, Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway presents an accessible examination of deafness in Nepal. As a linguistic anthropologist, she describes the emergence of Nepali Sign Language and deaf sociality in the social and historical context of Nepal during the last decades before the Hindu Kingdom became a secular republic. She then shows how the adoption of an ethno-linguistic model interacted with the ritual pollution model, or the prior notion that deafness results from bad karma. Her focus is on the impact of these competing and co-existing understandings of deafness on three groups: signers who adopted deafness as an ethnic identity, homesigners whose ability to adopt that identity is hindered by their difficulties in acquiring Nepali Sign Language, and hearing Nepalis who interact with Deaf signers. Comparing these contexts demonstrates that both the ethno-linguistic model and the ritual pollution model, its seeming foil, draw on the same basic premise: that both persons and larger social formations are mutually constituted through interaction. Signing and Belonging in Nepal is an ethnography that studies a rich and unique Deaf culture while also contributing to larger discussions about social reproduction and social change."--

Megan's fourth-grade class is putting on their own original musical based on the book The Wizard of Oz, and Megan wants to be the star of the show and play Dorothy. Since she's deaf, she will sign the songs for her audition. However, a problem develops when Lizzie, her best friend from camp, transfers from her all-deaf school to Megan's class - and signs the same two songs that Megan was going to do! Luckily, Megan has some other ideas up her sleeve...
In 1811, deaf student Ferdinand Berthier commenced his education at the National Institute for the Deaf in Paris under its director Abbé Sicard and his teachers Auguste Bébian, Jean Massieu, and Laurent Clerc. Their tutelage eventually led Berthier to join the faculty at the Institute and become a life-long proponent of sign language and Deaf culture. Berthier earned fame for instituting the famous silent banquets in Paris in 1834. He also learned to advance his agenda by writing biographies of important figures who advocated sign over oralism to educate deaf French students. Forging Deaf Education in Nineteenth-Century France offers the first translation of Berthiers biographical sketches of the four men above who influenced him most. Berthier wrote first about Bébian in 1839, timed to advocate sign language for teaching deaf students after the death of the pro-oralism Institute Director Désiré Ordinaire. Berthier extolled Bébians linguistic acumen and his educational philosophy. In later sketches, however, he described Sicard and Massieu in positive terms, but also criticized them for supporting methodical signing that conformed to spoken language conventions. In contrast, he lauded Clerc in his portrayal for using natural signing to teach deaf students. The clarity of these translations will introduce a brand new audience to Berthiers biographies shaped by his unswerving beliefs about Deaf French education. Ferdinand Berthier (18031886) was President of the Société Centrale des Sourds-Muets, Dean of the Royal Deaf Institute of Paris, and a member of the Historical Institute of France.

The World Federation of the Deaf: A History is a large, colorful and beautifully designed book chronicling the world Deaf community and the national organizations of the Deaf around the globe. This far-reaching history highlights the achievements of Deaf people worldwide and also focuses on the advocacy efforts of member non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve human rights and the quality of life of Deaf citizens in their respective countries. This publication is an excellent educational and informational tool for use by national government officials, schools and individuals, that includes national organization background and current advocacy activities of the 127 affiliate member organizations of the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and more than 158 biographies of world leaders since the organization was established in Rome, Italy in 1951. The World Federation of the Deaf: A History includes summaries of 13 World Congresses of the World Federation of the Deaf.There are two special sections in the book, a four-color section depicting deaf national postal stamps from various countries around the world and a deaf international section that will briefly describe other international organizations of the deaf and their activities. Numerous photographs and other visuals are displayed throughout the book that enhance descriptions of the historical accomplishments and efforts of Deaf people who have worked together to improve the life of all Deaf people worldwide in nations throughout the world. "The Gannon's service and commitment to global Deaf community is immeasurable and priceless. This is a tremendous achievement. We couldn't thank them enough for their yeoman's work. We look forward to having this book change the world's perception of our community as an enlightened group of people who ask that our civil, human, and linguistic rights are respected," said NAD President Bobbie Beth Scoggins."We would like to thank everyone who was instrumental to bringing about the publication of this book, the WFD, Ordinary Members from all over the world, Gallaudet University, Gerald "Bummy" Burstein, the Laurent Clerc Cultural Fund (LCCF), and countless volunteers who pushed along this milestone." Writing this book has been a labor of love for author Jack R. Gannon. The idea was conceived in 1992 and became one of the most challenging and difficult projects ever undertaken by this experienced and well-known figure in the Deaf community. Gannon, a retired teacher and Gallaudet University administrator, is the author of two other books, Deaf Heritage, A Narrative History of Deaf America (also published by the NAD) and The Week the World Heard Gallaudet.^He is the curator of History Through Deaf Eyes, a national exhibition about the American Deaf community, which was developed at Gallaudet University and toured the United States and co-author of Through Deaf Eyes: A Photographic History of an American Community. My hope is that this book will become an important resource for Deaf people everywhere to better understand the remarkable efforts of our leaders who founded and sustained the WFD and our national organizations of the Deaf. At the same time this book can serve to enlighten those who are not deaf and share our struggle for human rights and the celebration of human difference, said Jack Gannon. The NAD and WFD believe that the Deaf community, their families and the professionals who work with them will learn more about the history of national Deaf associations worldwide and the importance of collaborative efforts among national and world organizations.This publication will also be an invaluable reference for students and other academics studying or researching the global Deaf community, and international policy and human rights issues.

A talented archivist, the author here outlines a long story of pride and resilience in the face of what many see as the double discrimination of being Deaf and female. By putting local history in the context of world events he firmly brings it out of the ghetto and, incidentally, provides a literary tonic to help to prevent Deaf women feeling sorry for themselves.
Early intervention for deaf and hard-of-hearing infants, toddlers and their families : interdisciplinary perspectives
"Told through a series of quirky, irreverent short stories and letters home during the early 1980s, The Deaf Heart chronicles a year in the life of Dempsey "Max" McCall, a Deaf biomedical photography resident at a teaching hospital on the island of Galveston, Texas. Max strives to become certified as a Registered Biological Photographer while straddling the deaf and hearing worlds. He befriends Reynaldo, an impoverished Deaf Mexican, and they go on a number of unusual escapades around the island. At the hospital, Max has to contend with hearing doctors, nurses, scientists, and teachers. While struggling through the rigors of his residency and running into bad luck in meeting women, Max discovers an ally in his hearing housemate Zag, a fellow resident who is also vying for certification. Toward the end of his residency, Max meets Maddy, a Deaf woman who helps bring balance to his life. Author Willy Conley's stories, some humorous, some poignant, reveal Max's struggles and triumphs as he attempts to succeed in the hearing world while at the same time navigating the multicultural and linguistic diversity within the Deaf world"--

Sign bilingualism : language development, interaction and maintenance in sign language contact situations
The concept of sociolinguistics in Deaf communities means a powerful explosion: all over the world, as self-awareness and self-empowerment grow in Deaf communities, issues in all areas of sociolinguistics are emerging. The occurrence and distribution of sign languages throughout the world, their interaction with spoken languages, and the accompanying language choices users make; language policy and planning in education, in interpreting, and in the media; the teaching of sign languages as second languages; linguistic and sociolinguistic variation within sign languages; the structure of sign language discourse; language attitudes in Deaf communities - these are some of the sociolinguistic issues that are demanding attention. In this first volume, the selection of papers shows the variety and range of sociolinguistics issues currently facing Deaf communities: the nature of sociolinguistic variation within ASL, fingerspelling in LSQ, the acquisition of fingerspelling in ASL, language use by a Navajo family with deaf children, language policy, classroom practice and multiculturalism in deaf education, aspects of ASL discourse and of the discourse of sign language used by Deaf Filipinos, and the nature and role of rhetorical language in Deaf social movements. This volume will help us gain a clear understanding of the richness and complexity of sociolinguistics in Deaf communities.

Throughout the last two centuries a controversial question has plagued the field of education of the deaf - Should sign language be used to communicat ewith and instruct deaf children? Never The Twain Shall Meet focuses on the debate over this question, especially as it was waged in the 19th century, when it was at is highest pitch and the battlelines were clearly drawn. During the 19th century the controversy pitted advocates of the oral method against advocates of the combined method. Alexander Graham Bell was the outspoken leader of the oralists. Bell and the oralists felt that deaf people had to adjust to living in a hearing world. For this reason, the oralists strongly endorsed the use of speech and speechreading as the only effective methods for instruction and communication. Deaf children in oral classes were not permitted to use sign language. Bell's rival in the communications debate was Edward Miner Galludet. Gallaudet believed that only through sign language could deaf children realize their full intellectual potential. While Gallaudet endorsed the use of sign language in the classroom and in the deaf community, he also believed that deaf childdren should be tahught to speak and speecchread. Bell and Gallaudet came from similar backgrounds - both had deaf mothers, both had influentual fathers, and both were teachers of the deaf - yet their approaches to eduating deaf children were entirely different.

The needs of the deaf and deaf-blind people who use sign language and pressure from their own organizations have been the stimulus for getting interpreting services going on society's cost. The interpreting services for deaf and deaf-blind people is based on the Services and Assistance for the Disabled Act, 1988. In the beginning , interpreting services meant interpreting in sign language for the deaf and deaf-blind people; for the deaf-blind people also other means of interpreting were allowed. Nowadays the interpreting services have been enlarged to aid also deafened people who don't know sign language, but who can use for instance written communications in the interpreting situation. The persons with speech difficulties can use interpreting services according to their individual needs.
Madness in the mainstream
"Deaf People and Society incorporates multiple perspectives related to the topics of psychology, education, and sociology, including the viewpoints of deaf adults themselves. In doing so, it considers the implications of what it means to be deaf or hard of hearing and how deaf adults’ lives are impacted by decisions that professionals make, whether in the clinic, the school, or when working with family. This second edition has been thoroughly revised and offers current perspectives on the following topics: •Etiologies of deafness and the identification process •The role of auditory access •Cognition, language, communication, and literacy •Bilingual, bilingual/bimodal, and monolingual approaches to language learning •Educational, legal, and placement aspects •Childhood psychological issues •Psychological and sociological viewpoints of deaf adults •The criminal justice system and deaf people •Psychodynamics of interaction between deaf and hearing people. Each chapter begins with a set of objectives and concludes with suggested readings for further research. This edition contains 10 new and original case studies, including ones on hearing children of deaf adults, sudden hearing loss, a young deaf adult with mental illness, and more. Written by a seasoned deaf/hearing bilingual team, this unique text continues to be the go-to resource for students and future professionals interested in working with deaf and hard-of-hearing persons."--
