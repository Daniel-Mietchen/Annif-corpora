Abstract: Postoperative pain assessment in pediatric patients : a literature review. The aim of this literature review was to explore the methods and tools used in postoperative pediatric pain assessment. The  purpose of this literature review was to conduct a comprehensive description of pain assessment in pediatric patients in  surgical settings.  The literature review is based on 22 scientific research articles. The data was systematically collected using OVID/CINAHL  and Science Direct. Additionally, manual search through library journal collections and e-journals was conducted in order to  find relevant research literature. A critical appraisal was conducted in order to ensure the suitability of the studies to this  literature review, and to ensure their quality. Literature was analysed and collected using inductive content analysis.  The findings of this literature review showed that postoperative pain in pediatric patients can be assessed by nurses through  patients' self-report, use of behavioural/observational scales and physiological indicators. In addition to these methods used  by nurses, there are tools and methods of pain assessment that are developed for parents. The main factors influencing pain  assessment in this specific patient population were found to be the medical diagnosis, child characteristics and nurse  characteristics.  One of the most important findings of this literature review was that no single pain assessment method or tool should be  used alone; rather, a comprehensive and multifaceted approach in pain assessment is emphasized. Another finding was that  parents may have a negative influence on the pain assessment of their children due to their poor knowledge and  misconceptions. Lastly, the knowledge deficits and unprofessional attitudes toward a child's pain should be confronted  among nurses.  Not all of the pain assessment tools used in pediatric postoperative settings have strong empirical evidence to support their  use. Further research on these tools in needed.  Keywords  Pain.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical implications of a combination of a peripheral opioid, paracetamol (APAP) and ketoprofen (KTP) on the intensity of acute postoperative pain by focusing on tonsillectomy (TE) and third molar extraction. A second focus in the study was to assess the utility of the surgical ultrasonically activated scalpel (HS) technique for TE.In Study I, TE was performed on one side using the HS and on the contralateral side using a "blunt dissection technique". The first TE study (I) demonstrated that - based on NRS pain scores during the first 10 postoperative hours - intra-operative blood loss and need for haemostasis were greater on the blunt dissection side than on the HS side. Pain scores were higher on the HS side than on the cold dissection side during the second postoperative week.Study III assessed the analgesic effect of a peripheral dose of 4 mg morphine. The peritonsillar infiltration of morphine locally did not significantly decrease pain compared to the control side.Studies (II and IV) included patients who were scheduled for third molar extraction. In Study II, patients received 1000 mg APAP or 100 mg KTP or both or a placebo to evaluate pain relief after third molar extraction. This study demonstrated that the mean sum of pain intensity differences scores up to the 1.5 h mark and the mean time to onset of pain relief at rest and on swallowing were favoured in the combination group more than in the APAP, KTP, and placebo groups.In Study IV, patients were assigned for a submucosal injection of 2 mg morphine or NaCl into either the non-inflamed (Trial I) or the inflamed (Trial II) peridental tissue, while the active control group received the same drugs in reverse order intramuscular (IM). Postoperative pain intensity at rest and on swallowing was assessed in all studies using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Painscores in the peripheral morphine group at rest (Trials I and II) and on swallowing (Trial I) were not associated with any further pain reduction. Pain scores on swallowing during the 2â€“6 hours postoperative period (Trial II) were greater in the IM morphine group.HS TE was associated with decreased pain in the early postoperative period, but there was increased pain and otalgia during the second postoperative week. Locally administered peripheral morphine was not associated with any benefit during the postoperative period after TE.The multimodal analgesia combination of a single dose of KTP and APAP demonstrated the same benefit during the early postoperative period without an increase in side effects. Locally administered peripheral morphine produced significant analgesia on swallowing during the early postoperative stage in inflamed tissue after third molar extraction.
