This study demonstrates the factors which influence consumer behaviour in general, and the role that the brand plays in the consumer buying process. The target of this thesis is the Chinese mobile phone market. The objective is to outline the current Chinese consumer behaviour when the Shanzhai mobile phone is launched. In addition, it focuses on what Chinese consumers think about Shanzhai. Also the dynamics of Shanzhai brought on the market are discussed. The theoretical approach for the study is based on concepts of consumer behavior, the consumer buying process and the brand image facet. In order to collect empirical data, a quantitative research technique was used. An online survey was carried out and sent out by Internet. The questionnaire was designed in accordance with the theoretical framework. Secondary data was gathered for analyzing social and cultural influences, the Shanzhai phenomenon. Primary data was used to illustrate current Chinese consumer behaviour when it comes to purchasing mobile phones. A total of 152 responses were obtained. The result shows that Chinese consumer behaviour is strongly influenced by its social and cultural environment; different gender causes different behaviour; the outer appearance of the mobile phone seems to be the chief factor which affects consumers' buying decision. The brand is highly appreciated in urban areas, but not much rurally. The Shanzhai incompletely equals fake; consumers still remain the old image of Shanzhai which is the imitation, low quality and so forth; development of Shanzhai is in the transitional period and application of 3G brings more resistances to Shanzhai industry.
