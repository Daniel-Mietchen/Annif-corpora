We introduce a model of price competition with endogenous market transparency, where it is costly for consumers to get informed about the announced prices. We show that there is symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium with a monotonic relationship between the degree of transparency and intensity of competition. Interestingly, we find that there exist multiple equilibria with zero, low and high levels of market transparency with the high level of market transparency being the stable equilibrium. Once comparing the stable equilibrium with the welfare maximizing one we find that the private market solution entails excessive investments in information acquisition. That is, at high levels of transparency the gain of consumers from increased transparency is smaller than the loss in the firms' profits leading to decrease in total welfare.

The main objective of the study is to provide insight on how digital signage can create benefit and what can be done with the content to ensure its efficiency. Digital signage is a relatively new form of digital communication. Digital signage networks consists of displays, a content storage devices (media player), and some mechanism to manage and upload the content that appears on displays. The study is assigned by a Finnish digital signage solution developer and provider company First Technology Ltd. The company strives to alleviate the uncertainty of potential customers that are yet uncertain of the benefits of deploying a digital signage system by providing solid, fact-based answers, and by creating guidelines for efficient use of the network. Digital signage ROI is studied and measured by defining the profits of selling advertising space with a desk study. The effect of digital content to buying behavior is researched by an action research promotion study conducted in April 2012 with TOK Wine & Deli coffee shop and Sokos Wiklund displays. Some international studies have been made of digital signage effect on sales (such as Walmart SMART or Neo's Copp Pronto TV results), which will be taken into consideration to answer the questions of how to create better ROI for a digital signage system. The criteria behind effective digital signage content is studied with a content analysis executed with a web-based 3M Visual Attention Service software to analyze the effect of still images that are used on digital displays within selected FirstView customers. There are no similar studies made of usage and benefits of digital signage within the Finnish markets and within Finnish companies. The lack of studies is a disadvantage itself, but it also effects on the companies willingness to deploy and engage digital signage solutions as a part of their communication strategies. The study is limited to converse only on content production, digital signage ROI, and the effect of digital signage to buying behavior. The study does not take a stance on the actual hardware used, the amount, size, or type of the displays, or how and where the system is physically installed or who manages the content, which form of content is used, or which products are promoted on screens. As more institutions and companies come to realize the potential of digital signage network, their use will proliferate resulting that good and even great quality content will evidently get better. This study amongst others within the industry and topic of DS profitability and content efficiency verify the advantages of investing in a digital signage network and using its full capabilities in order to gain profits.
Open government : [collaboration, transparency, and participation in practice]
"Transparency is a powerful attribute in design, carrying a personality that can be as glaring as hues. It extends and limits vision, spawns a sense of presence and absence and conceals and reveals content, luring viewers into exploring what lies beneath and beyond. Whether it is a tangible element or a conceptual idea that deceives the eyes, it is this beguiling layer that can make all the difference. As the latest addition to the well-loved colour-themed collection PALETTE, PALETTE No.6: Transparent kicks off the new cycle of design practice where visibility is called into question. In three sections sorted by opacity, transparency and then everything in between, this book unveils the mutable visual experiences of transparency and how they can be achieved through the inventive use of materials, paper and printing. Encompassing brand identities, product packaging, photography as well as installations, the 110 select works demonstrate how transparency is interpreted anew in design"--Publisher's description.

This book introduces the optical multi-band polarization imaging theory and the utilization of the multi-band polarimetric information for detecting the camouflage object and the optical hidden marker, and enhancing the visibility in bad weather and water. The book describes systematically and in detail the basic optical polarimetry theory; provides abundant multi-band polarimetric imaging experiment data; and indicates practical evaluation methods for designing the multi-band polarization imager, for analyzing and modeling the object's multi-band polarization characteristics, and for enhancing the vision performance in scattering media. This book shows the latest research results of multi-band polarimetric vision, especially in camouflage object detection, optical hidden marker detection and multi-band polarimetric imagery fusion.

The hospitality industry has greatly benefited from the evolution of the Web into an effective marketing tool. The business implications of internet presence in the hospitality industry have never been as evident as it is now. Regarded as simply another marketing channel for large chains, a well constructed Website can help level out competition, enabling small to medium sized enterprise hotels to attract a wider spectrum of visitors.  The Website design for a SME hospitality establishment is increasingly important as consumers have gradually begun to apply quality perceptions to the company in correspondence with the overall image of its website. For an SME establishment to fully benefit from having a website, management will need to understand the requirements of potential visitors and the optimal design characteristics to create the appropriate perceptions.  The thesis introduces the basics of usability in website design and the existing usability of SME hospitality Websites. It analyses Websites and examines the theory of hidden and visible website design and usability, which comprise an overall image. It compares the above factors to the Website design competence of hospitality managers and their success in properly achieving a meaningful and beneficial internet presence.  The findings support the hypothesis established prior to the research; the reason for the gap between hospitality managers' competence and actual perceived qualities of SME hospitality websites is lack of understanding of the possibilities and basics of website design and usability.
