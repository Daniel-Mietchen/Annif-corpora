"Preface Waste: A Handbook of Waste Management is designed to be a resource for the designer, practitioner, researcher, teacher and student. Waste is one of those entities which is defined by everyone, but not truly and completely understood by anyone. The scientist, engineer and consumer each define waste correctly, yet differently. The overriding challenge for the authors was to provide some uniformity, yet allow for the diversity of the various aspects of waste in this handbook. After all, a handbook is often the beginning of the search for information, certainly not the end. We have borrowed from all scientific disciplines, and a few humanities, to arrive at a balanced resource. And, indeed, balance is the key to environmental science and engineering"--Provided by publisher.

Preventing waste at the source
Textile exerts various environmental impacts throughout its life cycle. Prevention of textile waste is one means to reduce these impacts. This study seeks to map-out the flow of textile products in the three Nordic Countries - Denmark, Finland and Sweden - from the time they are put on the market until they are discarded. Based on the findings on the flows as well as on the perception of stakeholders, the study reviews and discusses government interventions that may be useful for the enhancement of textile waste prevention. Potential use of various policy instruments based on the concept of extended producer responsibility (EPR) is analysed. The study indicates a handful of areas where further research is needed in order to fine-tune policy actions that would best address the situation specific to the case countries.

A rapidly changing and expanding livestock and poultry production sector is causing a range of environmental problems on local, regional and global scales. Animal Manure Recycling: Treatment and Management presents an accessible overview of environmentally friendly technologies for managing animal manure more efficiently and in a sustainable manner. This book describes the physical and chemical characteristics of animal manure and microbial processes,featuring detailed examples and case studies showing how this knowledge can be used in practice.
