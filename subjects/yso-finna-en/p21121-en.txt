Nō and Bunraku : two forms of Japanese theatre
The world of puppets
The lovers' exile
The story, one Chikamatsu's domestic tragedies, recounts the love between a penniless clerk and an indentured prostitute. In Bunraku, as the reciter tells the story, the master holds the puppet against his chest, and his right arm gives life to the right arm of the puppet. His two assistants are clothed in black; one assistant gives life to the left arm of the puppet, the other gives life to the body, skirts, or legs.
