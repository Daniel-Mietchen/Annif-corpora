This book explores the problem of time and immanence for phenomenology in the work of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jacques Derrida. It provides an in-depth analysis of phenomenologys central notions of intentionality, immanence, and temporality, suggesting a new perspective on themes central to phenomenology and its development as a movement. The author raises for debate the question of where phenomenology begins and ends. Detailed readings of immanence in light of the more familiar problems of time-consciousness and temporality provide the framework for evaluating both Husserl's efforts to break free of modern philosophy's notions of immanence, and the influence Hiedegger's criticism of Husserl exercised over Merleau-Ponty's and Derrida's alternatives to Husserl's phenomenology.
