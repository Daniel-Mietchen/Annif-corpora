"Shocking moments in society create an extraordinary political environment that permits political and opinion changes that are unlikely during times of normal politics. Strong emotions felt by the public during catastrophes, even if experienced only vicariously through media coverage are a powerful motivator of public opinion and activism. This is particularly true when emotional reactions coincide with attributing blame to governmental agencies or officials. By examining public opinion during one extraordinary event, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lonna Rae Atkeson and Cherie D. Maestas show how media information interacts with emotion in shaping a wide range of political opinions about government and political leaders. Catastrophic events bring citizens together, provide common experiences and information, and create opinions that transcend traditional political boundaries. These moments encourage citizens to reexamine their understanding of government, its leaders, and its role in a society from a less partisan perspective"--
An important part of every manager's job is changing people's behavior: to improve someone's performance, get them to better manage relationships with colleagues, or to stop them doing something. Yet, despite the fact that changing people's behavior is such an important skill for managers, too many are unsure how to actually go about it. This book reveals the simple, but powerful techniques for changing behavior that experts from a range of disciplines have been using for years, making them available to all managers in a single and comprehensive toolkit for change that managers can use to drive and improve the performance of their staff. Based on research conducted for this book, it introduces practical techniques drawn from the fields of psychology, psychotherapy, and behavioral economics, and show how they can be applied to address some of the most common, every-day challenges that managers face. #changingpeople.

Questions were divided into three main classes: Employee motivation and involment, competences and compensations, teamwork and communications. In the analysis part these three main categories were divided into smaller entities. These entities are analyzed one by one using the answers of the survey. In this reseach we brought out things related to work satisfaction and change management. Additionally we tried to find out the current state of teams Request Management and User Account Management.

We are on the cusp of a revolution. Mobile phones, computers and iPods are commonplace in hundreds of millions of households worldwide, influencing how we think and shaping how we interact. With the gathering of information now largely automated, it leaves room for deeper conceptual thinking. The trouble is, says futurist Richard Watson, such deep thinking cannot take place if we never really sit still or completely switch off from the connected world. In this absorbing new book, Watson argues that despite the advances of the digital age, it has also robbed us of some of our best ideas; to reg.

This purpose of this thesis was to make the reader familiar with the requirements of a disaster recovery plan. The objective was to give readers a basic knowledge of making a disaster recovery plan for their own company or organization. The thesis describes on a general level which facts should be included in the recovery plan, how the whole recovery plan process flow in general proceeds, and how the recovery plan should be analyzed. The target group of the thesis was a validation laboratory of an electronics industry, whose point of view had to be taken into account in the requirements of the disaster recovery plan. The special features of the validation laboratory of the electronics company were also taken into account. The companies should have a valid disaster recovery plan. Especially the companies should take care of their organizations or departments that find it difficult to recovery from disasters.The validation laboratories of electronics companies are included in a high-risk group, because the laboratories use measuring equipment that requires a lot of resources to reorder new equipment, and new measuring equipment has long delivery times. It is common that the delivery times are at least six months or even longer. It is also difficult to find and rebuild new premises for a validation laboratory and it will require a lot of resources and capital from the company. In the thesis process flows for the creation of the disaster recovery plan for the validation laboratory of the electronics industry were developed The whole disaster recovery plan process, step by step, was explained using the process flows, and the special features of the validation laboratory were taken into account. In addition, tables and methods that support designing the disaster recovery plan for the validation laboratory were developed in the thesis.The descriptions of process flows can also be used when designing a disaster recovery plan for other organizations or companies. Before re-using the process flows in another organization, all special features of the plan to be taken care of should be considered. The process flows should be updated to suit to the new organization or company.

Wallac Oy, part of Perkin Elmer company, is a developer and manufacturer of in vitro diagnostic products. The main market area for these products is the United States of America (USA). The marketing of these products is regulated by the legislation and the responsible regulatory authority is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The purpose of this Master's Thesis project was to develop an impact analysis process for change management concerning the products and processes under the regulations of the FDA with a special emphasis on products requiring a Premarket Approval (PMA). These products are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The first step in the process was to become familiar with the regulations and guidelines related to the change management. The next step was to transfer the knowledge into practice.As it was noticed in the gap analysis between the current company practices and the regulations, the change management process itself has been sufficiently defined. However, the regulatory requirements in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) were only briefly discussed. Therefore a new process with more detailed instructions was needed. As the impact analysis of the changes is usually complicated, it was noticed that there was a need for a review board whose main task would be to assess the effects of the changes. The board was formed and it contained members from several departments. The main issues that need to be evaluated when assessing the effects of the changes were the effects on the safety and effectiveness of the product. Another important issue is the effects on the indication for use. The types of changes were categorized into four different types. These were labeling changes, design or performance changes, manufacturing changes and material changes.Based on this information five different flowcharts were developed with simple yes/ no answers. The output of the project with flowcharts will be implemented into practice by Wallac Oy and it is also their responsibility to update the flowcharts as new information arises.
