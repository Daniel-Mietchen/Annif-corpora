Astrobothnia
"Abelardo Morell makes photographs that transform everyday things into magical, ominous and mysterious objects. His spell-binding pictures of books, maps, paintings and household items explore reality and illusion through the use of surprising perspectives, unexpected angles, distorted sizes and distances. In Morell's hands a stack of library books are transformed into bars of gold and a plain paper bag becomes a portal to another dimension. This is the only book that covers the photographer's complete career to the present day and included here are his extraordinary camera obscura images, his tender family photographs and more recently the photographer's enchanting illustrations of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
