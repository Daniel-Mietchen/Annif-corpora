This bachelor thesis is about Website development and design. I have a chance to work with Mc kalla Oy. Mc kalla Oy is a construction company from Kempele which was founded 2011. They have projects in Central-Finland, through Northern Finland to Lapland. This thesis is to develop and design a new website to Mc kalla Oy. Wordpress is used to develop the new website. For the development process I use school server (.opiskelijaprojektit.net). The Thesis contains two main parts designing the website layout and implementing the design. With meeting with the commissioner, I had a good understanding of their expectation. They are expecting, a website easy to maintenance and update. The new website is easy to navigate and has enough information. The new website contains photo galleries, videos, PDF files and music. The new website is connected with companies Facebook page. As the result of this thesis,www.mckalla.fi is available for Mc Kalla Oy customers. The website is accessible for any device which has internet connection. The website manages to fulfill all the Mc kalla Oy’s expectations. From my discussion with the commissioner, the commissioner is satisfied with the result.
This thesis aims to create a guide for making a successful website. And will go with the scope showing why some web sites does not work, why they don?t show the same content on a plenty of different browsers and operating systems, as a matter of fact will be going through the HTML and CSS codes to see how they interact together and what cause the most major problems. And why not for other web-site acquisition and design. The guide is intended to guide the driving and compelling website design. My thesis will go through the websites as a main task, problems, and website influence on marketing. Empirical part and concentrate on the design process of making a site is the most important and central step. Following the instructions to get a new home page, look better, and marketing on the Internet is going better. The design model is created in such a way that the marketing or the entrepreneur himself would be able to design an effective and user-friendly web site, even if the programming does not know any. The finished plan is a programmer's quick and easy to implement and the outcome of appeals to both entrepreneurs and users. Solutions will be tested and gives a clear idea about the problem and how it was fixed. So, basically I will treat compatibilities, HTML standards and web sites design since after a wide research realized that the HTML code should be clean and goes with the standards and more than that the design is very important.

Abstract: The Fryske Akademy hosts the Mercator Research Centre, the Network of Schools, and the Mercator Network websites. They were originally developed on Plone® 'content management system' (CMS) platform which had been decided to be replaced by TYPO3® CMS. Additionally, the accessibility features were inadequate.    Little knowledge was available regarding the methodology of converting a Plone-based website to TYPO3 platform. Building up knowledge on this matter as well as clearly documenting the migration were the essential goals of this assignment.    All three Mercator websites were successfully migrated during the project. Achieving this positive outcome resulted from a comprehensive analysis of the initial circumstances, and from a determination to design a verified migration method.    The templates of all three websites were recreated by committing to W3C's Markup Validation, and accessibility was improved by following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Additionally, the flexible template design allowed straight-forward implementation of “neat features” in the end. The Fryske Akademy went live on the new platform as of finishing the writing of this document.    This study teaches that while the actual content migration is merely a mechanical task, recreating existing website's template design under another CMS architecture and/or ideology can be challenging. Nonetheless, redesigning and upgrading an outdated CMS software is an opportunity for an organization to refresh their web presence, and furthermore, renew web editors' toolbox for content management..

Abstract: This project was made for a company that provides a networking website for people who are interested in music. The objective of this project was to develop an application which collects and stores data from two distinct websites namely, http://www.muusikoiden.net and http://www.imperiumi.net. Both websites contain rich information about artists and their gig schedule, which was the main interest of the company. Another goal was to compile one data table that contains all the information which was gathered from the above mentioned sites. The application was developed using a web crawler integrated with Document Object Model Interface, which enables different programming languages to access any websites by representing the components in a more structured form. This crawler was made to iterate for every page in the websites. After parsing, the stored data was analyzed by the application to detect if there were any name prefixes, and remove those prefixes on every occurrence. Finally, a complete table with all the required information was build. Web crawler is a powerful programming application which can help for locating and accessing information from any web documents. And by combining the information it is possible to innovate or make useful analysis.

Abstract: The purpose of this project was to design a website MyInstrumentalMusic.com that focuses on up and coming, signed, unsigned, independent and currently popular music producers to sell their instrumental music online. The site promotes the instrumentals uploaded by the music producers exposing their talent for the artist who wants to make use of it. This social media format supports and encourages the interaction between producers and artists online. Producers show off their music by uploading their instrumentals to the market and make money out of it. The site is looking forward to shorten and improve the long-distance relationship that is holding music producers and artists to work together. MyInstrumentalMusic.com believes that exposed talent can be harvested easily with less pain bringing success in a short period of time. The website is designed from scratch using the Zend Framework. The entire project was developed and tested on my home computer using the XAMPP server which is an open source cross-platform web server capable of serving dynamic web pages.  www.MyInstrumentalMusic.com.

This thesis goes through the process of creating a graphic design of a web page which includes determining all the components and how they can affect the visual outcome. The main task is to create a design plan for a website by creating images with an image editing software with the support of theoretical knowledge, end users’ preferences, and creativity. The aim is to create a modern design considering the responsive functions and the users’ needs. The users’ perspectives, needs, and habits are explored by interviewing companies supplied by the commissioner. The theoretical research contributes technical guidance on making choices in the design of a web page. The designs were made with Adobe Photoshop, which was accessible at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences, as was the recorder used in the interviews. The images in the designs were chosen from the commissioner’s existing website. The colours used in the designs were designated with the help of a colour wheel application. This thesis may be used by the commissioner for their webpage as well as anyone who is working with visual designs and looking for some theoretical explanations. The information covers many aspects of design as a webpage is a whole consisting of many components, such as text, layouts, and various types of graphics.

A Guide on How to Create a Credible Tourism Website
In the last decade none of the fashion brand companies were connected to their customers via blogs or social networks. Nowadays the situation significantly changed. Brands such as Hugo Boss use apart of their website social media networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and write blogs in order to be closely connected to their target groups. Hugo Boss, but also companies like Scotch and Soda use the “Instagram” photo application to show their customers insides of the brand with e.g. backstage pictures of catwalk shows. By using the latest web design trends and features they keep in mind to show a consistent brand image. Also blogs are integrated to the main website to fulfill a consistent look.     Purpose of this bachelor thesis is to create a professional website. The client, who works in the fashion industry, defined her requirements. Creating a superior web design following the latest web design trends and the availability of a blog are the major ones. The website is about the client's visions of fashion with the aim to connect with existing customers but also to extend her actual market area. In order to accomplish the project successfully theory needed to be considered before creating the website. Therefore the design, development, launch and deployment of the web page about fashion is based on theory which includes web design principles, audience and their behavior, brand image, page design and layout, search engine optimization and web design trends. After describing the practical part, the report ends with a summary, conclusions and recommendations.

The purpose of this thesis was to demonstrate technologies designing websites with a special focus on usability issues.     The research was carried out as both quantitative and qualitative methods. The report was divided into two parts. In the first part, technologies for creating websites were introduced accompanied with practical examples.     The second part of the thesis provided comprehensive guidlines about the usability concerns of website design. The website of Haaga-Helia UAS (HH)was used to check and test the usability best practices. Field observation and interviews were used to collect user feedback.     The study gave constructive knowledge about the site to the user and effective feedback to the IT department of Haaga-Helia UAS. The study indicated that, in most cases, HH website complies with the best practises of web usability, yet, there are still some usability issues regarding e.g. the search engine, site structure, ads and shortcuts. According to the study, these concepts need to be modified in order to acquire better user satisfaction.     This study is a good overview for the beginners who want to become web designers. Furthermore, it offers a compact package of information about various usability theories for those already designing websites.

The purpose of this thesis is to examine a corporate web site's role in strengthening the company's image as a potential employer. The goal is to find out how university students perceive the client company's web site and how this web site could be developed to help it correspond better to students' career aspirations. The client company's success in the market is closely linked to their human capital, which highlights the importance of attracting talented university graduates. The framework of the thesis consists of the different elements that affect an employer's image. It examines how the general corporate image affects a specific employer's image. After this, it looks at how recruitment communication and a corporate web site can be used to increase an organization's attractiveness to potential employees. As part of my thesis I conducted a Webropol survey for the third-year students of Aalto University School of Economics. The survey was conducted in May 2012. The first part of the survey examined the same factors than the employer image surveys conducted in 2011 and 2010 by Universum. However, the main focus in this case was on the client company's web site and how it reflects the desired employer image. The survey reveals that these students value the same things that they traditionally have valued, i.e. possibilities for training and development and a pleasant work environment. These students also consider a corporate web site as their preferred source of information, as was previously the case. However, the aspects that students consider the most important are not visible enough on the client company's web site. The company should focus on simplifying their employment content information and navigation so that students could find the relevant information more easily. One developmental suggestion was also to increase the transparency between the company and students.

The aim of this thesis was to improve the quality of the website, to increase the efficiency, productivity, user friendliness as well as minimize the number of errors encountered by the users while navigating the site. Making the website easier to use benefits the company to know which parts customers would select the most. The owner of the company would be able to redesign their website, add new features to target certain customers, edit an unclear or confusing feature and get information on a lacking content or features from the users. The test was done according to the Thinking Aloud test method and to collect and analyze the results, five different individuals having some technical knowledge were participated in the usability test. The participants were tested in a different time schedule in a well managed testing room. All the tasks done by the participants were recorded by the Morae Software during the test and this software was totally invisible to the test participants. It helped to find out the most lacking areas and whether the test users have the same type of usability problems on the website or not. After the usability test was completed, the results were analysed and compiled into a report, which contains actionable recommendations for fixing the observed issues from the test users with the website. Although the website was easy to use, user friendly and had some problems, the prototype visual version of the redesigned website was made and handed to the client.
