This book is a fast-paced and thorough re-evaluation of what heritage tourism means to the people who experience it. It draws on contemporary thinking in human geography and heritage studies, and applies it to a sector of tourism that is both pervasive yet poorly researched in terms of the perspective of tourists themselves. In a series of lucid and tightly argued chapters, it traces the use of semiotics as an analytical tool from its theoretical origins in text, through the all-important dynamics of visuality into an expanded realm of feeling and sensuality. Challenging assumptions about the.

Abstract.
Tavira : exploring and getting to know
Tanzania is endowed with cultural heritage sites with remains, which represent both human cultural and biological evolution from the Pliocene to modern era. Later pre-historic sites include the rock art shelters of Kondoa central Tanzania and historical monuments along the Tanzanian coast precisely Bagamoyo. The presence of these sites contributes greatly to the development of cultural tourism in the mentioned areas. But despite this immense contribution, vandalism, destruction and looting of cultural heritage resources are increasing at an alarming rate. In rescuing the situation, various efforts has been done by public and private institutions to develop regulations to protect, document and conserve pre-historical and historical sites. The efforts have resulted in the development of management plans for some sites while others have succeeded to be listed as World Heritage Sites. Recently, historic sites in Bagamoyo have been in critical situation following the increased destruction. As a result, various actions including nominating the site to the World Heritage Site list has been taken to rescue the situation. The current research was conducted to find out the preparatory actions undertaken to list Bagamoyo as a World Heritage Site as well as factors delaying the process. The research went further to find out the public awareness of cultural heritage resources and the whole process of nomination. The research applied both ethnographic enquiry techniques, namely questionnaires and interviews to retrieve the information from the public. A visit to several historical sites in Bagamoyo was also conducted to supplement data obtained from the ethnographic techniques. Findings revealed that a large number of residents are aware of the existence of cultural heritage sites in Bagamoyo with little knowledge on their values. This study also reveals that the ruins and historical buildings are by themselves inadequate to serve as a strong pulling base to list the town as an endangered site without incorporating the Slave and Ivory Route. It is therefore recommended to the Antiquities Division to persuade the UNESCO through various stakeholders to declare Bagamoyo a world heritage for UNESCO World Heritage List.
