Iliad I provides the commentary and student aids lacking in larger volumes of Homer's work. It contains a full Introduction designed to highlight the most important features of the text. There are sections on the Iliad and its qualities, the Homeric question, dating, oriental influences, style, gods, men, the transmission of the text, the scholia, the epic dialect, and metre. The Commentary, as well as containing material addressed to advanced readers, is also designed to be accessible to those who are new to Homer. To this end, Greek quotations in the Introduction and Commentary are translated, and technical discussions are marked off in square brackets (beginners may pass over them if they wish). The Greek text of Iliad I is printed with a facing English translation of a literal kind, primarily intended to help beginners to construe the Greek and there is also a full vocabulary list.
