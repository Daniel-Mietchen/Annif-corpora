"The psychological impact of dealing with the stress of the daily management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be arduous and challenging. Yet this area is rarely discussed in medical settings despite the fact that the emotional context can undermine the person's ability to stay motivated in the essential self-care tasks that are vital for good health.Diabetes and Wellbeing presents a range of research-based psychological principles that have been demonstrated to positively impact emotional wellbeing. It covers a broad spectrum of diabetes care from managing the initial diagnosis, overcoming depression and diabetes 'burnout', dealing effectively with fears and anxiety, managing food and weight issues and eating disorders, coping with the impact of sexual difficulties, and communicating with healthcare professionals.Jen Nash effectively guides the reader through strategies for better management of the issues associated with living with diabetes, moving individuals towards greater physical and psychological wellbeing and - as a result - a healthier future. This innovative yet practical guide is invaluable for individuals living with diabetes, those supporting others with diabetes, and healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with diabetes"--

Executive coach and psychologist Marshall Goldsmith discusses the emotional triggers that set off a reaction or a behavior in us that often works to our detriment. Do you find that at times you suddenly become defensive or enraged by an idle comment from a colleague? Or that your temper rises when another car cuts you off in traffic? Your reactions don't occur in a vacuum. They are the result of emotional and psychological triggers that often happen only in specific settings -- at meetings, or in competitive situations, or with a specific person who rubs you the wrong way, or when you feel under particular pressure. Being able to recognize those triggers and understand how the environment affects our behavior is key to controlling our responses and managing others at work and in life. Make no mistake -- change is hard. And the starting point is the willingness to accept help, and the desire to change. Over the course of this book, Marshall explores the power of active questions to get us to take responsibility for our actions -- and our failure to act. Questions such as "Did I do my best to make progress toward my goal?" "Did I work hard at being fully engaged?" He discusses the importance of structure in effecting permanent change. Because, he points out, change is hard, and without a structure to keep us on track, we inevitably relapse and fall back. Filled with stories from Marshall's work with executives and leaders, Triggers shows readers how to achieve meaningful and sustained change that will allow us to open our imaginations and escape the rigidity of binary thinking.
