The Multiannual Roadmap for the EGVI contractual Public Private Partnership (2014-2020) is the document of reference for the establishment of the European Green Vehicles Initiative. The text is based on the outcome of a consultation process launched in 2012, involving the stakeholders from ERTRAC, EPoSS and SmartGrids, and takes into account the relevant roadmaps prepared by these three European Technology Platforms. The document presents the elements of context calling for the creation of the EGVI PPP, in continuity of the Green Cars Initiative, and explains the long-term vision developed by the industrial sectors involved. The Roadmap also defines the scope of the Initiative, which aims at accelerating research, development and demonstration of technologies allowing the efficient use of clean energies in road transport, and outlines the research and innovation strategy implemented with a view to increasing the energy efficiency of vehicles and alternative powertrains. It describes the governance model of the contractual public private partnership and includes - in annex - the full list of members involved in the European Green Vehicles Initiative Association.

Kitchin's road transport law 1981 : a summary of the legislation affecting the construction, equipment and use of motor vehicles
Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues
