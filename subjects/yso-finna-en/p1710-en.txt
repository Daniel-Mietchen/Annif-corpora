Occupational Therapy and Stroke guides newly qualified occupational therapists (and those new to the field of stroke management) through the complexities of treating people following stroke. It encourages and assists therapists to use their skills in problem solving, building on techniques taught and observed as an undergraduate. Written and edited by practising occupational therapists, the book acknowledges the variety of techniques that may be used in stroke management and the scope of the occupational therapist's role. Chapters span such key topics as early intervention and the the.

The purpose of the study was to explain the effects of risk factor targeted lifestyle counselling intervention on quality of lifestyle counselling and on adherence to lifestyle change in stroke patients. Content and characteristics of stroke patient counselling was described (I) with narrative literature review (n=33). Lifestyle habits of hospital-admitted stroke patients were described and explained (II) with cross-sectional design (n=150). Quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design explained (III) the effects of lifestyle counselling intervention on working-age stroke patients' adherence to lifestyle change (n=75/group). Cross-sectional, explorative between-groups prospective design explained (IV) associations between the quality of counselling and adherence to lifestyle change during the 12-month follow-up (n=98).The literature data was gathered from the databases and analysed with content analysis (I). The empirical data was collected with Lifestyle (II), Adherence to Lifestyle Change (III, IV) and Counselling Quality (IV) instruments. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, cross-tabulation of variables, logistic regression, and ANCOVA were used for data analysis.Counselling was described with seven themes: information about the disease and concerns regarding stroke, aims of counselling, counselling methods, interaction as a method for counselling, stroke nurse as a counsellor, emotional support and decision making in patient care (I). Patients were overweight or obese (75%) and 86.7% had high waist circumference levels. They generally had rather unhealthy eating habits, were physically inactive and quite highly stressed, and 33.5% drank to excess every month or every week, and 32.9% were current smokers (II). After intervention the experimental group lost their weight at 3 and 6 months, reduced cigarette consumption at 3 months, and increased smoking cessation at 6 months. The experimental group received more support from nurses, family and friends (III). Lifestyle counselling quality was estimated rather good, with the exception of patient-centred counselling, and significantly better by the experimental group. Interactiveness, resources, and advantages of counselling were related to adherence variables (IV). Intervention had effects on lifestyle counselling quality and on adherence to lifestyle change in the short term.

"Crossing the boundaries of classically delineated medical and surgical specialties including neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and neurology, Interventional Neuroradiology uses advanced neuroimaging combined with endovascular techniques to guide catheters and devices through blood vessels to treat disease involving structures of the head, neck, and central nervous system. Through the combination of the latest imaging modalities and microdevice delivery, interventional neuroradiologic techniques are currently revolutionizing therapy of many of the most common neurological and neurosurgical disorders. These advances now provide noninvasive treatment for many disorders that were previously treated only with open surgical techniques, and make treatments possible for many patients - who until recently would have had no acceptable therapeutic options"--Provided by publisher.
