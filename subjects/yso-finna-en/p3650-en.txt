Factors influencing the choice of entry mode in Russia
The systematic and adequate maintenance of historical buildings is essential for their preservation. The same goes for monumental buildings - churches, palaces, archaeological sites - and utilitarian buildings like schools, hospitals factories selected for preservation and those "architettura minore" - the traditional edifices representing local craftmanship and use of local materials and techniques, architecture without arhitects, such as the wooden constructions found in Finland's countryside and towns. What happens when the maintenance is not sufficient, when it is necessary to apply conservation methods or even restoration to prevent further losses and deterioration, to ensure the preservation of the monument? Are restoration principles valid when treating wooden architecture?.

Timber construction tomorrow
The customer of this project is Kontio company - a Finnish construction company specialized in the creating and building of individual wooden houses and administrative wooden buildings. A big part of their sales come from the Russian market. The goal of this project is creating of modular wooden kindergarten for sale in Russia. Research in the thesis is carried out in two directions. The first of them is an analysis of Russian fire resistance regulations, energy efficiency norms and soundproofing usage rules and also observing laminated wood as main building material for a kindergarten. The second part is design of a building. The drawings and a 3D model of the building were created with ArchCad and AutoCad programs. During the work, three types of modules for the building were designed. One version of the building is shown in the thesis. The plan of the floor, the facades, the sections and a 3D model were designed for this version. The customer company can use these modules in the future to create a building of different sizes and forms.

The building of Horyu-ji : the technique and wood that made it possible
This study is based on a commissioned market research for Honkarakenne Oyj. A short summary of the market research is included in this study. The aim of this study was to identify the factors influencing the choice of entry mode in Russia. In addition, the authors tried to identify the approach and the most suitable development mode for the case company. The theoretical framework lists the entry mode possibilities and the factors and approaches in choosing the entry/development mode.  This study was a qualitative study and was conducted as a case study. The data collection was done by interviewing the representative of the case company and an expert on the Russian market. Honkarakenne currently operates on the Russian market through exporting their products directly through a foreign-based distributor. The company owns a minority share in a lumber mill in the Republic of Karelia. According to the findings, the main factor influencing the choice of entry mode was the perceived risk on the Russian market. The risks consist of political, legal and business risks. The other factors influencing the choice were the previous experiences from the market, large amount of investment needed, profitability, prejudice, the flow of information and the company policy.  In the authors̕ opinion, the most suitable long-term development mode for the case company would be to invest directly in an own production facility. This suggestion is based on the authors̕  knowledge gained from the market research, comparison of development modes and experts opinion.

The Seurasaari open-air museum was established in 1909, when the first group of 13 buildings, The Niemelä tenant farm from Central Finland, was relocated to Seurasaari. Today, the open-air museum includes 89 separate buildings acquired comprehensively throughout Finland for the collection. The buildings represent various social classes and typical examples of wood architecture from the 17th to the 20th centuries. A four-member building conservation working group works with the Seurasaari museum buildings all year long. The work is based on an in-depth understanding of the history of the buildings, the traditional materials and building techniques as well as following the international principles of conservation and museum work. The tools required for preserving the buildings are research, preventive conservation, technical conservation and restoration.

Wood architecture
"Horyu-ji temple was first erected in the 7th century and has come down to us today in the magnificent form it achieved in 711, over 1,300 years ago. It has given lie to the common misconception that wood is destined to quickly rot and decay, and has demonstrated the enduring value of wood, not to mention the fact that the temple has been designated a World Heritage Site as the earth's oldest wooden structure. Here Tsunekazu Nishioka, the master carpenter who undertook the repair of this monumental structure in the mid 20th century, shares the insights and knowledge he gained from that experience. To make Nishioka's words and observations more easily understood by later generations, Jiro Kohara has buttressed them with scientific experiments and commentary, bringing into sharp view Hory-ji's long-concealed mysteries and secrets. The result is a revealing picture of Japan's immemorial love of trees and wood, a broad-ranging introduction to the country's wood culture." from back cover.
