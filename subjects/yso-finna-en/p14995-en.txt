[Mainspring Press Digital's first multimedia production, The ragtime discography combines text, images, and audio files to document the full spectrum of historic ragtime recordings. Building on the author's 2003 Cakewalks, rags and novelties, this work has been expanded to cover records issued through the end of 78-rpm production. The existing entries have been updated based on newly discovered primary-source materials, and hundreds of U.S. and foreign cylinders and 78s of all eras have been added. The ragtime discography contains the most detailed discographic data to be found, largely from the original company recording files and catalogs. As a bonus, you'll find full-color reproductions of more than 50 rare sheet-music cover, along with 98 early ragtime recordings expertly digitized in MP3 format.]
