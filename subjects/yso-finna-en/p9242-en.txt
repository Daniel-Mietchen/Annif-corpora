The name and nature of tragicomedy
Bluebeard
Veitset leikkaa ilman : pohjoinen tragedia neljässä henkilössä = Knives cut the air : a northern tragedy in four characters
I don't like where this is going
In one person : a novel
A provocative and biting tragicomedy of greed and corruption. Blind, deaf, and disfigured, the 197 citizens of the Village of Liven enjoy a peaceful lifestyle. But when an unseasonal snowstorm wipes out the grain crops, a county official convinces the villagers to set up a travelling freak-show showcasing their disabilities. Yan boldly plunges into the psychic gap between China's decades-old conditioned response to communist doctrine and its redefinition of itself as a capitalist power, creating with bold, carnivalesque strokes a heartbreaking story of greed, corruption, and the dangers of utopia.
