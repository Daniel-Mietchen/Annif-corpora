The authors divide the book into three easy to read sections. Part One provides the reader with an overview of the 'anorexic' and 'bulimic' personality. The reader is informed of the sociological complexity of eating for the person with anorexia or bulimia and the immense turmoil a sufferer experiences in maintaining food/body control. For the sufferer this control defines who they are; that is their sense of self worth

Getting better bit(e) by bit(e) : a survival kit for sufferers of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorders
The binge/purge syndrome called bulimia is a much misunderstood condition, and one which is increasing in our diet-obsessed society. Sufferers may be of average weight, with no apparent signs of food aversion or obsession, yet their eating habits are totally out of control. This book provides a clear and supportive account of what bulimia is, how it differs from anorexia, and how it can be tackled and defeated. Information, reassurance and sound advice are sensitively balanced in this book, which provides sufferers, their families, friends and doctors with the key to unlocking the hidden nightmare of bulimia.
Obesity and binge eating disorder
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia: how to help
In an extensively revised new edition of the successful Anorexia and Bulimia, Richard Gordon includes new information and discussion of the latest ideas in this rapidly growing research field. There is extensive discussion of the clinical aspects of disorders, in particular their relationship to obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, plus data of recovery and mortality. It also provides accounts of the latest research on the epidemiological status of eating disorders and the subsequent debate that this work has engendered. Further new features include the analysis of the role of sexual abuse in eating disorders; the relationship of obesity to anorexia and bulimia, and consideration of the recent debates surrounding the politics of eating disorders. The past two decades have witnessed an enormous increase in the number of cases of eating disorders in industrial societies. Richard Gordon brings together historical and cultural perspectives, as well as his own clinical experience, in order to examine the sociocultural roots of this apparent epidemic. The high incidence of these once rare conditions in contemporary societies can be traced to a number of interrelated factors: the changing role of women, the increasingly difficult transition from adolescence to adulthood, the social importance attached to physical beauty which focuses on thin body shape, a general pursuit of health and fitness and, ironically, the glamorization of anorexia in the mass media which has made its symptoms fashionable.

Handbook of treatment for eating disorders
At least 40 skin signs are associated with eating disorders (EDs), and some of them are considered guiding signs because they are indicative of an otherwise hidden ED. These skin signs may arise due to starvation, self-induced vomiting, drug consumption, and concomitant psychiatric illness. The role of the dermatologist in this context is to suspect the presence of a hidden ED based on the guiding signs. With this in mind, the most important specialists in the field come together in this book to document all of the dermatological aspects of EDs. General topics such as classification of EDs, epidemiology, and medical complications are first addressed, and skin signs attributable to various causes are then discussed in a series of detailed chapters. Characteristic changes in the hair, nails, and oral cavity are also carefully documented. The closing chapters address various other related issues of interest, including pain sensitivity in patients with EDs and the effects of anorexia nervosa on skin thickness and skin collagen. Eating Disorders and the Skin will be an invaluable source of up-to-date information for both novice and experienced dermatologists, as well as other practitioners with an interest in EDs, psychiatrists, and nurses.

Eating your heart out
The contents of this thesis focuses on eating disorders among adolescents. The topic was chosen, because eating disorders are a growing global health problem with high mortality, and adolescents are the biggest risk group for developing them. Providing a reliable source of information may help prevent adolescent eating disorders by educating the public. The task of this project was to create web pages on eating disorders with a main focus on creating a guide which will provide a source of reliable information about eating disorders. This project focuses on the three main groups of eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). There was an extensive literature review done in order to accomplish the webpages and make the information provided on the webpages reliable. The information provided in this thesis will be published in Terveysnetti, a health informative website containing public information about health and illness issues. To be able to recognize eating disorders among adolescents, the three main groups of eating disorders have been identified in this project, with their symptoms and ways of recognition, possible risk factors and treatment. The risk factors have been divided into three groups: biological, psychological and social risk factors. The treatment methods were discussed only briefly, since this project aims to educate the public about eating disorders, not to provide instructions for their management.
