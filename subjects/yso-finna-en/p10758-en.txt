This book explores social factors that influence well-being, as well as the relationship between these factors. It examines individual areas of social policy from the perspective of children's well-being, gender equity, and the impact of crime and social capital. The book discusses the relationships of well-being with the provision of public services, with developing a sense of community, and dimensions of happiness in nations. Bringing together perspectives from around the globe, the book provides both theoretical and applied explorations. It links the idea of influencing social factors and outcomes to community well-being, thus adding a new perspective. In doing so, it reflects the new and exciting research that is being conducted at the intersection between social factors, policy, impacts, and community well-being.

Global Megatrends tells a story about how the world will change over the next 20 years. "Megatrends" are gradual yet powerful trajectories of change that have the potential to throw companies, individuals and societies into freefall. In Global Megatrends, author Stefan Hajkowicz identifies seven patterns of global change: resource scarcity; the challenge to protect biodiversity and the global climate; the world's ageing demographic; digital technology transformation; rapid economic growth and urbanization in the developing world; societal and consumer expectation for experiential goods and services; and finally a world where human innovation makes (just about) anything possible. This book captures the thinking of many dedicated scientists and researchers who have devoted their careers to exploring and understanding change. The change heralded by megatrends lies beyond our direct control but not beyond our influence. By getting a picture of how the world is changing and what these megatrends are, we can alter our destiny.

"Understanding Poverty" provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the analysis of poverty and social exclusion covering the definition, measurement, distribution and causes of poverty and the policies developed to combat it. The third edition has been extensively rewritten and expanded to include recent developments in research and policy, while maintaining the successful broad approach of earlier editions. In particular, coverage of poverty dynamics and social exclusion has been expanded, with chapters covering targeted anti-poverty action and the new programmes developed since 1997.
