Abstract. - Yhteenveto.
Transplant patients undergoing nontransplant surgeries are increasingly common. In Finland, an anaesthesia nurse is responsible for the planning, preparation and monitoring of anaesthesia during surgery together with the anaesthetist. The purpose of the thesis was to examine the special considerations and recommendations in anaesthesia nursing of a kidney transplant patient. The thesis focused on the perioperative care of a kidney transplant patient, and a Finnish anaesthesia nurse's role in implementing it. The objective was to increase nurses' and nursing students' knowledge on kidney transplant patients' anaesthesia considerations.  Information was gathered by conducting a literature review. The core themes, kidney transplant patients and anaesthesia nursing, formed the basis for the literature search. Ten articles from reliable sources were selected and critically analysed. The results describe the advisable nursing interventions considering a kidney transplant patient's anaesthesia during surgery.  The results indicate that preparing a kidney transplant patient's anaesthesia requires careful consideration. A kidney transplant and the end-stage renal disease leading to it affect many aspects of perioperative care, such as medication, fluid therapy and the surgical position. Thus it is essential to comprehend a kidney transplant's effects on the patient and their anaesthesia. Further studies on different transplant patients' anaesthesia nursing would be beneficial in order to increase the safety of all transplant patients.
