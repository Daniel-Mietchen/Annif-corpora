"The concept of epigenetics has been known about since the 1940s, but it is only in the last 10 years that research has shown just how wide ranging its effects are. It is now a very widely-used term, but there is still a lot of confusion surrounding what it actually is and does. Epigenetics brings together the structure and machinery of epigenetic modification, how epigenetic modification controls cellular functions, and the evidence for the relationship between epigenetics and disease. It will therefore be an invaluable source of information about all aspects of this subject for undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals alike. Topics included are the role of epigenetics in stem cells, the involvement of epigenetics with cancer, and the role of epigenetics in mental health. Key Features - Describes the two forms of epigenetic modification, DNA methylation and histone acetylation, and how they take place. - Section on how epigenetics controls cell function, including cellular differentiation and consequently the role of epigenetics in stem cells - Section on the role of epigenetics in disease only includes diseases where there is clear evidence of epigenetic involvement - Glossary explaining all the terms involved in epigenetics - Full-color figures"--Provided by publisher.
