This political analysis of Harry Potter uses the beloved wizarding world to introduce readers to the equally murky and intimidating world of the political. Readers may be surprised to discover that in fact J. K. Rowling's work provides us with entries into all of the most important political questions in history - from current controversies about terrorism and human rights, to the classic foundations of political thought.

The celebrated orators and speeches of ancient Athens have been read and enjoyed for thousands of years. Focusing on the works of three of the greatest orators in history-Demosthenes, Lysias, and Hypereides-this collection of speeches is an indispensable source for anyone interested in classical civilization and literature, political science and rhetoric. Each of the three sections-The Thirty Tyrants, Philip and Athens, and Athens Under Alexander-includes an introduction providing an historical overview of the period and each speech is preceded by its own brief introduction. Rendered in lively, readable prose, the translations capture the energy, vigor and power of the originals.
