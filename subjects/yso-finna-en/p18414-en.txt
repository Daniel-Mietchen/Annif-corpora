This paper is an overview on the Open Government Data (OGD) environment in the EU. It aims to point out the relevant legal issues together with the economic aspects arising from the disclosure and exploitation of OGD. Therefore, the paper highlights the noteworthy technological aspects related with the opening of OGD datasets. This survey is based on an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinarity in the digital environment means that OGD should be considered as an integrated, interoperable and collaborative ecosystem. The main legislative source taken into account for the survey is the Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information as recently amended by the Directive 37/2013/EU..

The politics of reality television : global perspectives
The aim of this thesis was to create an action plan in order to help Filmaattiset Oy succeed on global markets to sell its products, which are TV-formats and TV-programs. Filmaattiset has been domestic player till recent years, but the idea of this thesis was to create several ideas for facilitating international TV-format sales. With fresh ideas the company might be able to expand their revenue base abroad too. Methods used were interviews, business books and author's subjective views and development ideas. Some strategy tools were used in order to conduct analytical conclusions. Results were concrete and feasible. They range from brand building to innovative ways of TV-format creation and improved sales strategies on global markets. Some of the results have a direct effect to increase sales and some have indirect effect, which may not be measurable. First Filmaattiset must give more profound focus on its brand entity, second TV-formats should and can be created better and finally global sales can be planned and executed better.
