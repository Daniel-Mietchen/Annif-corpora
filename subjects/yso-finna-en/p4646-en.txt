Wine science : the application of science in winemaking
Winemaking is as old as civilization itself, and this illuminating volume takes a unique approach to that history: by exploring 100 bottles that have had the biggest impact on the evolution of wine. Moving from the first cork tops to screw caps, renowned wine writer Oz Clarke presents such landmarks as the introduction of the cylindrical wine bottle in the 1780s; the first estate to bottle and label its own wine (formerly sold in casks to merchants only); the most expensive bottle sold at auction and the oldest unopened bottle; the change in classifications; and the creation of numerous famous vintages.
