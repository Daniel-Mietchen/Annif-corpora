"PowerPoint has become an integral part of academic and professional life across the globe. In this book, Hubert Knoblauch offers the first complete analysis of the PowerPoint presentation as a form of communication. Knoblauch charts the diffusion of PowerPoint and explores its significance as a ubiquitous and influential element of contemporary communication culture. His analysis considers the social and intellectual implications of the genre, focusing on the dynamic relationships between the aural, visual and physical dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, as well as the diverse institutional contexts in which these presentations take place. Ultimately, Knoblauch argues that the parameters of the PowerPoint genre frames the ways in which information is presented, validated and absorbed, with ambiguous consequences for the acquisition and transmission of knowledge. This original and timely book is relevant to scholars of communications, sociology and education"-- Provided by publisher.

The purpose of this thesis is to create presentation material for a long-term saving solution. The sponsor was the Espoo-Tapiola branch of Sampo Bank. Branch personnel will use the material in customer meetings to present the long-term saving solution. The long-term saving solution became available in the Finnish market on April 1 2010. Because this was a new product offering, there was a genuine need for presentation material. Research and implementation started in the beginning of 2010 and continued until May of 2010. The theoretical framework was based on main areas - The long-term saving act, sales process, product and saving objects (equities, bonds, mutual funds and saving account) as well as visualized information, visual representation, visual perception and design principles are discussed. The study was carried out as a product type thesis. The analytical approach was qualitative. Based on the literature review a framework was created for the implementation process. The implementation began by identifying a theme for each slide (the concepts of long-term saving, withdrawal, product in a nutshell, and international opportunities in investing) and creating a template with a colour scheme and typeface. The framework consisted of three phases: pre-processing, visual mapping and design. During pre-processing, information selection and creation of mental model of the key message were made for each slide. In visual mapping, graphical elements were mapped with graphical properties. Visual perception was used to encode the key message with pre-attentive attributes to create a focal point. During the design phase, the focal point and unified look were evaluated. As a result of this thesis, the presentation material for a long-term saving solution was created. The sponsor, Sampo Bank, benefits by being able to use the material in customer meetings. As a secondary outcome, the framework can be used in designing presentation material in the future. The purpose of the material is to support the discussion of the long-term saving solution in the product presentation phase of the sales process. The presentation material was produced with PowerPoint since it can be presented by computer and flip chart. In conclusion, the purpose of this thesis was achieved. The employers of Espoo-Tapiola branch of Sampo Bank can use the presentation material in customer meetings to present the long-term saving solution and further develop it.
