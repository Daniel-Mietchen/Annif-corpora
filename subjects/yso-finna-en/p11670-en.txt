reinforced concrete
"With numerous practical step-by-step examples to illustrate the analysis and design of steel and composite members and connections, this book provides an integrated and comprehensive introduction to the analysis and design of steel and steel-concrete composite structures. It describes the fundamental behavior of steel and composite members and structures and the latest design criteria and procedures. Each section covers the necessary fundamentals for its respective material, but the integration provides further practical insight not possible in independent textbooks. "--

"This fourth edition of a bestselling textbook has been extensively rewritten and expanded in line with the current Eurocodes. It presents the principles of the design of concrete elements and of complete structures, with practical illustrations of the theory. It explains the background to the Eurocode rules and goes beyond the core topics to cover the design of foundations, retaining walls, and water retaining structures. The text includes more than sixty worked out design examples and more than six hundred diagrams, plans, and charts. It suitable for civil engineering courses and is a useful reference for practicing engineers. "--

"This book examines the various problems caused by non-uniform deformation changes, poor durability, and natural and human disasters such as earthquakes and fire. Attention is given to the causes and mechanisms of the deterioration." "Students and academics worldwide will find this an invaluable source of information. It is also useful as a practical tool book for concrete and structural engineering professionals."--BOOK JACKET.
