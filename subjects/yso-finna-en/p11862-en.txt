The year is 1922. The Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Spindletop was discovered 20 years ago, and most of the oil reserves in East Texas have been claimed. But a new drilling site in the Permian Basin has oil companies turning west, urging landowners to sink every last cent into petrileum. Now is your chance to find the next gusher before your neighbor beats you to it. Prepare to strain your overalls in Texas tea as you servey the barren landscape in search of Black Gold.
