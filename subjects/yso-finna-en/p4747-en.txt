The economics of waste
Electrocoagulation (EC) is an emerging technology that combines the functions and advantages of conventional coagulation, flotation, and electrochemistry in water and wastewater treatment. The aims of this work included doing an updated literary review of recent feasible applications of EC, which were found to be plentiful. Since the economic and practical operational key figures related to EC haven’t been extensively mapped out before, this was a prime objective of this part of the work.The aim of the next part of this work was to find new feasible applications for EC in the treatment of water and wastewater. The studied wastewaters included bio- and synthetic oil-in-water emulsions, various industrial nutrient-containing wastewaters, and peat bog drainage water containing humic substances (an interesting and topical problem, especially in Finland). These studies proved the feasibility of EC. In addition, larger-scale experiments were also conducted successfully, thus proving the scalability of the EC process. Extensive economic analyses of the studied EC applications were also done. The operational costs and energy consumption of EC were found to be very low—typically about 0.1–1.0 €/m3 and 0.4–4.0 kWh/m3.It has been forecasted that in the future there will be a shortage of virgin phosphorus. Therefore, another essential purpose of this work was to conduct a preliminary study on the feasibility of using EC for nutrient (especially phosphorus, but also nitrogen) removal and recovery from different types of real wastewater. Specifically, it may be possible to use EC sludges containing notable amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen as additives in granulated bio ash-based fertilizer products for various applications. This is a novel idea and a “hot topic” in the waste utilization sector and in circular and bioeconomy.^

Unplugging drainage : toward sociotechnical redesign of San Joaquin Valley's agricultural drainage management
This study deals with waste collection and treatment of the households in Addis Ababa. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the current amount and composition of the waste as well as collection and disposal methods in the city.  Based on the analysis a model is developed and a justified suggestion on suitable waste treatment tailored for the specific case. A sample of 45 000 inhabitants was taken as a case in this study. Due to financial and time constraint, the study was conducted based on literature survey and search. It was found that majority of the household waste is organic in its nature. The most suitable treatment method for treating this organic waste would be windrow composting. At the current status, all the waste from the city is being disposed in Repi open dump site without further treatment which has wide range of environmental consequences including methane production.  According to the model developed in this study the estimated final cost of waste treatment is cheaper than the amount requested by the local collection cost in the short and long term. In addition, it has a potential to be expanded to the whole Addis Ababa population.

By explaining the lean system for identifying and eliminating waste and introducing efficiency in every aspect of the farm operation, The Lean Farm makes the case that small-scale farming can be an attractive career option for young people who are interested in growing food for their community. Working smarter, not harder, also prevents the kind of burnout that start-up farmers often encounter in the face of long, hard, backbreaking labor. Lean principles grew out of the Japanese automotive industry, but they are now being followed on progressive farms around the world. Using examples from his own familyś one-acre community-supported farm in Indiana, Hartman clearly instructs other small farmers in how to incorporate lean practices in each step of their production chain, from starting a farm and harvesting crops to training employees and selling goods. While the intended audience for this book is small-scale farmers who are part of the growing local food movement, Hartmanś prescriptions for high-value, low-cost production apply to farms and businesses of almost any size or scale that hope to harness the power of lean in their production processes. - Amazon.com.
This study will discuss the recycling behaviour among students who live in student residences provided by the University of Abertay Dundee (UAD) in the city of Dundee, Scotland. Background to the topic is introduced with facts about the waste management procedures in Europe and in Scotland and the issues that arise from waste in order to explain the reader why this particular subject was thought to be important and thus why it was chosen. The questionnaire used in the survey will also be introduced as well as its design and the questions, in order to explain what exactly was wanted from the questionnaire. The relationship between habits in the past and future behaviour is observed, as well as the correlation between attitudes and intentions. The results and analysis from the questionnaire are discussed later on in the Results and Analysis section. Suggestions to future actions are also introduced as well as the conclusions.
