This thesis gives a deeper understanding of destination marketing and  branding in a wider sense. More specifically, the main focus is put on the  brand communication through websites of regional destination marketing  organizations in Germany. The work demonstrates the complexity of the  destination branding process and that this is something very difficult to  influence and to lead. The significance of promoting and communicating a  destination brand shows that destination marketing is as much a strategic  as it is a tactical process. Especially, destination branding is closely linked  to strategic processes as it is also linked to the destination image.  Designing and acceptance of a brand requires a close involvement of all  destination stakeholders. Nowadays, this process is strongly influenced by  technology development such as Internet. Websites provide cheap and  effective marketing tool for destinations, as well as the chance to develop  and customize destination portals. The project-based thesis shows the  principles and potential of destination websites as marketing tool. Thus,  the project outcome of this thesis is a suggestion of a renewed website in  terms of content structure and design. The designing process of the  website included several internal meetings with a decision maker from the  contracting marketing organization during a period of four months. Results  of the project indicate that destination marketing organizations find the  development and maintenance of an attractive destination portal difficult  and costly since there is often a lack of budgets, know-how, time, and  personnel resources for such marketing activities.

For twenty-five years, Studies in Outdoor Recreation has been a standard text in courses on parks and outdoor recreation and serves as an invaluable reference for park and recreation managers. The first book to integrate the social science literature on outdoor recreation, it reviews studies from this broad, interdisciplinary field and synthesizes them into a body of knowledge, providing an historical perspective on outdoor recreation research and developing its practical management implications. This third edition is completely revised to reflect current research and new concerns in the field. A new chapter examines the emerging issue of sense of place and its relationship to outdoor recreation. The book concludes with twenty principles to guide outdoor recreation management and research. An extensive bibliography and A Guide to the Social Science Literature in Outdoor Recreation lead readers to valuable primary source material. An essential resource for students, scholars, and professionals, Studies in Outdoor Recreation explores the theoretical and methodological issues in outdoor recreation and describes the management implications of outdoor recreation research.
