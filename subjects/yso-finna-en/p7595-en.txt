Abstract: The purpose of this final project was  to identify effective educational interventions designed to improve nurses' and nursing students'  self-reported  cultural competence and   describe the outcome of these interventions. The knowledge gained from this literature   review can be used to further develop and amplify the contents of cultural competence   trainings and improve health care for ethnic minorities. Our final project was part of the   Local and Global Development in Social Services and Health Care (LOG-Sote) project.  The final project consisted of a systematic literature review of 18 research articles, three   literature reviews and one meta-analysis. All the articles were systematically collected from   the databases CINAHL and MEDLINE or extracted manually from bibliographies and high   quality nursing journals.  The findings indicated that cultural competence training is effective in increasing nurses'  and nursing students' self-reported cultural competence. 15 out of the 18 research articles   indicated statistically significant improvements in the cultural competence levels reported   by professional nurses and nursing students after the educational intervention. These findings were also supported by three literature reviews and one meta-analysis. The positive   effect was present regardless of the training method. Effective training methods included   cultural immersion programs, service-learning, class-room and online teaching, DVDs and   other publications.  We found out that there are gaps in research evaluating the effects of nurses' and nursing'   students cultural competence education from the patient outcome perspective.
