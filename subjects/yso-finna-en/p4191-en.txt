The purpose of this thesis was to find out if Hotel Managers in Finland take into consideration employee motivation, and if so, how do they motivate their employees and finally, how do they measure employee motivation.  The literature review deals with what motivates people and how to motivate them. Theoretically, motivation was approached from two perspectives. Firstly motivation was approached from the content theory perspective, which stresses that the importance of motivation is what motivates people. Secondly, process theories were reviewed; which goal is to find out how to motivate people.   This study is methodologically a qualitative case study. Open questions and interviews were used as research methods because since motivation is something difficult to measure the author thought that by interviewing those managers, the responses would be more accurate. Data was collected from to two General Managers and one Hotel Manager from Finland in February 2005. Results were analysed with the case analysis method and cross-analysis method.  On the basis of the results, it seems that the importance that managers give to employee motivation varies from one manager to another. The three managers consider very relevant the topic researched, but from the analysis of the results, it seems they put more effort in how to motivate their staff than to discover what motivates employees. All the managers measure their employee motivation through surveys and they do not believe money to be a motivator.  Also in this research it is visible that each manager performs different strategies in relation with motivation, some of them focus more in applying content theories and others believe more in applying the content theories. But all the interviewed managers do something to have motivated employees.

"The 8 Dimensions of Leadership is the first book to explore leadership through the lens of Inscape's third generation DiSC model of human behavior. This title is designed to paint an inclusive picture of the varied approaches that make for strong leadership. It primarily focuses on the interpersonal realm of leadership and helps readers identify which of the eight approaches comes most naturally to them. This book utilizes and explains the DiSC model to help leaders learn to be more effective in their relationships and leadership roles. Focusing on the reader's individual approach to leadership, the authors use primary literature and the latest research to support the third generation DiSIC model, which illustrates where different leadership styles fall on a simple circular map. Readers will be able to identify their own approach to leadership, explore the strengths and challenges that leaders with each of the approaches faces, and discover strategies for more effective leadership based on their personal approach"--
