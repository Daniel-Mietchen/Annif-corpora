"This volume presents the first English translation of Jesuit Filippo Bonanni's eighteenth-century treatise, considered the most important and comprehensive early study of Chinese lacquer in Europe. Long neglected in the English-speaking world, this text is an invaluable primary source for scholars and conservators working with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century varnished and lacquered works of art. The introduction and translation are by Flavia Perugini, associate objects conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston."--BOOK JACKET.
