Man and nature : an anthropological essay in human ecology
"Humans live in large and extensive societies and spend much of their time interacting socially. Likewise, most other animals also interact socially. Social behaviour is of constant fascination to biologists and psychologists of many disciplines, from behavioural ecology to comparative biology and sociobiology. The two major approaches used to study social behaviour involve either the mechanism of behaviour - where it has come from and how it has evolved, or the function of the behaviour studied. With guest articles from leaders in the field, theoretical foundations along with recent advances are presented to give a truly multidisciplinary overview of social behaviour, for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Topics include aggression, communication, group living, sexual behaviour and co-operative breeding. With examples ranging from bacteria to social mammals and humans, a variety of research tools are used, including candidate gene approaches, quantitative genetics, neuro-endocrine studies, cost-benefit and phylogenetic analyses and evolutionary game theory"--Provided by publisher.

Geography as social science
Treating such issues as animal sex, species politics, environmental justice, lesbian space and "gay" ghettos, AIDS literatures, and queer nationalities, this lively collection asks important questions at the intersections of sexuality and environmental studies. Contributors from a wide range of disciplines present a focused engagement with the critical, philosophical, and political dimensions of sex and nature. These discussions are particularly relevant to current debates in many disciplines, including environmental studies, queer theory, critical race theory, philosophy, literary criticism, and politics. As a whole, Queer Ecologies stands as a powerful corrective to views that equate "natural" with "straight" while "queer" is held to be against nature.

"Through the pages of The Biology of Civilisation, Stephen Boyden is able to show that the worldview and priorities of the world's current dominant culture are simply not compatible with the long-term survival of civilisation. He argues that a shift to an ecologically sustainable and equitable society will not take place without a major transformation in our dominant culture, a 'cultural renaissance'. He concludes the book by suggesting measures that can be taken right now to make this happen." "The Biology of Civilisation will appeal to readers who are interested in issues of human health and wellbeing, ecological and economics sustainability, and the future of our society."--BOOK JACKET.
