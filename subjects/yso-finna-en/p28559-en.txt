Yarn bombing : the art of crochet and knit graffiti
Knit : innovations in fashion, art, design
In the loop : knitting now
Knit is an exciting and dynamic design area, with new technologies opening up a wealth of creative possibilities for designers, as well as innovative uses of traditional techniques. Witty, hyper-real and luxurious designs are being used by fashion designers, while artists, activists, and community groups are reinterpreting the medium to stunning and surprising effect. This showcase of the best knitted textiles around the world is divided into three key areas: fashion, art, and community. In fashion, the book features beautiful and innovative constructions from designers such as Mark Fast, Christian Wijnants, and Sibling. The art chapter includes Annette Streyl's knitted architectural sculptures and Isobel Berglund's floating installations. Examples of experimental public work from guerrilla knitting collectives, such as B-Arbeiten's yarnbombing, is represented in the community section.
