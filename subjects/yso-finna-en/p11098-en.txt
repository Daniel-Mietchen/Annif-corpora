Environmental epidemiologist Morris chronicles the at times frightening story of our drinking water. He recounts the epidemics that have shaken cities and nations, the scientists who reached into the invisible and emerged with controversial truths that would save millions of lives, and the economic and political forces that opposed these researchers in a ferocious war of ideas. In the gritty world of nineteenth-century England, a physician proved that cholera could be hidden in a drop of water. In the twentieth century, burgeoning cities subdued cholera and typhoid by building massive filtration plants, and bubbling poisonous chlorine gas through their drinking water. However, in the new millennium, waterborne disease is threatening to reemerge, and research has linked chlorine treatment with cancer and stillbirths. Morris dispels notions of fail-safe water systems, revealing some shocking truths: miles of leaking water mains, constantly evolving microorganisms, and the looming threat of bioterrorism.--From publisher description.

"This book introduces the use of risk analysis as a tool for responsible environmental decision making in nanotechnology development, providing concise, yet informative, narratives on the topics of toxicology, occupational health and safety, and environmental implications of nanotechnology. This new edition presents new perspectives and provides updates on the technical, societal, and regulatory developments in the field. The text presents historical perspectives, provides an overview of current concerns, summarizes international efforts to address risk, describes methods for evaluating nanotechnology risks, and presents current and proposed approaches for managing those risks"--

Uncertainty in risk assessment : contents and models of communication
The objective of this thesis was to find out what kind of effects crises in the tourism industry have on young travellers. The focus was on large scale crises including terrorism, natural catastrophes and health crises. The intention was to examine further which large scale crises are the most frightening ones, what young travellers would do if some crises occured in their travel destination or on their travel route and also wether media has influence to the concern about crises or not.  The theoretical framework is based on explaining the term crisis and going deeper into large scale crises in the tourism industry including terrorism, natural catastrophes and health crises. In addition, some literature was founded out about the effects of crises on travellers' travel behaviour.  The chosen research method was a quantitative survey for young travellers. The study was conducted by a web-based questonnaire. The target group, young travellers between 18 and 28 years, was reached via social network Facebook. The questionnaire consisted of ten questions including both open-ended and closed-ended questions.  The main result of the survey was that young travellers are not that much concerned about the large scale crises. Surprisingly, the most scared crisis was pandemics which is also the most avoidable one. Males seem to be less worried about crises than females. However, depending on the severity and seriousness of a crisis situation, young travellers are likely to change their travel destination to a safer one.  Young travellers follow news a lot when looking for safety information on a travel destination and that way media has big impact on their travel behaviour, too.

Campylobacter is a leading cause of enteric infections in many countries. The principal reservoir of pathogenic Campylobacter spp. is the alimentary tract of wild and domesticated mammals and birds. FAO and WHO have undertaken a risk assessment of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens. An interpretative summary of that work is described in this volume. This assessment compared the risk for a variety of scenarios and mitigation measures for control of the organism in a range of broiler chicken products. This volume contains information that is useful to both risk assessors and risk managers, governments and food regulatory agencies, industry and other people or institutions with an interest in Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens, the public health impact and the use of risk assessment in the evaluation and selection of potential control strategies--Publisher's description.

Aquaculture is a rapidly expanding sector of the global economy with an average growth rate of 8.8 percent per annum since 1970. This consistent increase in production is a result of expansion of markets, globalization of market access and an increasing market demand for seafood products during a period in which most capture fisheries are stagnating or in decline. Aquaculture is expected to continue to increase its contribution to the world's production of aquatic food and will further strengthen its role in food security and food safety, while also offering opportunities to alleviate poverty, increase employment and community development and reduce overexploitation of natural aquatic resources, thus creating social and generational equity, particularly in developing countries. This rapid development of the industry under various national and regional jurisdictions has resulted in a diversity of regulatory frameworks. Thus, FAO Members have requested guidance on the application of risk analysis with respect to aquaculture production. The purpose of this manual is to provide an overview of the risk analysis process as applied to aquaculture production and to demonstrate the variety of ways in which risk can manifest in aquaculture operations and management. The intention of this manual is to promote wider understanding and acceptance of the applications and benefits of risk analysis in aquaculture production and management. This manual is directed towards decisions-makers and senior aquaculture managers in FAO Members States. It includes an introduction to the methodology used to assess the risks posed by aquaculture operations to the environment, socio-political and economic well-being and cultural values, as well as the risks to aquaculture from outside influences, including potential environmental, socio-political, economic and cultural impacts. The manual contains six sections. Section 1 provides a background to the aquaculture sector and an introduction to the concepts of risk analysis. Section 2 presents the operating environment for risk analysis for the aquaculture sector by briefly reviewing the relevant international frameworks applicable to each risk category. Section 3 discusses a general risk analysis process for aquaculture. Section 4 provides brief overviews of the risk analysis process as applied in each of the seven risk categories. Section 5 briefly summarizes actions that need to be taken by FAO Members to promote the wider use of risk analysis for aquaculture development. Finally, Section 6 discusses future challenges to aquaculture and the role risk analysis might play in addressing them.
Association of obesity and fat distribution in the Finnish population
"Cancer can kill: this fact makes it concrete. Still, it's a devious knave. Nearly every American will experience it up-close and all too personally, wondering why the billions of research dollars thrown at the word haven't exterminated it from the English language. Like a sapper diffusing a bomb, Jain unscrambles the emotional, bureaucratic, medical, and scientific tropes that create the thing we call cancer. Scientists debate even the most basic facts about the disease, while endlessly generated, disputed, population data produce the appearance of knowledge. Jain takes the vacuum at the center of cancer seriously and demonstrates the need to understand cancer as a set of relationships--economic, sentimental, medical, personal, ethical, institutional, statistical. Malignant analyzes the peculiar authority of the socio-sexual psychopathologies of body parts; the uneven effects of expertise and power; the potentially cancerous consequences of medical procedures such as IVF; the huge industrial investments that manifest themselves as bone-cold testing rooms; the legal mess of medical malpractice law; and the teeth-grittingly jovial efforts to smear makeup and wigs over the whole messy problem of bodies spiraling into pain and decay. Malignant examines the painful cognitive dissonances produced by the ways a culture that has relished dazzling success in every conceivable arena have twisted one of its staunchest failures into an economic triumph. The intractable foil to American achievement, cancer hands us -- on a silver platter and ready for Jain's incisively original dissection -- our sacrifice to the American Dream".
