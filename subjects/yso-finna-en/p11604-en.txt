Barry Loser hates half term!
Youth in everyday life contexts
'Fetch!' and 'Sit!' and 'Stay!' I understand them all. Those are the words I know. But what is 'Fred'? Fred the dog may not know his name yet or how to stay out of trouble, but one little boy will love him no matter what. A follow-up to 'I Will Love You Anyway', this touching rhyming story is full of friendship and tail wagging, and will touch a chord with all children who love pets.
A girl, a boy and a deserted reservoir. Cormorance is a story of fear, bravery and the redemptive force of connecting with the natural world. A wordless, purely visual story, it is - like any work by the award-winning Nick Hayes - a book of the utmost beauty, and a wonder to hold in your hand. / WorldCat.
