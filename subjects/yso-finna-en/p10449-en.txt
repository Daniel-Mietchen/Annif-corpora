New small garden : contemporary principles, planting and practice
Small gardens are a challenge to design and to keep looking good. This title aims to inspire and inform gardeners to make the most of their small spaces by looking at more than 50 contemporary and inspirational gardens, at how their designers have created them and how their owners use and develop them. In this serious review of the perennial subject, Noel explains the theory and practice of planting a small garden, he advocates on the use of containers, revitalises growing your own, and explains design tricks, storage solutions and vertical planting to help small garden owners maximise their small spaces. And lack of space should not limit ambition for embracing sustainability, the use of recycled materials and the scope for bio-diversity as well as providing habitats for wildlife. All the gardens featured have been photographed in the last two years. Special photography is by Dutch garden photographer and former fashion stylist Maayke de Ridder whose design rigour perfectly complements the author's gardening expertise.
