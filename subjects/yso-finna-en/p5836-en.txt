Seurasaari open-air museum and conservation of the museum building collection
An intimate account of White House life from the perspectives of the service staff from the Kennedys through the Obamas details their friendships, marriages, everyday activities, and elaborate state dinners.
The Seurasaari open-air museum was established in 1909, when the first group of 13 buildings, The Niemelä tenant farm from Central Finland, was relocated to Seurasaari. Today, the open-air museum includes 89 separate buildings acquired comprehensively throughout Finland for the collection. The buildings represent various social classes and typical examples of wood architecture from the 17th to the 20th centuries. A four-member building conservation working group works with the Seurasaari museum buildings all year long. The work is based on an in-depth understanding of the history of the buildings, the traditional materials and building techniques as well as following the international principles of conservation and museum work. The tools required for preserving the buildings are research, preventive conservation, technical conservation and restoration.
