This Bachelor's thesis was made in cooperation with Wärtsilä Finland Oy and Viking Line Abp. The thesis studies the installation of exhaust gas treatment technology to the M/S Gabriella and challenges brought by it. The thesis also reviews sulfur emission limits set by International Maritime Organization (IMO) for ships that operate inside SECA areas and ways to achieve these limits with exhaust gas treatment technology. Limitations come into force in January 2015. Wärtsilä Finland has developed equipment for exhaust gas treatment that meets the emission limits set by IMO and made an offer for Viking Line of delivering such equipment to M/S Gabriella, which started operating in 1991. Under closer review is the ship itself, its equipment, and changes to be made onboard, Wärtsilä's scrubber appliances, appliance placement and benefits achieved by installation.The main focus is on closed loop fresh water scrubber but also open loop sea water is reviewed and a comparison is made between these two. The thesis attempts to point out the importance of weight management in retrofit projects and search for solutions to this project, which will decrease mass onboard. Although installation is quite challenging, it should be technically possible to execute. The profit achieved in terms of money is relatively significant. Installation of scrubber makes the usage of high sulfur content fuel oil possible, which is remarkably cheaper than low sulfur marine gas oil. All in all the thesis will recommend that installation of such equipment should be made before it is too late. Savings made with the installation annually, even with such aged ship, are enormous when the fuel oil type is changed. All the appliances can be fitted inside the ship reasonably.It is found that there are no problems with the stability and the weight reduction solutions are successful. Changes to the existing structures are relatively minor, where the lengthening of existing funnel can be mentioned as one of the biggest.
