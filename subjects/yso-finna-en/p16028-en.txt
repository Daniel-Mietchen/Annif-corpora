"Fundamentals of Biomechanics introduces the exciting world of how human movement is created and how it can be enhanced. The book presents a comprehensive review of the major concepts of biomechanics and summarizes them in nine principles of biomechanics. It concludes by applying these principles to the work of kinesiology professionals. Specific case studies are presented in physical education, coaching, strength and conditioning, and sports medicine. This text presents a clear, conceptual understanding of biomechanics and is designed to help students link their personal experience to biomechanical concepts." "Biomechanics instructors, researchers, and other professionals helping people to improve movement and decrease the risk of injury, as well as advanced students learning biomechanical principles in biomedical engineering, ergonomics, kinesiology, physics, and sports physiology will find Fundamentals of Biomechanics invaluable."--BOOK JACKET.
