Biodegradation and packaging : a literature review
Polymer nanocomposites are organic-inorganic hybrid materials where the inorganic filler has at least one dimension in the nanometer scale. They have properties that are far superior to those of not only the parent materials but also conventional microcomposites. These include optical, magnetic, thermal, energy-scavenging, biosensing, gas/water barrier, antimicrobial, and biodegradability properties. Two factors are responsible for these superior properties: the interface between polymer and matrix and the confinement of polymer matrix chains at the nanolevel.
