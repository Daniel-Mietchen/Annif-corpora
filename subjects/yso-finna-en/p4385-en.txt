"In 2012, after the overthrow of Qaddafi, the acclaimed novelist Hisham Matar journeys to his native Libya after an absence of thirty years. When he was twelve, Matar and his family went into political exile. Eight years later Matar's father, a former diplomat and military man turned brave political dissident, was kidnapped from the streets of Cairo by the Libyan government and is believed to have been held in the regime's most notorious prison. Now, the prisons are empty and little hope remains that Jaballah Matar will be found alive. Yet, as the author writes, hope is "persistent and cunning." This book is a profoundly moving family memoir, a brilliant and affecting portrait of a country and a people on the cusp of immense change, and a disturbing and timeless depiction of the monstrous nature of absolute power"--

Augustine's way of speaking about God has been frequently deplored. It has been dismissed as too confident regarding the content of its assertions and too narrowly confined. The reception of Augustine's work appears to indicate that there was not a little truth to this view. Augustine's affirmative statements on God's essence and activities constituted the 'initial capital' of Christian theology and spirituality. In contemporary religion, a tendency is in evidence to deny that too specific an image of God can really contain absolute truth. Fully formulated religious truths have to be placed in perspective, or must even be deconstructed, especially if the suspicion arises that they inhibit openness to authentic religious experiences of unity and harmony. Given such an outlook on religion, it seems understandable that those who take contemporary culture's renewed interest in religion seriously ignored Augustine's work as an authoritative source for 'post-Christian' discourse about God.

This collection of Sonja Brentjes' articles deals with travels, encounters and the exchange of knowledge in the Mediterranean and Western Asia during the 16th and 17th centuries, focusing on three historiographical concerns. The first is how we should understand the relationship between Christian and Muslim societies, in the period between the translations from Arabic into Latin (10th - 13th centuries) and before the Napoleonic invasion of Ottoman Egypt (1798). The second concern is the 'Western' discourse about the decline or even disappearance of the sciences in late medieval and early modern Islamic societies and, third, the construction of Western Asian natures and cultures in Catholic and Protestant books, maps and pictures. The articles discuss institutional and personal relationships, describe how Catholic or Protestant travellers learned about and accessed Muslim scholarly literature, and uncover contradictory modes of reporting, evaluating or eradicating the visited cultures and their knowledge.

Aerial photography is marked by its dependency on technological developments in both photography and aerospace, and the authors chart the history of this photography as it tracked the evolution of these technologies. Beginning with early images taken from hot-air balloons, fixed platforms, and subsequent handheld camera technology, Denis Cosgrove and William Fox then explain how military reconnaissance and governmental projects were instrumental in catalyzing these and other innovations in the field. They examine pivotal historical moments in which aerial photography began to establish itself as essential tool, such as in World War II military strategies, high-altitude photography taken from postwar rockets and aircraft, and the use of aerial photography during the cold war and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The book also explores the advancement of geographic scholarship through aerial photography, ranging from military excursions into Antarctica to the images of the curvature of the earth taken during the Apollo space missions.

The use of digital services today has become more and more common. There is a huge amount of information available about products, services and companies for consumers and thus they have become more critical towards information they are offered. Understanding customer need has become more essential when companies have begun to invest in online services. When companies start to put effort on improving online services, their functionality, navigation and information output, customers can have more complete service experience. Me2we Finland Ltd. focuses on project management through crowdsourcing and is the case company in this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was to illustrate Me2we Finland Ltd.’s customer service path and bring out critical points from student-customer perspective by using service design methods. The service path in this context means the steps the customer makes during the service experience, covering the entire process. The use of digital services has become a big part of service industry and it is used in this thesis as a way of utilizing the web site. The platform is used as the only option for customer service in the service process. Customer journey and customer perspective was visualized by utilizing service design methods, such as customer journey and service blueprint and value proposition. Alongside of these methods, business model canvas was used to finding out case company’s current status. The methods used created a description of steps the customer takes while using the service. These steps were arranged through touchpoints, which include the interaction between the customer, platform and company. A workshop was organized for going through the customer journey with potential customers and for clarifying their viewpoint. This thesis followed a five-stage service design process and involved customer viewpoint in order to improve platform’s usage. It can be concluded that describing the digital service path and adding company’s processes enable presenting the path visually and its critical steps in an easy format. Customer participation in the development process was involved through a workshop, then analyzed by observing. The service phases can be presented internally in the company to evaluate and improve the phases to incorporate them as a visible part of company operations. Service design basically enables customer to have more information available and thus might reduce the need for customization and personal guidance of service. The researcher realized that every touchpoint of the service path has risks. Customer journey and service blueprint revealed few critical points that effect on the success of the whole service process.
