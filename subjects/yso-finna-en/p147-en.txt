This report, prepared with the participation of member countries as well as the public and private sectors, demonstrates the central role plant genetic diversity continues to play in shaping agriculture growth in the face of climate change and other environmental challenges. It provides the decision-makers with a technical basis for policy and technical decision to strengthen national efforts. It also aims to attract the attention of the global community to set priorities for the effective management of plant genetic resources for the future. Country reports and thematic studies are available on the accompanying CD-ROM.--Publisher's description.

Finnsheep is one of the most prolific sheep breeds in the world. We sequenced RNA-Seq libraries from the ovaries of Finnsheep ewes collected during out of season breeding period at about 30X sequence coverage. A total of 86 966 348 and 105 587 994 reads from two samples were mapped against latest available ovine reference genome (Oarv3.1). The transcriptome assembly revealed 14 870 known ovine genes, including the 15 candidate genes for fertility and out-of-season breeding. In this study we successfully used our bioinformatics pipeline to assemble the first ovarian transcriptome of Finnsheep.

T helper cells play a profound role in the adaptive immune response. Depending on the antigen, cytokine environment and co-stimulatory signals naїve T helper cells differentiate into distinct subsets, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. These subsets have their own specific tasks and disturbances in their balance can lead to disorders in the immune system, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies and asthma. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms of Th cell differentiation is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disorders. Such knowledge may lead to better ways of diagnosing and providing therapies for these diseases.  This thesis study is part of a larger research project of the Molecular Immunology Group and was carried out at the Turku Centre for Biotechnology during April and May 2010. The original goal of this study was to test a novel method, called mRNA transfection, in studying Th cells. However, the time reserved for this project was too short and therefore the aims of the study were changed and only a part of the original project was performed. The aim of this study was to generate plasmid constructs of four variants of the NFIL3 coding fragment (FLAG-DN-NFIL3, FLAG-NFIL3, DN-NFIL3, NFIL3) by cloning them to the pBluescriptRN3P plasmid vector. Also a construct of the GATA3 coding fragment and pBluescriptRN3P plasmid vector was generated to be used as a control in further functional studies. In addition, the correct constructs were to be linearized for further studies. The goal was to provide useful tools to help the research of Th cells. In this study basic methods of molecular biotechnology, such as DNA digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation and polymerase chain reaction, were used. During this study substantial, unexpected and time consuming problems occurred, which is somewhat typical of scientific research. Due to the faced challenges the original goals were not fully reached. Nevertheless, as a result three out of the five constructs were correctly generated and they can be utilized in further studies.

The Drosophila JNK signaling pathway regulates epithelial cell shape changes during the process of dorsal closure in embryogenesis. Due to mutations in the JNK signaling pathway, the elongation process in the lateral and leading edge cells is disrupted.  Severe morphological defects, including cleft thorax, on the thorax occur in the mutated adult flies. The purpose of this thesis was to study the effect of mitochondrial catalase (mtCAT) on cleft thorax in Drosophila melanogaster. The primary goal was to find out whether the effect of mtCAT can mimic the effect of AOX in terms of rescuing the cleft thorax phenotype. The research method was based on the crossing of flies that carries UAS promoter linked with the GAL4-pnrMD237 with the flies containing RNAi constructs against JNK signaling pathway genes. The results showed that mtCAT can mimic AOX effect on cleft thorax when some of the JNK pathway genes are silenced in the dorsal epithelium. A minor mtCAT rescue effect on the dorsal midline was found after hep knockdown and major rescue after jun knockdown. Similar rescue effect was not observed in kay and msn knockdown. Subsequent research is required to clarify the role of mtCAT in rescue.

A magnificent history of the gene and a response to the defining question of the future: What becomes of being human when we learn to "read" and "write" our own genetic information? Siddhartha Mukherjee has a written a biography of the gene as deft, brilliant, and illuminating as his extraordinarily successful biography of cancer. Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the main quality traits in the parental lines of wheat segregating populations to identify the best for subsequent genetic mapping of the traits. Significant differences (p < 0.001) among wheat genotypes were observed. Many of the examined crosses appeared to be suitable for the purpose, showing differences among parental lines as high as 4.6% for protein content, 6.4% for gluten content, 69 for gluten index, 50 mL for sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation volume, and 33.9 g for thousand-kernel weight, whereas differences accounting for 4.8, 2.4, and 7.3 were observed for yellow index, red index and brown index, respectively. The results pointed out that for studying at the same time the quantitative and qualitative features of gluten, the wheat populations derived from Latino x MG29896 and Saragolla x 02-5B-318 could be particularly appropriate. In addition, the latter cross was suitable to deepen the knowledge of yellow index regulation.
