"Understanding how employees' brains work enables organizations to build cultures, design structures and processes that help people to be more innovative, productive and engaged. This has lasting impact in terms of meeting business objectives and becoming an employer of choice. We need to change the way we manage change in organizations: by understanding the brain we can do this better. Neuroscience brings a new lens through which to look at people and to understand why they react to situations in a certain way, what they need from work relationships to perform at their best, and how they might be better motivated. Neuroscience for Organizational Change not only provides evidence that will persuade the most sceptical of leaders but also provides many practical examples of how to apply the insights. The book provides a 'win-win': it will enable the organization to improve performance and also help to support the mental and emotional well-being of employees. Amongst other areas, Neuroscience for Organizational Change explores why we find organizational change difficult and what we can do to keep people focused and performing at their best. It looks at our need for social connection at work, the essential role that leaders and managers play, how best to manage emotions and reduce bias to avoid making flawed decisions, and why we need communication, involvement and storytelling to help us through change. It also sets out a new science-based planning tool, SPACES, to enhance motivation"--

Change of norm? : in-work poverty in a comparative perspective
Wellness and taking care of ones own health has become trendy and public forces are trying to find out ways to get people more interested of their own health and well being. Also corporations launch wellness and workplace health promotion programs more commonly to reduce employee turnover and to increase company profits. In the future there will be increase in the amount of elderly people in Finland and this emphasizes the need for work related health services and preventive health behaviour. In work environments more focus needs to be laid on motivation and work well being. This creates a demand for wellness event for corporate groups aiming to motivate employees and to stimulate them to exercise to improve their health. The aim of this thesis is to point out factors that are essential when developing a wellness event concept and based on those make a proposal of potential concept for an event and programme organiser. The thesis has two parts: the theoretical frame of reference and a plan of a wellness event concept. The framework is created based on the literature of wellness, workplace health promotion, event marketing, event as a product and event product development. Also the process of wellness event development is descriped based on the descriptions of workplace health promotion, event marketing and event product development. When planning a wellness event for a corporate group the customer needs, expectations, resources and participation level needs to be found out before decisions about the content of the event can be made. Since event as a product is immaterial and it is produced and consumed simultaneously, also the people providing the event are a part of the product and affect the experience of a customer.     In the project part of the thesis a wellness event concept is created. The idea of wellness event  bases on co-operation between an event and programme organiser and a fitness chain. The event is targeted to all companies wanting to motivate the employees to improve their health by exercise. A potential product called Wellness Week is created to give a better picture of the potential event.

The purpose of the thesis was to study the work well-being and orientation, and how they are connected to each other. The first objective was to analyse the issues influencing the work well-being. The second objective was to study the issues concerning the orientation like learning and development. Finally, the research looked into how the orientation can be used for improving the work well-being, performance and working atmosphere.   The need for the thesis came from the lack of a proper orientation program from the commissioning company of Stockmann's Service Point. Books and Internet documents were used as a source for the theoretical part of the thesis. Interviews were used for the empirical part of the thesis, to study the well-being and the orientation process of the Service Point. The information of the study was used for updating the orientation program of the Service Point.  The results of the research showed that the orientation has a major influence for work well-being. The interviews helped to study the common situation of the well-being at Stockmann's Service Point. The results of the interviews showed that the situation of well-being is good at the moment, but the time reserved for orientation is not enough to learn all the tasks needed at work. The information gathered from the study can be used for developing the well-being and the orientation process at the Service Point.

The Welfare of Children with Mentally Ill Parents examines the interventions made by professional workers from a range of different disciplines in families with dependent children and a mentally ill parent. The authors compare responses of professionals in ten European countries and one state in Australia. The analysis of the differences sheds new light on both the inherent and system-determined difficulties in helping families to manage their situation effectively. Features the only comparative study of mental health social services and the law governing compulsory hospital admission Covers a current "hot-button" topic that is growing in importance as the impact of social policy developments on children over time becomes more apparent Offers a unique perspective due to the focus on the impact of children of mentally ill parents and the international systems that deal with child protection.
High levels of psychological well-being amongst employees translate into good news for the organization, including lower sickness-absence levels, attraction and retention of talented people, and more satisfied customers, clients, or service users. People with higher levels of psychological well-being work better, live longer and have happier lives. Engagement and well-being can sustain each other and lead to a healthier and more productive organization, a win-win for employees and employers.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to find out the factors of work engagement of kindergarten teachers and the elements of these factors. Work engagement is one part of work well-being. This final thesis was a qualitative study. The method for collecting data was theme interview, which is a qualitative study method. For this study I interviewed five kindergarten teachers. The data were analyzed by thematic analysis. As a theoretical framework I used work engagement, which is divided into three dimensions: vigor, dedication and absorption. Besides these three dimensions, I studied the factors of work engagement of kindergarten teachers from the perspective of job resources, job demands and personal resources. The results of the study contained information of the factors and elements of work engagement of kindergarten teachers that I was able to categorize into five different stages of work engagement: the core of the work, the organizing of work, the communication and management stage, the organizational stage and the personal stage. All of the three dimensions of work engagement clearly emerged from the data. The results of this study lead to a conclusion that the factors and elements of work engagement of kindergarten teachers are versatile. The results of this study might possibly be of help in strengthening the work engagement factors of kindergarten teachers as well as in recognizing the factors that can negatively influence the experience of work engagement of kindergarten teachers. People who are responsible for developing the field of early childhood education might benefit from the results of this study.

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to clarify the meaning of organizational change and to  identify the process of change as well as how organizational change effects on organization  and its employees' job satisfaction, motivation, well-being and working environment  after the merger in LähiTapiola Lännen. The objective was that the target  organization would benefit from the results of the research and they could use the  results in their future change projects.  The theoretical part deals with organizational change, change process, change management  and employees behavior. It also dealt with how the change effects on organization's  culture and climate.  The empirical part was created based on the theoretical part and the results received  from the research. The empirical part attempts to find out how the target organization's  employees experienced the change process.  The research method used in the thesis had elements of both qualitative and quantitative  research methods and the questionnaire conducted to the employees was made  by web-based e-form. The results received from the questionnaire were analysed  carefully and they were compared with information gathered in the theoretical part.  The results of the research revealed that the change process (merger) in the target  organization was not successful in the employees' opinion but on the other hand,  they did have a strong believe in the future success of the organization. Based on the  results received from the research was created recommendations to the target organization  on how they could perform more effectively in the future change projects.

Abstract: Health care workforce is becoming culturally more diverse globally. Nurses migrating from one country to another might face specific challenges in their integration such as discrimi-nation and language difficulties. Many misunderstandings are likely to occur due to cultural differences.    The purpose of this final project was to chart scientific research articles to introduce management strategies that promote the wellbeing of a culturally diverse nursing staff. The specific research question that was intended to answer was: What kinds of management strategies promote the wellbeing of a culturally diverse nursing staff?    CINAHL database was used to conduct a literature review. Research articles published between 2001-2012 and written in English language or Finnish that were able to answer the research question and that do not concentrate on expatriation were included in this literature review if full texts of the articles were accessed. Altogether 21 articles were included. Inductive content analysis was applied to analyze the data.    Three generic categories including three to five subcategories were formed. The categories are: (1) Organizational support: Managerial support, Emotional support, Social support, Additional support and Provision of formal networks; (2) Provision of education: Education and training, Language support, Orientation programs and Time; and (3) Nature of working environment: Working conditions, Favorable working environment and Fairness and Equality.    Promotion of wellbeing of culturally diverse nursing staff requires many interventions and a lot of efforts.   A holistic approach is important, as can be seen from various perspectives appearing in the categories that were identified. The most important thing seems to be consideration of the needs of newly arrived nurses and interest in their supporting. They need not only educational and practical, but also emotional and peer support in an envi-ronment where equality and fairness can take place. .

This book focuses on how EU welfare policies are implemented at the local level in 11 European cities and how local policy making addresses womenś care responsibilities. The book studies the complex combination of and the relationships between local political processes, policies, institutions, structural conditions and outputs, as well as outcomes for the womenś labour market integration. It demonstrates how cultural settings and multi-level governance patterns form the "playground" for local policy makers to formulate their welfare policies concerning service provision. The book further demonstrates how local production systems and the situation of the local labour market influence the prospects that women have in working and caring. EU welfare policy promotes the labour market integration of women as well as gender equality. The provision of adequate care services is vital in supporting womenś employment. Within comparative welfare research, the focus has been on the national welfare systems and policies even if care services are overwhelmingly provided by local authorities that in many EU member states enjoy considerable autonomy. This book fills the gap in understanding local welfare policy making from a comparative perspective.
Health in all policies : prospects and potentials
This thesis is made as a case study for an Oulu based indoor activity park. The case company also organizes work welfare activity services for business customers. The objective of this thesis is to determine what kind of work well-being activities companies in Oulu region organizes. Another objective is to find out what are the key issues the case company needs to pay attention to in order to be able to provide attractive services for companies. It was also wanted to examine companies expectations towards the benefits that can be achieved by organizing work welfare activity days. Work welfare is the competitive tool which creates financial performance. Work well-being must be considered from the perspective of profitability of the business so that its effects can be utilized in the best possible way. In this thesis the work welfares impacts on competitiveness were examined through three main players: productivity and cost-efficiency, quality of work and customer satisfaction, and intangible assets. .Another part of the theory consist of the factors affecting work well-being from the individual and organizational point of view. There has been used Rauramos five steps of work well-being- model examines the basic needs with respect of work. The research method used in this thesis is quantitative semi-structured research. It was conducted as a questionnaire which was sent to the respondents via e-mail. Smaller companies had bigger budgets and they organize more often work welfare activity days which last one day. The companies were interested in organizing work welfare activity days in the future as well as having new experiences. Comfortable environment was found out to be the most important factor when choosing a place where to organize work welfare days. The importance of evening program and wide range of options emerged. Companies believed that work welfare has an impact on the companys success. Relaxation, elevating team spirit and work motivation were found to be the key objectives. The company should focus on smaller companies since they have bigger budgets. Investing in websites is important since companies find information online. The work well-being activity days should have a variety of options to choose from since it occurred many times in the study. The opportunity for evening program was found to be important. The activities uplifting team spirit are worth investing in since it occurred many times in the study.
Simply putting wellness programs in place does not guarantee employee participation. Putnam shows how to design wellness programs that are effective and stimulate voluntary compliance. She provides examples, resources, and action items for a variety of programs, and helps you identify what will work in your situation.

The mobile phone business is in transformation and so is Nokia as well. It means that rapid changes are needed almost constantly and it is affecting the employees more or less dramatically. Organizations are forced to change and more efficiency is wanted. These rapid changes need good management and strong personalities in charge who are able to coach the employees through the changes and without jeopardizing the performance too much. The purpose of this Thesis was to study the operational mode of the Nokia Salo Hardware organization before and after the big organizational change which took place in 2009. The research made before the organizational change gave a good background for the further research after the organizational change. The purpose was to study how the organizational change affected the job profiles of the employees, responsibilities, the working methods, the co-operation between different teams and information sharing. This Thesis was qualitative in nature and was conducted in close co-operation with the Salo Hardware organization. The research methods were interviews, group interviews, meetings, discussions and the literature overview. The research strategies used in the study were the survey research and case study research strategies. As results, there were some deficiencies found in the operation of the Salo Hardware organization. There were improvements needed at least in the information sharing, in the job profiles of the Project Managers, in the project organization structures and in the change management. Based on the results of this Thesis, new information sharing meetings were started and the job profiles of the project managers were made clearer along with the unified project organizations in Salo. The changes made based on this Thesis brought some more unity to the Salo Hardware organization and clarity after the dramatic organizational change.

"As the pace of change in organizations increases, leaders and HR personnel must support their employees, show understanding as to why employees might react in a certain way, what they need from their working relationships, and how staff might be better motivated. Neuroscience can offer insights into all these issues. Neuroscience for Organizational Change shows how to take the findings from neuroscience and put them into action by looking at the importance of communicating change effectively through storytelling, explaining how better understanding of the brain enables better planning of organizational change, managing emotions, and creating a feeling of social connection that employees can draw on for support during times of change. Each chapter includes illustrations, solutions and examples of what other companies have done, and questions/checklist at the end"--
