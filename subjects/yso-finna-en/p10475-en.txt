A selection of the newest materials and best fabrication techniques for esthetic restorative results are elegantly presented in QDT 2016. Original articles on minimally invasive procedures, CAD/CAM, difficult cases, and the ever-challenging transition zone take center stage this year. The State of the Art article features full-mouth esthetic rehabilitation of the severely worn and compromised dentition, and the Biomaterials Update focuses on self-etching primer as an alternative to strong hydrofluoric and porcelain etching. Rounding out the issue is a special feature on achieving excellence in portrait photography, courtesy of Naoki Aiba.

The retention of a complete denture and the patient’s adaptation varies considerably among different individuals. Resorption of the edentulous alveolar ridge differs greatly and some patients need implant-retained overdentures to enable adequate retention of their prostheses. In some extreme cases it is necessary to increase the volume of the alveolar ridge with bone grafts. The aim of this study was to examine the outcome of implant-supported overdenture treatment conducted in Oulu University Hospital. The aim was also to assess the impact of treatment on oral health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction.The study group was comprised of patients treated with a mandibular or maxillary implant overdenture and a group of patients with extreme mandibular bone resorption treated with extraoral bone grafts and implants. The treatments were performed in 1985–2013 thus also providing long-term results.The results of this study showed predictable and successful treatment outcomes also among elderly patients and in severe situations with bone deficiency. The most frequent complication in the clinical follow-up was loosening of the retention mechanism, commonly noted in other previous studies. Despite some minor mechanical defects in prosthetic structures or mild mucosal inflammation around the implants, they did not hinder everyday use of the prostheses. Neither the number of supporting implants nor the connection type seemed to have a great impact on patient satisfaction. Older patients with a mandibular overdenture seemed to be most satisfied. In conclusion, treatment with implant overdentures seems to be successful also in the long-term.

Outcome of implant-supported overdenture treatment
Metal ceramic restorations have been used in fixed prosthodontics since the 1950s, but the lack of aesthetics, the inclination to use metal-free materials, possible allergic reactions to metals, and the high cost of high noble alloys have increased the use of all-ceramic materials. The ongoing development of ceramic materials led to the introduction of zirconia to fixed prosthodontics over a decade ago. The mechanical properties of zirconia have proven to be excellent, but the clinical outcome of conventional fixed zirconia restorations over the long term is unclear. This retrospective clinical study evaluated two- to seven-year outcomes, early complications during prosthetic treatment and short-term failures during the first year of use of zirconia single crowns and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). The usefulness and durability of zirconia single crowns in abutment teeth of partial removable dental prostheses (RDPs) was also evaluated.The material consisted of 173 patients treated with zirconia single crowns or FDPs by undergraduate dental students between 2007 and 2010. Of these patients 94 were women and 79 men (mean age 55 years, range 18–79 years). Altogether 268 zirconia single crowns (mean 3 crowns, range 1–12 crowns per patient) had been fabricated for 88 patients and 120 zirconia FDPs (range 3–12 units, mean 4.5 units) for 102 patients. Seventeen patients had received both crown(s) and FDP(s).The results show that zirconia single crowns and FDPs are a suitable treatment alternative in fixed prosthodontics. Early complications during prosthetic treatment and short-term failures during the first year of use were few. The survival rate of the zirconia single crowns after 3.9 years (2–6 years) was 89% and the success rate was 80%. The survival rate of zirconia FDPs after 4.9 years (3–7 years) was 100% and the success rate was 89%. Zirconia single crowns perform well as abutment teeth of partial RDPs with a metal framework, but fractures in the veneering porcelain remain a problem.
