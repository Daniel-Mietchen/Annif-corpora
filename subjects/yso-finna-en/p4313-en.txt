During the last ten years, the two rare spider species Micaria lenzi Bösenberg, 1899 (Gnaphosidae) and Clubiona juvenis Simon, 1878 (Clubionidae) have been found on coastal sand dunes and inland dunes near the coast in Finland. The findings are the northernmost ones in Europe, extending the known range of M. lenzi from southernmost Sweden northwards by almost 1000 kilometers.
