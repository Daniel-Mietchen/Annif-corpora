The main goal of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment is a healthy mother and a healthy child. The most important complication following IVF/ICSI arises from the increased risk of multiple pregnancies. An elective single embryo transfer (eSET) with the freezing of spare embryos and subsequent treatment with frozen embryo transfer (FET) is the only way to avoid this complication. For this reason, the number of children born after FET is steadily rising.The aim of this study was to provide more detailed evidence on the safety of FET, particularly focusing on serum hormone profiles during the first trimester weeks of singleton pregnancies after IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET), after FET during a natural menstrual cycle, and after spontaneous conception. Another part of this study compared the perinatal outcomes, congenital anomalies (CAs), and morbidity of singletons born after FET and IVF/ICSI fresh ET. The reference group was those born after spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies.In the clinical prospective study, the maternal serum estradiol and progesterone levels in pregnancies after fresh ET (n=39) were higher during early pregnancy weeks than in FET (n=30) and SC pregnancies (n=41), while the hormonal profiles after FET did not differ from SC pregnancies. In the large register study, FET children (n=1830) were found to have a reduced risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, a low birthweight, and being small for their gestational age compared with children born after fresh ET (n=2942). However, FET children have an increased risk for being large for their gestational age. The major CAs and morbidity until three years of age did not differ between groups. When compared with SC children (n =31 243), the perinatal outcome was worse and the rates of CAs and morbidity were higher in FET children.The FET cycle seemed to provide a better physiological environment for early fetal development than fresh ET. Further, FET protects against some of the adverse perinatal outcomes of children when compared with fresh ET, but not when it comes to the major CAs and early somatic health.This study provides further evidence of the safety of FET in comparison with fresh ET. This information should further encourage clinicians to implement eSET combined with cryopreservation in their IVF/ICSI program.
