The National Gallery houses one of the most important collections of early Italian paintings outside Italy, including works by Cimabue, Duccio, Giotto and the di Cione brothers. Since these were last catalogued there have been four new acquisitions, while reexamination of the collection has revealed, through infrared reflectography, the significance of underdrawings in early Italian paintings, together with other new information about technique. In reviewing and in some cases reattributing the works catalogued here, the author takes account of the substantial body of new research published over the last twenty years.
