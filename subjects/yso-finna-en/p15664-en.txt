Facing diversity : the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland from 2004 to 2007
Existing congregations and denominations are so addicted to self-destructive practices that they cannot change until they admit their bondage. These practices include a hunt for doctrinal purity on the theological right, and a desire for political justice on the theological left. The answer is a complete systemic transformation of congregation or denomination, and consultant Tom Bandy offers twenty shocking truths that thriving churches have discovered. Tom Bandy helps addicted churches kick their habits with the deconstruction of the existing system, followed by an emphasis on small group ministry, multi-track worship experiences, the retraining of enabling pastors, and an abiding, relentless sensitivity toward people who are seeking a Higher Power but who have lost patience with conflicted, self-absorbed religious institutions. He argues in the final chapter, on a theology of the thriving church, that the gospel offers the culture "welcome relief," and not "good news.".
