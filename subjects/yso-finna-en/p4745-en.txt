How to count : an introduction to combinatorics
The substantial development effort of this text, involving multiple editions and trailing in the context of various workshops, university courses and seminar series, clearly shows through in this new edition with its clear writing, good organisation, comprehensive coverage of essential theory, and well-chosen applications. The proofs of important results and the representation of key algorithms in a Pascal-like notation allow this book to be used in a high-level undergraduate or low-level graduate course on graph theory, combinatorial optimization or computer science algorithms. The well-worked solutions to exercises are a real bonus for self study by students.

"Mathematicians have found it useful to enumerate all sorts of things arising in discrete mathematics: elements of finite groups, configurations of ones and zeros, graphs of various sorts; the list is endless. Analytic combinatorics uses analytic techniques to do the counting: generating functions are defined and their coefficients are then estimated via complex contour integrals. This book is the result of nearly fifteen years work on developing analytic machinery to recover, as effectively as possible, asymptotics of the coefficients of a multivariate generating function. It is the first book to describe many of the results and techniques necessary to estimate coefficients of generating functions in more than one variable"--

"This easy-to-read book demonstrates how a simple geometric idea reveals fascinating connections and results in number theory, the mathematics of polyhedra, combinatorial geometry, and group theory. Using a systematic paper-folding procedure it is possible to construct a regular polygon with any number of sides as well as three-dimensional models known as polyhedra. This remarkable algorithm has led to interesting proofs of certain results in number theory, has been used to answer combinatorial questions involving partitions of space, and has enabled the authors to obtain the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron in around three steps, using nothing more complicated than basic arithmetic and the most elementary plane geometry. All of these ideas, and more, reveal the beauty of mathematics and the interconnectedness of its various branches"--

Summary: This books gives an introduction to discrete mathematics for beginning undergraduates. One of original features of this book is that it begins with a presentation of the rules of logic as used in mathematics. Many examples of formal and informal proofs are given. With this logical framework firmly in place, the book describes the major axioms of set theory and introduces the natural numbers. The rest of the book is more standard. It deals with functions and relations, directed and undirected graphs, and an introduction to combinatorics. There is a section on public key cryptography and RSA, with complete proofs of Fermat's little theorem and the correctness of the RSA scheme, as well as explicit algorithms to perform modular arithmetic. The last chapter provides more graph theory. Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles are discussed. Then, we study flows and tensions and state and prove the max flow min-cut theorem. We also discuss matchings, covering, bipartite graphs.

Introductory Combinatorics emphasizes combinatorial ideas, including the pigeon-hole principle, counting techniques, permutations and combinations, Polya counting, binomial coefficients, inclusion-exclusion principle, generating functions and recurrence relations, and combinatortial structures (matchings, designs, graphs). Written to be entertaining and readable, this book's lively style reflects the author's joy for teaching the subject. It presents an excellent treatment of Polya's Counting Theorem that doesn't assume the student is familiar with group theory. It also includes problems that offer good practice of the principles it presents. The third edition of Introductory Combinatorics has been updated to include new material on partially ordered sets, Dilworth's Theorem, partitions of integers and generating functions. In addition, the chapters on graph theory have been completely revised. A valuable book for any reader interested in learning more about combinatorics.

"Internationally recognised researchers look at developing trends in combinatorics with applications in the study of words and in symbolic dynamics. They explain the important concepts, providing a clear exposition of some recent results, and emphasise the emerging connections between these different fields. Topics include combinatorics on words, pattern avoidance, graph theory, tilings and theory of computation, multidimensional subshifts, discrete dynamical systems, ergodic theory, numeration systems, dynamical arithmetics, automata theory and synchronised words, analytic combinatorics, continued fractions and probabilistic models. Each topic is presented in a way that links it to the main themes, but then they are also extended to repetitions in words, similarity relations, cellular automata, friezes and Dynkin diagrams. The book will appeal to graduate students, research mathematicians and computer scientists working in combinatorics, theory of computation, number theory, symbolic dynamics, tilings and stringology. It will also interest biologists using text algorithms"--

The concept of Wiener chaos generalizes to an infinite-dimensional setting the properties of orthogonal polynomials associated with probability distributions on the real line. It plays a crucial role in modern probability theory, with applications ranging from Malliavin calculus to stochastic differential equations and from probabilistic approximations to mathematical finance. This book is concerned with combinatorial structures arising from the study of chaotic random variables related to infinitely divisible random measures. The combinatorial structures involved are those of partitions of finite sets, over which Mobius functions and related inversion formulae are defined. This combinatorial standpoint (which is originally due to Rota and Wallstrom) provides an ideal framework for diagrams, which are graphical devices used to compute moments and cumulants of random variables. Several applications are described, in particular, recent limit theorems for chaotic random variables. An Appendix presents a computer implementation in MATHEMATICA for many of the formulae.
