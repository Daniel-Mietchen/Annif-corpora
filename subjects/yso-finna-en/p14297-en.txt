The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of pressurized hot water extracted hemicellulose fractions from various wood species as feeds for ruminants. In Experiment 1, the fermentability of several hemicellulose extracts was screened using an in vitro gas production method. The samples were extracted from spruce (Picea abies) including mainly galactoglucomannan (GGM), from birch (Betula pendula) consisting mainly of xylan and from larch (Larix sibirica) consisting mainly of arabinogalactan. The GGM and xylan samples were readily fermented by rumen microbes while arabinogalactan was not. Based on the in vitro study, GGM was chosen for an in vivo digestibility trial using sheep, where it was fed at increasing proportions of diet dry matter (0, 47, 94 and 141 g kg-1) in a Latin Square design. The in vivo organic matter digestibility of GGM was relatively low, 0.58, but PHWE extracted hemicellulose has some potential as a feed for ruminants.

Abstract: The microclimates of the Kevo IBP (International Biological Programme) ecosystem study sites are discussed. Comparisons between the sites and the meteorological station are made by means of word models and regression and correlation analyses. Several ecologically meaningsful climatological data are given as monthly and other averages. General descriptions of the study sites are also given.

Abstract: In 1965-1966 the caterpillars of the geometrid Oporinia autumnata defoliated vast areas of birch forests in Finnish Lapland. The damage areas in Utsjoki, the northernmost district of Finland, were studied more thoroughly. About 1350 km² were defoliated and large areas of this will be changed into treeless "tundra"...
Abstract: The abundance of gastropods, centipedes, harvestmen, spiders, and insects in the ground layer of pine forest, birch forest, and subalpine heath was investigated by pitfall trapping and sifting at Kevo (69° 45̕ N., 27° E.), Finnish Lapland, in the summer of 1969.
