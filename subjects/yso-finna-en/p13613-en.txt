Skin is the largest organ in our body protecting us from ultraviolet radiation and xenobiotics. UV-radiation is a common cause of squamocellular carcinoma and melanoma of the skin that cause morbidity and mortality world wide. Reactive oxygen species are constantly formed by, for example, cellular respiration and UV-radiation, and they can readily react with virtually any macromolecule within cell structures causing damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. Oxidative stress (OS) is a homeostatic process that is dysregulated in cancer cells to their benefit. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the main regulator of antioxidant response and it has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers enabling their survival and growth. By using immunohistochemistry we studied the change and prognostic significance of OS markers in melanoma from paraffin embedded patient samples. Nrf2 expression is increased in melanoma, associating with deeper invasion and a worse melanoma-specific outcome. In addition, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers Slug, Twist and Zeb1 showed altered expression levels in relation to invasion and metastasis associating also with Nrf2. With the help of target inhibition molecules Vemurafenib and MEK-inhibitor CI-1040, In vitro study showed that BRAF- and NRAS-mutations might activate Nrf2. Furthermore, Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin I showed decreased expression in malignant melanomas and metastases compared to benign naevi. Intriguing findings were made from the surrounding structures of melanomas e.g. loss of expression of an oxidative lesion marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in adjacent endothelial cells associated with worse melanoma-specific survival. Changes in the expression of adhesion molecules claudins 1-5 and 7 were studied in the progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and preneoplastic lesions.Change in claudin composition can alter epidermal permeability and cell polarity.Efficiency of oncological treatment modalities is frequently based on oxidative stress damage. Nrf2-inhibition could offer the means to increase the sensitivity of cancerous tissue to oxidative insults and hinder proliferative and survival signalling. Later research should focus on the relation of Nrf2 with other signalling and observations made from the tumour microenvironment.
