Verbal periphrasis in Ancient Greek : have- and be- constructions
Ancient Greek is commonly considered a 'synthetic' or 'inflectional' language, that is, a language with a high morpheme-per-word ratio. Nevertheless, already at the earliest stages of the language one finds traces of multi-word 'periphrastic' constructions similar to those in the modern European languages, as in ήν γινόμενα, 'it was happening', or έχει μαθών, 'he has learned'. Verbal Periphrasis in Ancient Greek offers a systematic investigation of periphrastic constructions with the verbs 'to be' and 'to have' based on an extensive corpus of texts, ranging from the eighth century BC to the eighth century AD. It clarifies the notions of 'verbal periphrasis' and 'adjectival periphrasis' from a theoretical point of view, and offers a broad introduction to a selection of recent advancements in linguistics. It includes a diachronic analysis which investigates constructions in all three main aspectual domains-perfect aspect, imperfective aspect, and perfective aspect-combining a qualitative with a quantitative approach. In doing so, the volume presents a substantial contribution to our understanding of the ancient Greek verbal system and its development over time.

Ancient Greek verb-initial compounds : their diachronic development within the Greek compound system
This book offers a comprehensive investigative study of the argument realisation of the concepts of causative purpose, permit, let/allow and transfer in a broad cross-linguistic typologically diverse mix of languages with GIVE, GET, TAKE, PUT, and LET verbs. This volume stands as the first systematic exploration of these verbs and concepts as they occur in complex events and clauses. This book brings together scholars and researchers from a variety of functionally inspired theoretical backgrounds that have worked on these verbs within one language or from a cross-linguistic perspective. The objective is to understand the linguistic behaviour of the verbs and their inter-relationships within a contemporary cognitive-functional linguistic perspective. The languages represented include Irish, German, Slavic (West Slavic: Polish, Czech, Slovak and Sorbian and Western South Slavic: Slovenian and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian), Germanic, Romance, Gan Chinese Yichun dialect, Maori, Bohairic Coptic, Shaowu Chinese, Hebrew, English, Lithuanian, Estonian, the Australian dialects Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara, Italian, and Persian. Topics discussed include argument structure and the encoding of arguments under causation, permission and transferverbs, their lexical semantics and event structure.

This investigation makes a significant contribution to scholarship in that it helps translators to more accurately understand, interpret, and translate the scriptures in the light of information provided in this manuscript. This will be invaluable to Bible scholars, translators, linguists and any serious student of the Scriptures. This study explores a peculiar Semitic syntactical construction known as verbal coordination in Hebrew as defined by Gesenius, whereby two verbs joined in a tight construction function as a grammatical unit, the first verb modifying the second as to the manner of its action. Evidence presented from the Hebrew Scriptures through the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Targumim to the Old Syriac Gospels shows this structure also occurs in Aramaic. Grammaticizing offers a rationale for this usage, compensating in part for the scarcity of natural adverbs in the Semitic languages. It is demonstrated that this construction underlies certain clumsy expressions in the Greek text of the Gospels, which offers a different perspective for understanding, interpretation, and translating the text with particular application to the life and teachings of Jesus. A representative number of verses considered from the Gospels illustrate the principles and implications of the thesis. This work will appeal, not only to Biblical scholars and translators, but also to any serious student of the Scriptures and to linguists in general.

"Although for some scholars the very possibility of syntactic reconstruction remains dubious, numerous studies have appeared reconstructing a variety of basic elements of Proto-Indo-European syntax based on evidence available particularly from ancient and/or archaic Indo-European languages. The papers in this volume originate from the Workshop "PIE Syntax and its Development" (Thessaloniki 2011), which aimed to bring together scholars interested in these problems and to shine new light on current research into ancient Indo-European syntax. Special attention was paid to the development of the hypothetical reconstructed features within the documented history of Indo-European languages. The articles in this volume were originally published in the Journal of Historical Linguistics Vol. 3:1 (2013)." --
