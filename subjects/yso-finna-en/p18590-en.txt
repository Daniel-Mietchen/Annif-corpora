Mathematica(R): A Problem-Centered Approach introduces the vast array of features and powerful mathematical functions of Mathematica using a multitude of clearly presented examples and worked- out problems. Each section starts with a description of a new topic and some basic examples. The author then demonstrates the use of new commands through three categories of problems - the first category highlights those essential parts of the text that demonstrate the use of new commands in Mathematica whilst solving each problem presented; - the second comprises problems that further demonstrate the use of commands previously introduced to tackle different situations; and - the third presents more challenging problems for further study. The intention is to enable the reader to learn from the codes, thus avoiding long and exhausting explanations. While based on a computer algebra course taught to undergraduate students of mathematics, science, engineering and finance, the book also includes chapters on calculus and solving equations, and graphics, thus covering all the basic topics in Mathematica.
The Mathematica graphics guidebook
This book solves mathematical analysis problems using popular software packages. Besides fundamental theoretical notions, the book offers many exercises solved both mathematically and by computer, using Matlab 7.9, Mathcad 14, Mathematica 8 or Maple 15.

"Mathematica, developed and maintained by Wolfram Research, is a trusted and popular tool used to analyze and visualize data. This book begins by introducing you to the Mathematica environment and the basics of dataset loading and cleaning. You will then learn about the different kinds of widely used datasets so that you are comfortable with the later chapters. Then, in the subsequent chapters, you will learn about time series, scientific, statistical, information, and map visualizations. Each topic is demonstrated by walking you through an example project. Along the way, the dynamic interactivity and graphics packages are also introduced. Finally, the book ends with a brief discussion of color maps and aesthetics issues. Using this book, you will learn how to build visualizations from scratch, quickly and efficiently."--Cover.
