The background of this research is the public perception of complementary and alternative therapies. There is an abundance of procedures and techniques that focus on the restoration and maintenance of one's health and wellbeing. This phenomenon has led to the production of a lot of information that must be evaluated by the general public. The main purpose of the research was to answer the following questions: 1) Where do people find out about complementary and alternative therapies? 2) What is their motivation to know more? 3) What is the level of interest and reaction to these therapies? The theoretical framework was based on literature covering an analysis of complementary and alternative therapies, the history of medicine and an analysis of information sources regarding these therapies, as well as medical and scientific public databases. The report was conducted through my own reading and research on the internet regarding complementary and alternative medicine. The main method used was quantitative research involving a questionnaire in; this was to ascertain the public perception of and level of interest in this field. The findings show that public perception towards alternative and complementary medicine is generally positive and there that is a growing interest in this field, due to both health reasons and the search for spiritual fulfilment. However, the public is for the most part poorly informed, as the sources of information often bring up for many questions of validity and reliability. Furthermore, public perception may suffer due to the fact that these therapies are often marketed as common healthcare products or services, through which they can lose some of their authenticity. The report helps the reader understand the overall position of complementary and alternative therapies in the broader context of contemporary medicine, as well as how this specific information is conveyed to the public.
