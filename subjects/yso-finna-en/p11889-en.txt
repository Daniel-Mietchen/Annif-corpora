This practical clinical handbook reveals that sickle cell disease (SCD) is an increasingly common condition to manage in Europe and North America. SCD demands clinical expertise and experience as well as sensitivity to its social and cultural context. This book is designed to broaden readersℓ́ℓ knowledge in this challenging condition by describing the acute and long-term complications unique to SCD and that affect nearly every system of the body. Critically, it also details the significant recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of SCD that are leading to novel treatment modalities. ℗ℓ Sickle Cell Disease in Clinical Practice promotes higher quality care by outlining the clinical problems as they arise, and covering essential background information, including up-to-date research, and useful points to guide management. As such, the intended target audience is broad and includes general physicians, general practitioners, hematologists, pediatricians, emergency medicine physicians, surgeons, medical students, nurse specialists and commissioners.

Summary.
Pocket Reference to Renal Anemia, Second edition, provides a comprehensive overview of anemia in patients with renal disease, including the definition and causes of renal anemia, current management approaches, and the latest clinical practice guidelines. Key learning points are highlighted throughout the book and also listed at the end of the book for a quick reference. The book is useful for general physicians, fellows, and other healthcare professionals wishing to learn more about renal anemia.

This volume provides a modern look on the age-old influenza infection and the preventive role of anti-influenza shots. Influenza pandemic outbreaks are unrelenting despite the growing understanding of the molecular basis of viral infection and its spreads. A leap in medical technologies has revolutionized the design of new influenza vaccines. The chapters cover vaccination strategies in various age-groups of people and provide the extensive amount of knowledge on the immune response to influenza vaccination in a spectrum of disease conditions.
