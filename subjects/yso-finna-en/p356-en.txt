The initial idea, which stands at the background for making this thesis was to create a new bar concept in the centre of Helsinki. However, to generate a successful concept, it became more meaningful to study the current market situation of bars in central Helsinki - to learn from different bar concepts and types. Hence, the focus of the thesis is on the overall marketing management of bars in Helsinki city centre, thus involving the topics and interest on: segmentation, target marketing, marketing strategies, differentiation and issues on competition, not forgetting the trends of the bar business in the local business environment and beyond.   Furthermore, previous studies regarding restaurant segmentation, (consumer choice) attributes and dining out occasions, are used for guidance as far as the attributes and occasions for visiting bars are concerned. Therefore, the aim of the study is  to get to know the current situation of bars in the heart of Helsinki, in terms of various concepts, competitive differentiation; and to define (consumer choice) attributes and occasions for visiting bars, from the managers` point of view.  The data of the thesis is derived from bar managers of the few bars selected by their different concepts. Since interviewing customers has been left out from the research, the most appropriate research methodology in this case was found to be the qualitative method, involving personal interviews. The research procedure includes a framework, illustrating all of the key points of the thesis - they are sorted and analysed within the framework methodology structure. In addition to the primary research using qualitative methodology; secondary research selecting appropriate and fit literature, can be seen also as part of the methodology or at least as part of the learning process.   To conclude, while most of the bar managers are aware of their target group and practice various marketing strategies to retain their customers, most of the bar managers seem to have had an innovative idea which they went to fulfil, without conducting primary marketing research. Furthermore, customers are attracted by using informal networks like communication and socialization within the target customer group. Still, some inexpensive marketing efforts, such as distributing flyers or using customers surveys are practiced by bar managers too. All in all, the bar managers seem to be aware of competition and the importance of various bar attributes like image, atmosphere, location, music, service quality, personnel, etc. Following each and every one of the stated objectives,  problems and aim of the thesis to find answers; solutions and examples are portrayed to present findings from the data, in discovering the bar management and market  environment of bars in Helsinki city centre by addressing the particular issues, themes and topics on focus.
