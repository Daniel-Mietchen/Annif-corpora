osteopaths
"This clinically oriented textbook provides a patient-focused approach to the diagnosis and treatment of somatic dysfunction--functional impairment of the musculoskeletal system and related neural and vascular elements--in the context of family medicine practice. The book explains the clinical rationale for osteopathic manipulative treatment in specific situations and details procedures for treating common problems encountered in family medicine. Coverage begins with the philosophy and principles of osteopathic patient care. Two major sections focus on various patient populations and patients with various clinical conditions. A special section covers practice issues such as office set-up, progress notes, coding, and the standardized medical record."
