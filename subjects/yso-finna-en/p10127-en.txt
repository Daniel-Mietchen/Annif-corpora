The purpose of this thesis was to develop and intensify the design procedures in Paroc Oy Ab. The goal was to study different methods and harmonize ways of conducting design work. There was a great need for this because in addition to Paroc's own designers, the services of consulting designers from outside of the company were also used. Between companies there are major differences in using certain procedures and when designers are used from outside of the company the design work has to be harmonized so that manufacturing and maintenance would be more efficient. The emphasis in this thesis is on SolidWorks design and helpful tools such as the PDM that are used in the SolidWorks environment. The goal was to create standardized solutions for platforms, stairs, guard-rails, duct accessories and safety nets. The interpretation of technical standards has a great role in creating standardized parts. The possibilities of more efficient component use and the file archive system were studied to make the procedures as efficient as possible for the design work. Fast development of technical solutions and software to be considered when analyzing the results of this thesis as the conclusions may not be valid in the future.
