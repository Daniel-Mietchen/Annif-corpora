The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of pressurized hot water extracted hemicellulose fractions from various wood species as feeds for ruminants. In Experiment 1, the fermentability of several hemicellulose extracts was screened using an in vitro gas production method. The samples were extracted from spruce (Picea abies) including mainly galactoglucomannan (GGM), from birch (Betula pendula) consisting mainly of xylan and from larch (Larix sibirica) consisting mainly of arabinogalactan. The GGM and xylan samples were readily fermented by rumen microbes while arabinogalactan was not. Based on the in vitro study, GGM was chosen for an in vivo digestibility trial using sheep, where it was fed at increasing proportions of diet dry matter (0, 47, 94 and 141 g kg-1) in a Latin Square design. The in vivo organic matter digestibility of GGM was relatively low, 0.58, but PHWE extracted hemicellulose has some potential as a feed for ruminants.

Plastic log chute in steep terrain thinning operations (Republic of Korea)
Summary: The defoliation process of tamaracks (Larix laricina) during an outbreak of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) is described. The degree of defoliation correlated positively with the age, height and reproduction index of trees. The degree of defoliation did not correlate with the growth rate of tamaracks. On the basis of field observations alternative models to explain the age-specific resistance of trees to insect defoliators were developed and discussed.
