Choices in Deafness, since 1987 the preeminent guide to communication options, is now extensively revised and expanded to provide the complete scope of information parents of children with deafness or hearing loss need. From assessment and diagnosis to medical/audiological treatments, and from the latest types of cochlear implants and procedures to education and technology devices, this new edition presents a balance of research, guidance, and insight from experts and families.Seven new chapters plus an audio CD cover: -Universal Newborn Screening (implemented in 38 states, this required screening detects hearing loss much earlier, and has doubled the number of children found to have hearing loss) Auditory Neuropathy (a cause of hearing loss where the timing of sound is seriously disrupted, and which has only recently been understood) -Genetic Causes of Deafness (describes genetic testing and counseling in light of research that shows over 60% of deafness in children is due to genetic or hereditary causes) -The Transformation of Dreams (explores a shift in emotional outlook experienced by a parent/clinical psychologist upon learning her child is deaf) -Identifying a Program of Excellence (what to look for in an education program for your child in addition to the chosen communication option) -Communication Technology (services and devices that let deaf people communicate via phone, cell phone, Internet,video) -Making It in College (personal accounts of four students about how they communicate and socialize at college) -What Hearing Loss Sounds Like (a seven-minute audio CD depicts what speech sounds like as it simulates how hearing loss can affect pitch, loudness, and timing) As in the previous edition, Choices in Deafness presents five unbiased approaches to communication--Auditory-Verbal, ASL-English Bilingual, Cued Speech, Auditory-Oral, and Total Communication--and provides parents' first-person accounts of what it's like to use a specific method. Reading and resource lists round out this essential guide for parents.

The aim of this thesis was to assess and measure the level of customer satisfaction of Respecta's Assistive Devices (AD) rental service. Respecta is the market leader in the supply of assistive devices in Finland. The main target group for Respecta's rent assistive devices are the disabled and the elderly. The theoretical framework of the thesis focuses on customer satisfaction, service quality, customer loyalty and service marketing. The thesis presents customer satisfaction approaches and uses the gaps model of service quality as a key theory for the research. The contextual framework deals with assistive devices process and legislation. The empirical research was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The core study was carried out via a quantitative questionnaire which was sent to Respecta's customers. The questionnaire contained six questions regarding the level of satisfaction and three open-ended requests for comments. The total size of the sample was 172 and the response rate was 29%. The questionnaire was implemented by ZEF® online tool. The qualitative part of the study concerned benchmarking foreign assistive devices practices and suggesting importing possibilities to the Finnish market. Planning the research was done during spring and autumn 2010, and empirical research was implemented in spring 2011. The results of the questionnaire indicate that the current overall level of satisfaction among Respecta customers, while high, is not yet excellent. This highlights the importance of providing excellent service to customers, reenforced through clinics, especially to the service personnel in daily contact with the customers.

"Assistive technology for cognition is technology which can be used to enable, enhance or extend cognitive function. This book systematically examines how technologies can assist the cognitive function of people with brain impairment, with the potential to revolutionize rehabilitation. Technologies are reviewed which direct attention, remind, recognize, prompt and guide people through activities of daily living. Written by experts in neuropsychology and technology development, Assistive Technology for Cognition provides a comprehensive overview of the efficacy of technologies to assist people with brain impairments. Based on the framework provided by the International Classification of Function, each chapter covers a different cognitive function, namely, attention, memory, affect, perception, executive function, language, numeracy, sequencing and navigation, onto which existing and future assistive technologies for cognition are mapped. This structure provides in-depth research in an accessible way, and will allow practitioners to move from an assessment of cognitive deficits to the prescription of an appropriate assistive technology for cognition. The chapters also make suggestions for future developments.Assistive Technology for Cognition will be of great interest to clinicians and researchers working in brain injury rehabilitation, technology developers, and also to students in clinical psychology, neuropsychology and allied health disciplines"--
