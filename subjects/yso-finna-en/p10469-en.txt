Southwest African riddle-proverbs
Jacques Ellul--much less solemn in mood than usual--here cracks open political and sociological commonplaces, destructively and wittily demonstrating how our unthinking acceptance of them encourages hypocrisy, smugness, and mental inertia. Among the stereotypes of thought and speech thus exploded are such phrases as You can't act without getting your hands dirty, Work is freedom, We must follow the current of history, and Women find their freedom (dignity) in work. A certain number of these old saws preside over our daily life. They permit us to understand one another and to swim in the ordinary current of society. They are accepted as so certain that we almost never question them. They serve at once as sufficient explanations for everything and as clinchers in too many arguments. Ellul explores the ways in which such clichs mislead us and prevent us from having independent thoughts--and in fact keep us from facing the problems to which they are theoretically addressed. They are the new commonplaces. Just as the nineteenth century brought forth many such commonplaces (they are enshrined in Leon Bloy's Exgse and Flaubert's Dictionnaire des ides reues), so our century has been busy creating its own. What Ellul has done is to stand still long enough to look at them carefully, attack them with cool reason, and leave them nakedly exposed. In this document, Ellul's caustic fearlessness is at the service of truths that often are cruel, but always are lucid and impassioned. He represents the voice of intelligence, and while doing so is often hilarious and always therapeutic about matters of first importance.

"The thirteen chapters of this book comprise an intriguing and informative entry into the world of proverb scholarship, illustrating that proverbs have always been and continue to be wisdom's international currency. The first section of the book focuses on the field of paremiology (proverb studies) in general, the spread of Anglo-American proverbs in Europe, and the phenomenon of modern proverbs. The second section analyzes the use of proverbs in the world of politics, including a chapter on President Obama, while the third concentrates on the uses of proverbs in literature. The final section ends with detailed cultural studies of the origin, history, dissemination, use, function, and meaning of specific proverbs.Noted scholar Wolfgang Mieder shows that proverbs matter in culture, literature, and politics. Proverbs remain part and parcel of oral and written communication, and, he demonstrates, they deserve to be studied from a range of viewpoints. While various chapters deal with a variety of issues and approaches, they cohere through a rhetorical perspective that looks at the text, texture, and context of proverbs as speech acts that make a noteworthy impact on culture and society. Whether proverbs appear in everyday speech, on the radio, on television, in films, on the pages of newspapers or magazines, in advertisements, in literary works, or in political speeches, they serve as formulaic verbal devices to add authoritative weight through tradition, convention, and wisdom"--

There is no doubt that phraseology in general and paremiology in particular are experiencing a global boom that is especially pronounced in Europe, to wit the foundation of the European Society of Phraseology in 1999 with its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In North America, meanwhile, a certain revival of interest in phraseology and paremiology has also taken place. In order to make international scholars aware of the exciting paremiological work that has gone on in Canada and the United States during the past ten years, this new essay volume on (Anfang kursiv) Cognition, Comprehension, and Communication. A Decade of North American Proverb Studies (1990-2000) (Ende kursiv) is offered with the sincere hope that it will bring about further discussion and an increased interest in the intriguing world of proverbs.
