"A hopeful collection of essays about villages in Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and across the world. The "village" is an idea, a construct, and a way of organising society. Villages constitute the basic unit of analyses in the arts, humanities and the social sciences. For decades, village level studies have been conducted across a wide range of academic disciplines such as archaeology, real-estate management, architecture, computer science, medicine, pharmacy and pharmacology. Through the collection of essays presented, the contributors hope to generate interest in studying villages, to understand the meanings that attach themselves to the concept of the village, and to gain greater theoretical insights into multidisciplinary knowledge and analyses in today's highly developed global society"--

Noble savages : my life among two dangerous tribes - the Yanamamö and the anthropologists
Sickness, hygienic education and village practice : tuberculosis in the life of a cobbler
When Napoleon Chagnon arrived in Venezuela's Amazon region in 1964 to study the Yanomamø Indians, one of the last large tribal groups still living in isolation, he discovered a remarkably violent society. Men who killed others had the most wives and offspring, their violence possibly giving them an evolutionary advantage. The prime reasons for violence, Chagnon found, were to avenge deaths and abduct women. When Chagnon began publishing his observations, some cultural anthropologists who could not accept an evolutionary basis for human behavior refused to believe them. A scathing attack-which was quickly disproven-accused him of starting a measles epidemic among the Yanomamø, and the American Anthropological Association condemned him, only to rescind its condemnation after a vote by the membership. Thus Chagnon became perhaps the most famous American anthropologist since Margaret Mead-and the most controversial. In Noble Savages, Chagnon describes his seminal fieldwork-during which he lived among the Yanomamø, was threatened by tyrannical headmen, and experienced an uncomfortably close encounter with a jaguar-taking readers inside Yanomamø villages to glimpse the kind of life our distant ancestors may have lived thousands of years ago. And he forcefully indicts his discipline of cultural anthropology, accusing it of having traded its scientific mission for political activism.

Sidi Ameur : a Tunisian village
When Mahony returns to Mulderrig, a speck of a place on Ireland's west coast, he brings only his handsome face, a photograph of his too-young, long-lost mother, and a determination to do battle with the village's lies. Mahony also somehow wakes the dead from their graves, those folk who once lived here, with their foggy memories and hidden stories, floating greyly amongst the unseeing living. No one though - living or dead - will tell what happened to the teenage mother who abandoned him as a baby. Despite Mahony's certainty that more than one of them knows. Between Mulderrig's sly priest, an implacable nurse and a caustic elderly actress throwing herself into her final village play, this beautiful and blackly comic debut novel creates in crystal-clear, musical language an unforgettable world of strange kindnesses, bloody violence and buried secrets.

Questions like 'Trapped in folklore?' open up many possibilities for reflection and prompt different answers. This thematic publication with a rather provocative title discusses questions as to whether the selected musical phenomena are a fossilised form of tradition, folklore and folklorism and, as such, are trapped in a museum-like image isolated from contemporary cultural life, or whether we are looking at active events, changes, and adjustments within contemporary society.
