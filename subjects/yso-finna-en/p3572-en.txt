The project work for this thesis was commissioned by the Havi candle factory,  Riihimäki, and it is intended for testing a transportation technique for  the conveying of wick sustainers or wick tabs from a storage tank to the  production line of the tea light candle in the factory. The aim of the project work was to perform various tests on different  techniques or systems for the transportation of wick sustainers from a  storage unit or tank at the base of the work floor to the tea light candle  production line. The objective of this thesis was to present a layout structure  of the most efficient and economical method of transporting the wick  sustainers from the list of tested methods.  In this thesis, the Havi candle factory was introduced with emphasis on the  tea light candle production line. More insight was also paid to the needs  for a transport mechanism for the wick tabs to the production line of the  tea light candle. This was followed by a theoretical view of pressurized  gas systems. Furthermore, the various ideas for transporting the wick tabs  were tested and the most efficient method which was the use of pressurized  gas systems was further developed. The result obtained after various testing was performed shows that the direct  and overhead tank methods of transporting of the wick sustainers using  pneumatic technology (pressurized gas system) as the primary transportation  medium is a more efficient and economical way of transporting  the wick sustainers to the tea light candle production line.
