"In a twenty-first-century global economy, in which multinational companies coordinate and collaborate with partners and clientele around the world, it is usually English that is the parlance of business, research, technology, and finance. Most assume that if parties on both ends of the conference call are fluent English speakers, information will be shared seamlessly and without any misunderstanding. But is that really true? Words Matter examines how communications between transnational partners routinely break down, even when all parties are fluent English speakers. The end result is lost time, lost money, and often discord among those involved. What's going wrong? Contrary to a common assumption, language is never neutral. It is heavily influenced by one's culture and can often result in unintended meanings depending on word choice, a particular phrase, or even one's inflection. A recent study of corporate managers found that one out of five projects fail primarily because of ineffective transnational communication, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. In Words Matter, you will venture into the halls of multinational tech companies around the world to study language and culture at work; learn practical steps for harnessing research in communication and anthropology to become more skilled in the digital workplace; and learn to use the 'Communication Plus Model,' which can be easily applied in multiple situations, leading to better communication and better business outcomes"--Provided by publisher

Companies that operate globally aim at harmonising their business processes and related information systems in order to gain maximum efficiency. However, projects responsible for the process harmonisation and development work may face various practical difficulties as the project stakeholders represent several national cultures, languages and physical locations. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate these factors and find best practises on how to overcome the obstacles. The thesis is based on recent articles and the writer's own experiences in two large international companies whose names will not be mentioned. Also a few colleagues were interviewed with help of social media. The study refers to two large projects; one developed global project management processes and related information systems and the other designed sales order management processes and systems. The study consists of two main themes: cultural issues and virtual teams. Culture impacts, for example, individual project team member's beliefs, values, use of language and attitude to work. In addition, the physical distance, time zones and lack of face-to-face meetings make the project work challenging. The project team relies heavily on electronic communication tools that have their weaknesses. In the case projects special challenges were detected in requirement management, testing and end user training. From change management point of view it is important to involve end user organisations in the development work and implementation. Cultural issues and physical distance make the co-operation challeging. In addition, balancing between the global and local requirements is a difficult task.In order to make an international project succeed the project management and stakeholders should be aware of the possible challenges. The project should have clear processes in use and the stakeholders should have a possibility to get to know each other before the project starts. Face-to-face meeting should be organised regularly, but not too often as frequent travelling is hard. Strong support from the management is required. However, cultural issues should not be seen purely as challenges but also as a source of innovation and motivation.
Featuring a wide range of exercises, examples, and images, this textbook provides a practical way of analysing the discourses of the global media industries. Building on a comprehensive introduction to the history and theory of global media communication, specific case studies of lifestyle and entertainment media are explored with examples from films, global women's magazines, Vietnamese news reporting and computer war games. Finally this book investigates how global media communication is produced, looking at the formats, languages and images used in creating media materials, both globally and in localised forms. At a time when the media is becoming increasingly global, often with the same films, news and television programmes shown all over the world; "Global Media Discourse" provides an accessible, lively introduction into how globalisation is changing the language and communicative practices of the media. Integrating a range of approaches, including political economy, discourse analysis and ethnography, this book will be of particular interest to students of media and communication studies, applied linguistics, and (critical) discourse analysis.
