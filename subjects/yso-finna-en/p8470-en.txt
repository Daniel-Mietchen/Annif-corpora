This volume considers the timely issues of social and sustainable entrepreneurship. The chapters consider in depth the issues, problems, contexts, and processes that make entrepreneurial enterprises more social and/or sustainable. Top researchers from a diverse set of perspectives have contributed their latest research on a variety of topics such as the role of entrepreneurial bricolage in generating innovations in a social context (Gundry, Kickul, Griffins, and Bacq) and emerging themes in social entrepreneurship education (Thiru). Several chapters tackle lingering definitional issues such as the distinctions between social, sustainable, and environmental entrepreneurship (Dean, Sarason, and Neenan), or propose social entrepreneurship research agendas based on key research questions found in prior studies (Gras, Mosakowski, and Lumpkin). There are brief histories of social change and their entrepreneurial implications (Kucher and Summers), and frameworks for studying different types of social and sustainable entrepreneurship (Lichtenstein). Each of the chapters, in its own way, addresses the progress and promise of social and sustainable entrepreneurship as a future research domain of growing interest and importance.

BIM (Building Information Model) is an emerging notion appeared in recent years. Since then a large amount of BIM programs has been released. EcoDesigner is one of such programs, which is dealing with 3D-models. The research in question focuses on the study and analysis of this program. The paper presents a 3D-model of a building and its examination. The main principles of the calculation have been determined. The thesis shows and describes the calculations of the energy consumption of the building. The manual calculation of the heating losses is presented and described. All in all, the objectivity of the data is established and confirmed. Software of this type is crucial and useful nowadays and has a significant potential in the future. The software of BIM will be further developed in diverse directions. Its improvement will simplify the work process of engineers.

"An Introduction to Sustainability provides students with a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and ideas which are encompassed within the growing field of sustainability. The book teases out the diverse but intersecting domains of sustainability and emphasises strategies for action. Aimed at those studying the subject for the first time, it is unique in giving students from different disciplinary backgrounds a coherent framework and set of core principles for applying broad sustainability principles within their personal and professional lives. These include: working to improve equality within and across generations, moving from consumerism to quality of life goals and respecting diversity in both nature and culture. Areas of emerging importance such as the economics of happiness and wellbeing stand alongside core topics including: Energy and society, Consumption and consumerism, Risk and resilience, Waste, water and land. Key challenges and applications are explored through international case studies and each chapter includes a thematic essay drawing on diverse literature to provide an integrated introduction to fundamental issues. Launched with the brand-new Routledge Sustainability Hub, the book's companion website contains a range of features to engage students with the interdisciplinary nature of Sustainability. Together these resources provide a wealth of material for learning, teaching and researching the topic of sustainability. This textbook is an essential companion to any sustainability course"--

This book sets the questions of energy and the environment in the North in the global context and further addresses historical developments, views on energy taxation and tariffs, and effects of EU energy policy. Climate change appears more frequently than ever on the top of global and national policy agendas. In the current situation traditional environmental concern and environmental policy may not suffice in the face of the global challenge as manifested by climate change and the depletion of fossil energy resources. But as new data comes to light, new energy policies and changes in economic structures are crucial for putting into action global climate policy. Crucial tasks in environmental policy are the sustainable utilisation of natural resources and the conservation of natural and human-made habitats. One of the areas of the world where this comes into play the most is in the Nordic countries. Northern societies are predominantly high tech, high consumption and high energy supply societies. And with the transition from older energy sources (wood for heating and stream water for power production) to newer ones (oil and nuclear energy) discussions on the environmental impact have led to public and corporate action. The Northern countries have been at the forefront in finding sustainable alternatives to solve conflicts arising from the rise in energy needs. However, these countries have taken different pathways with different policies in attempting to achieve this. As the needs and concerns from climate change arise, a Northern dimension, involving policies that contrast to European and global trends, emerges. "Energy, Policy, and the Environment: Modeling Sustainable Development for the North" explores that dimension.

Abstract: The aim of my research is to look for means to reduce the ink and paper consumption in printing. Previously, all text documents or in this case specifically final year thesis papers' were printed without the awareness of the number of papers used and ink consumed. This thesis leans towards green technology based systems of printing which can be termed as  sustainable printing that can benefit the environment and the cost of production for that case. In the 21th century, global warming and climate changes have been the biggest issues addressed. The emission of a greenhouse gas during the production process of printing  pollutes our environment. Printing is the 3rd largest industry while pulp and paper is the 3rd largest industrial polluter of our environment. This study case explores the impact of printing on the environment and looks for means to reduce it. Ink and paper savings not only save us money but also our environment and native natural resources. Different  online tools such as InkSaver 2.0, ecoPrint2 Pro Ink and Paper Saver, and Ecofont have been analyzed. This research is based on the current thesis guidelines of media engineering students at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. I have attempted to modify the thesis  guidelines for saving ink and paper by applying techniques such as choosing the right inkeconomical typeface, a smaller font size, margin and line spacing. Finally, I have tested  the usability of the modified document. This research shows that the modification of typographic parameters and page layout of a document could save us paper and ink.
