Features the very best of Monty Python: a collection of favorite sketches, gags, words, and lyrics, chosen by the members of Monty Python who have picked some of their prized bits from across the whole range of Python books, scripts, and films. Included are such memorable moments as "The French Taunt King Arthur", "The Lumberjack Song", "What Have the Romans Ever Done for Us?", "The Court Martial of Sapper Walters", "Every Sperm is Sacred", "The Man Who Talks Entirely in Anagrams", and other priceless pieces of Python humor. Accompanying these words are some two hundred images that have become synonymous with Python through three decades.
