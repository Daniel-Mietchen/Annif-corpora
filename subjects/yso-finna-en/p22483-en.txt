Tourism is the main economic activity on the island of St Lucia, as well as the largest employer on the island. Despite this, the industry is yet to be fully embraced by the residents, and there is a certain level of resentment and skeptism towards the industry. In an effort to combat the negative attitudes towards the industry, the national tourism organizations, in conjunction with private tourism holdings, have embarked on a series of public sensitization programs aimed at garnering support for the industry.    The aim of this study is to examine the coverage and representation of the industry in the print media on the island. To do this, content analysis was carried out on 2 leading newspapers on the island, the St Lucia Star and the St Lucia Voice. The period of study was from September 2010 to February 2012 and a total of 49 tourism industry articles were used in the study.    Results indicate that the tourism industry received modest coverage in the local newspapers in terms of frequency of coverage. Results however indicate that though modest, the coverage was rather consistent throughout the months of the study. The majority of articles were positive in tone, with airlift and awards gained by the industry being the most popular topics discussed. Crime in the industry was the least popular topic.    An interesting discovery was the fact that most articles on the tourism industry were placed in the "hard news" sections of the newspapers as opposed to the travel and tourism section. Another interesting find was the photos which accompanied the articles. Most of the articles were accompanied by coloured photos which showed locals in business attire and very few of the photos showed traditional tourists or the natural attractions such as palm fringed beaches.    It is hoped that the findings of this research will allow industry professionals to know what information on the industry is already at the public's disposal, and in so doing, will help influence the design and implementation of future internal marketing and public sensitization programs.
