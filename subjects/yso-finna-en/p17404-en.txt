The disposal of municipal solid waste (MWS) is a  growing problem worldwide because of the increasing  volume of the waste and the negative impact on the  environment, health and safety. Among the combustion  and incineration technologies, fluidized  bed combustion is becoming more popular because of  its ability to handle a variety of waste and  advantages in controlling emission. However,in  the high moisture content wastes with low  calorific value, co-firing wastes with a  supplementary fuel such as coal is being tried in  many industrial and utility boilers. In order to  ensure that these co-firing facilities are properly  designed and operated, a fundamental understanding  of the co-combustion phenomena including its  dynamical characteristics must be established. It  is for this reason a basic study on the co-  combustion of MSW and lignite in a fluidized bed is  proposed. The objectives of this book are to  investigate the effect of main operating parameters  on combustion characteristics, to quantify the  fluctuating characteristics during steady-state  operation using statistical analysis and to create  a linear model obtained from input-output analysis. / Kustantajan esittely.
