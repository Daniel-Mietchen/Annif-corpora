The tumor microenvironment (TME) is critically important for tumor development. The microenvironment consists of fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), proteases and various other soluble factors produced by the cells. It is challenging to develop methods that appropriately mimic the human microenvironment, but this effort is essential in order to reliably elucidate the properties of potential anti-tumor drugs. The aim of this study was to create new 3D organotypic invasion models based on human tissue that would be used to study the effects of the anti-angiogenic molecules arresten and endostatin on tongue squamous carcinoma cells.The classic way to study cancer invasion has been to use a collagen invasion model that is created by mixing rat type I collagen, matrix produced by mouse EHS tumor cells and human fibroblasts. Our research group has developed a novel human myoma tissue based invasion model, which is composed of several different cell types and molecules that are normally present in the human TME. We show how this model is suitable for invasion studies, not only for oral cancer, but for other invasive cell lines as well.There are several matrix-derived fragments that have been shown to possess anti-angiogenic activity. Arresten is a 26 kDa fragment that is cleaved from type IV collagen and is known to inhibit angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries and tumor growth in vivo. However, its effect on the tumor microenvironment in addition to endothelial cells has not been studied. We show that arresten also directly affects oral cancer cells by decreasing their migration and invasion as well as tumor size, invasion and angiogenesis in in vivo mouse xenografts.Another inhibitor of angiogenesis, endostatin, is cleaved from type XVIII collagen. It has been shown to suppress angiogenesis and tumor growth without toxicity or side effects in mouse models. Our studies show that endostatin directly affects tongue squamous carcinoma cells by reducing their invasion and spreading in organotypic 3D assays and mouse tumor models.In summary, arresten and endostatin are anti-angiogenic as well as anti-invasive molecules and therefore potential cancer drugs. They seem to have a direct effect on carcinoma cells making the cells less invasive. The myoma model allows us to study the effects of anti-cancer molecules with a new prospective.

Progesterone target genes in breast cancer cells
Basement membranes (BM) underlie epithelia and endothelia and surround many tissues. In cutaneous BM epithelial cells are attached to the stroma via multiprotein complexes called hemidesmosomes (HD). Collagen XVII and integrin α6β4 are components of HD and they bind to laminin 332, a component of anchoring filaments, extracellularly. The main interest of this study is the function of collagen XVII and its interactions with these proteins. What is known about the function of collagen XVII is mostly derived from its role as an adhesive component in cutaneous HD. Here we demonstrate for the first time that collagen XVII is expressed by podocytes in the human and murine glomerulus and that mutant mice lacking collagen XVII in addition to small size, blisters and diffuse hair loss, also have deficient glomerular development and a high mortality rate. We also show for the first time at the protein level that collagen XVII is expressed, and probably has a functional interaction with laminin 332, in normal colon epithelia. We demonstrate that collagen XVII is expressed by the invasive cells of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) samples and its immunostaining is increased in metastasis in CRC. The higher proportion of collagen XVII positive tumor cells correlates with decreased disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival times and we also suggest a functional interaction between collagen XVII and laminin 332 in CRC. Previous studies have suggested that collagen XVII participates in keratinocyte migration by affecting the correlation of HD disassembly and assembly, its expression is increased in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and it may have a role in cell adhesion and migration in SCC carcinogenesis. Here we demonstrate upregulated collagen XVII, integrin β4 and laminin γ2 expression in actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease and SCC. The expression of collagen XVII was increasedwith a high degree of variation, especially in samples taken from areas where SCC is particularly invasive. We also demonstrate in the SCC-25 cell line that lack of collagen XVII or integrin β4 severely disrupts the adhesion, migration and invasivity of these cells. Taken together, in this study we show that collagen XVII is needed for normal glomerular development, is expressed in normal colon epithelia and participates in CRC and SCC carcinogenesis together with laminin 332 and integrin β4.
