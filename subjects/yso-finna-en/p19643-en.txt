This case discusses the paradigm shift and digital wisdom (i.e. the ability to use digital technology to complement existing abilities and decision making) that were manifested during a content analysis workshop given by the authors in the Middle East in the spring of 2015. Most of the participants were familiar with quantitative research, so the purpose of the workshop was to familiarize them with qualitative epistemology and the interpretivist philosophical stance. The workshop also let participants experience a paradigm transformation from manual analysis to computer-assisted analysis, in this case using the ATLAS.ti software.
