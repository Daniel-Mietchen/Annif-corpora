Exchange rate regimes and market interactions between onshore and offshore markets for Chinese Yuan
China's renminbi exchange rate has closely tracked the US dollar for over a decade.Although the peg has served the Chinese economy well, the recent depreciation of the US dollar and China's rapid economic development have increased discussion of other possible exchange regime options for China.In this paper, we contribute to the discussion by considering some of the options available to China in the light of recent theoretical and empirical work on exchange rates.Keywords: China, monetary policy, exchange rate regime .

This paper briefly examines the exchange rate arrangements of several of Eastern Europe's transition economies.Generally speaking, countries that have included some form of fixed exchange rate regime in their stabilization packages have been more successful in curbing inflation, and consequently reviving output. Further, while a fixed exchange rate is no panacea for economic problems, it can act as a credible nominal anchor in a comprehensive reform package.Such credibility, however, is contingent on the government's ability to implement a balanced budget. As transition progresses, fixed exchange rate regimes eventually become outmoded as they lack some of the flexibility and potency in conducting monetary policy central banks may require as the economy grows.To date, even the most advanced of the transition countries have balked at making this switch.A possible explanation may simply be inertia from past success of fixed exchange rates in reducing inflation and enhancing the credibility of such central banks. .

This article examines the theory of economic reform in light of the actual experience Poland.Its main themes are liberalisation and stabilisation.Liberalisation in the case of transition economies implies decontrol of domestic prices and foreign trade. Liberalization may be gradual (gradualism), or immediate (shock therapy).Here, we compare the effects of these strategies using Swedar van Wijnbergen's intertemporal speculation model, taking into account the question of currency convertibility.  According to monetarist theory, budget deficits are the main cause of inflation in closed economies.Thus, stabilisation programs usually start with budget balancing.Implementation of nominal anchors for economic reform is also an important issue, because nominal anchors can help eliminate demand pressure and build credibility.Three nominal anchors, i.e. wage tax, fixed exchange rate and high interest rate are closely examined.In addition, the non-trivial task of sequencing the phases of reform is discussed. Obviously, an unsuccessful stabilisation has a strong influence on, e.g. real exchange rates and export opportunities, so how does one time the phases of reform for successful results?  Poland's "Big Bang" reform is an example of a monetarist economic reform.This analysis covers the main features of the reform, applying the credit market model of Guillermo Calvo and Fabrizio Coricelli.Calvo and Coricelli have studied the influence of tight credit on output from their empirical results, which is of particular interest in discussion of the Polish case.The paper ends with a summary of the reform outcomes to date.  Keywords: Poland, liberalisation, stabilisation, credit market .

E-learning activities are likely to grow significantly and the area has potential to generate more possibilities for both teachers and students especially in higher education. It creates alternative ways to partake, tutor and utilize new learning environment. In this paper we present our on-going work on exploring current usage and attitudes towards using eLearning technologies in teaching. The aim was to investigate advantages, challenges and needs for support among teachers in higher education. In our case, focus was to concentrate on distance learning more than e-learning in general.  The results show that the perceived advantages of distance learning were dominated by independence concerning of time, place, flexibility and individual options. Distance learning was seen flexible and enhancing of students' freedom of their own studies. More surprisingly distance learning was perceived more activating than traditional learning increasing presence, participation and both communal and individual learning. In addition the results revealed that there is emerging need for building deeper understanding of challenges faced by teachers utilizing distance learning. It is important to take into account that continuous and relevant training, peer support for educators are key factors in order to increase usage of eLearning methods. It requires also more straightforward tools and services to support learning gains and enhance usage of distance learning in higher education.

Combining the incompatibles / fixed exchange rate,  liberalisation and financial development in Estonia
Modeling and forecasting implied volatility
Who's calling?
Contrary to most experience, Estonia (as well as Latvia and Lithuania) has been able to combine, for a number of years, fixed exchange rates, financial liberalisation (prior to proper supervision) and large current account deficits without inviting speculation using large capital flows as vehicles.The standard argument is that this must be due to exceptionally sound fundamentals and great policy credibility.Without challenging this argument either generally or for the case of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, this paper offers a supplementary perspective.These countries did not aim at developing a full-scale national economy with a full set of financial and other markets, as they had the possibility of joining an institutionally, culturally and geographically close set of North-Western European markets.Such a strategy goes further than having the goal of "rejoining Europe" as the external policy anchor.Having well-developed domestic markets can in some cases be substituted by accessing near-by markets, thus leaving little leeway to potentially unstable capital flows.This option, however, is not open to all, and it also has its downside. Key words: capital flows, exchange rate systems, institutional development, financial liberalisation, Baltic countries .

Essentials of online course design : a standards-based guide
China's foreign exchange system currently combines a virtual peg to the US dollar with direct capital account controls.With accession to the World Trade Organisation, China's capital control regime can be expected to lose its effectiveness in the face of accelerating liberalisation of trade and investment.While the country may experience in the medium term an increase in nominal and real shocks, the easing of capital controls is an inevitable requisite promoting development of China's domestic financial markets and integration with the global trade system and capital markets.Soft pegs with wide fluctuation bands or similar arrangements that retain certain capital controls could thus be adopted in the interim.Then, as China's financial markets develop and enterprises and banks begin to adhere consistently to market principles, a more flexible foreign exchange regime such as a managed float with relaxed capital controls could be introduced. Key words: China, exchange rate system, WTO accession .

The Russian financial markets are small for an economy the size of Russia, and in many respects underdeveloped. This restricts the Central Bank of Russia's scope for conducting monetary policy. In this paper we provide an overview of the Russian financial markets and the CBR's variegated collection of monetary policy tools and their effectiveness. The Russian monetary and exchange rate policy framework is currently in the process of change. During most of the 2000s, the CBR tightly steered the ruble's external value, which left little room for active monetary policy. After the 2008-2009 crisis, the bank began to loosen the reins of exchange rate management with the aim of moving gradually to a regime of inflation targeting. Since the monetary policy tools are still not highly effective, the big challenge for monetary authorities is improve the tools. Keywords: Russia, monetary policy, exchange rate policy .

This study assesses the causes of dollarization in Lithuania. Dollarization is defined here as the use of foreign currency both as a medium of exchange and store of value. The study observes that, as the theory suggests, the degree of dollarization (measured as the ratio of foreign currency deposits to M2) depends on the interest rate differential,.However, exchange rate movements do not offer any additional explanatory power to dollarization.In all likelihood, this depends on the currency board system currently in place in Lithuania.Devaluation expectations are probably embodied to a large extent in the interest rate differential.Degree of dollarization exhibits also some inertia. .

The foundation for this project based thesis comes from cookery courses given by the author in  Hiiden Opisto adult education centre in Lohja. Oriental, French, Thai, Food Journey to Europe, Indian and Italian cookery courses were given between autumn 2003 and spring 2005.   But why do people participate in cookery courses, what are the motives and why did they choose an ethnic or a European cookery course? It seems that people who have more travelling experience participate in the ethnic courses, are more willing to try new flavours and want new tastes in their cuisine. People participating in European cookery courses are more interested in cookery in general and want to use familiar ingredients in a new way.  The first adult education centre in Finland was formed in 1889 in Tampere and the aim was to offer evening education to workers. This notion is still valid today. Cookery courses are a part of adult education. Consumer behaviour in relation to food, Finnish restaurant culture and travelling habits were studied to find out why food interests people today.  Without urbanisation and an increase of standards of living, consuming and interest towards food as we know it, could not exist. The term consumer is only about a century old. Eating has become less formal and Finnish cuisine has diversified over the past decades.  Restaurant culture has experienced great changes from government strictly regulated necessity into a considerable business. Travelling increased in Finland in the 1970's and the most popular destination, relevant to cuisine, is Spain. Travelling has taught Finns to try new flavours and eat in restaurants but directly, it hasn't had a very extensive impact in formation of restaurants. Travelling has added new words such as feta, tapas, antipasto and meze into our vocabulary.   Hiiden Opisto adult education centre cookery courses were examined as project. Planning included familiarising with the food culture, identifying the most common dishes and recipes and clarifying the acquisition of ingredients. Implementation involved the acquisition of ingredients, teaching people about the food culture, ingredients and preparation methods and supervise the cooking. Results were identified by two feed back surveys and evaluation consisted on the analysis of these surveys.
