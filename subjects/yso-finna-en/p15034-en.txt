Theories of image formation
The aim and objectives of the thesis is to give an understanding and explanation of the customers' role within branding. Brands can be perceived from both the customers' point of view as well as the companies' point of view. However, the approach that brands exist first and foremost in the minds of consumers was applied throughout this thesis. The images customers have of brands should be thoroughly analyzed since consumers' thoughts, feelings and image towards a brand are providing managers with strategically and tactically guidelines to help them make brand decisions. Therefore, to successfully and efficiently manage their brand companies have to encompass a comprehensive understanding of their customers. This thesis studied the Swedish customers' image of the Tallink Silja Line brand. As a result, this thesis was done qualitatively, applying a case-study research approach. Structured interviews were conducted in order to obtain the Swedish customers' image of the brand. A total amount of 50 respondents participated in the study, all of them of Swedish nationality. Keller's brand image model was applied during the actual data collection and analysis process; the strength, favourability and uniqueness of the Swedish customers' associations were brought forth. By using Keller's brand image theory as a frame of reference a descriptive brand image framework of Tallink Silja Line was constructed. According to the findings the Swedish customers' image of Tallink Silja Line is relatively consistent and positive. The associations that were brought into view can be considered as strong and reliable as all of the 50 respondents were familiar with Tallink Silja Line and could relate to their own experiences with the brand.

Understanding the genetic architecture underlying complex multigene disorders is one of the major goals of human genetics in the upcoming decades. Advances in whole genome sequencing and the success of high throughput functional genomics allow supplementing conventional reductionist biology with systems-level approaches to human heredity and health as systems of interacting genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. This integrative approach holds the promise of unveiling yet unexplored levels of molecular organization and biological complexity. It may also hold the key to deciphering the multigene patterns of disease inheritance
