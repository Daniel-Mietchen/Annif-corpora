Technical math for dummies
This book concentrates on women in professional engineering in the light of the increasing number of women entering traditionally masculine professions in the last 20 years. The book raises the question of whether the price women engineers pay for their success is too high. The More...authors interviewed selected women engineers in both Britain and America and analyzed the results of their research in the context of other theoretical and statistical material to illuminate a number of issues central to all women's lives such as balancing work and motherhood and the effect of a very masculine working environment. The book also looks at what educational and other experiences play a part in women making a non-traditional career choice.
