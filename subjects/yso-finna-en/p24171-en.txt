Forest hydrology : an introduction to water and forests
Understanding earth
"A comprehensive review of dryland climates and their relationship to the physical environment, hydrology, and inhabitants. Chapters are divided into four major sections on background meteorology and climatology; the nature of dryland climates in relation to precipitation and hydrology; the climatology and climate dynamics of the major dryland regions on each continent; and an extensive review of long-term climate variability in the world's drylands. It includes key topics such as vegetation, geomorphology, desertification, micro-habitats, and adaptation to dryland environments. This interdisciplinary volume provides an extensive review of the primary literature (covering over 2500 references) and the conventional and satellite datasets that form key research tools for dryland climatology. Illustrated with over 100 photographs, it presents a unique view of dryland climates for a broad spectrum of researchers, environmental professionals and advanced students in climatology, meteorology, geography, environment science, earth system science, ecology, hydrology and geomorphology"--

"Both hydrologists and meteorologists need to speak a common scientific language, and this has given rise to the new scientific discipline of hydrometeorology, which deals with the transfer of water and energy across the land/atmosphere interface.Terrestrial Hydrometeorology is the first graduate-level text with sufficient breadth and depth to be used in hydrology departments to teach relevant aspects of meteorology, and in meteorological departments to teach relevant aspects of hydrology, and to serve as an introductory text to teach the emerging discipline of hydrometeorology.The book will be essential reading for graduate students studying surface water hydrology, meteorology, and hydrometeorology. It can also be used in advanced undergraduate courses, and will be welcomed by academic and professional hydrologists and meteorologists worldwide".

Designed to accompany the new Open University course in Environmental Monitoring and Protection, this is one of four new titles which will equip the reader with the tools to undertake Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). Used in planning, decision-making and management, EIAs review both the theoretical principles and environmental considerations of engineering and environmental projects to help steer fundamental legislation in the right direction. This book begins with a discussion of the basics of the hydrological cycle and a description of the natural aquatic environment including the no.
This study explains the role of forests in the hydrological cycle, with a particular focus on critical, "red flag" forest situations such as mountainous or steep terrain, river and coastal areas and swamp ecosystems, as well as the special case of mountainous small islands. It addresses the protection of municipal water supplies and emerging systems of payment for watershed services.--Publisher's description.

Terrestrial hydrometeorology
"This book on Terrestrial Hydrometeorology is needed because there is currently no single graduate level text with sufficient breadth across the hydrological and meteorological sciences that provides understanding with sufficient depth and detail in both disciples for use (a) in hydrology departments to teach relevant aspects of meteorology; (b) in meteorological departments to teach relevant aspects of surface hydrology; and (c) to teach the emerging discipline of hydrometeorology".
Pesticides and microbial degradation in the subsurface sediments in Finland
The objective of this study was to find alternative solutions to the problems of stormwater runoff, which has increased in recent years as a result of urbanization and climate change, as well as to develop new stormwater management methods for the new residential area of Rauhalinna located in a cold climate country. Stormwater is rainwater and melting snow which is not absorbed into the ground, but runs off and flows on hard surfaces such as roofs, parking lots, paved streets, and roads. Stormwater has harmful impacts on our cities, receiving water bodies and groundwater. Thus, the objectives of stormwater management are to mitigate stormwater runoff quantity and minimize flood risk, protect the receiving water bodies and groundwater, and reduce the load on the wastewater plant which causes high treatment cost, as well as to emphasize the development of a sustainable environment. The stormwater management in Finland faces two kinds of challenges. Firstly there is lack of information about rainwater and melting snow, and secondly the experiences of using new and integrated stormwater management systems in the cold and snowy climate of Finland are few and the stormwater legislations are quite young. In this study the dialectical and interrelated relationships between the hydrologic cycle, climate change and urbanization are discussed. Factors that should be considered when planning stormwater management systems such as land use and environmental conditions, municipal responsibilities and recommendations, and the features of the catchment area are dealt with. All new stormwater management systems promote and mimic the natural drainage system. In this thesis some of the new stormwater management methods and techniques which have come up to the use currently, especially in cold and snowy climate are highlighted. The municipality of Kaarina was provided with a comprehensive management system, which encompasses the underground storage system (cassette filed), rain gardens, green swales, pervious pavements and stone channels, in addition to the rain tanks.
