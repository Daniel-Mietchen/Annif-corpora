This study aimed to assess the ecological status of three urban ponds in the Tampere region by analysing their present condition in reference to previously conducted research as well as other reference criteria.  The main pond of interest was Sorsalampi, as it is presently in the focus of city development plans. The ecological condition of Hautalammi and Vaakkolammi was of interest as reference conditions and was determined simultaneously. The ponds were analysed during autumn/winter of 2009/10. The studied parameters include physiochemical elements, the nutrient level, as well as biological elements and sediment properties. The results of this study are in accordance with previously obtained results indicating that all three ponds are affected by urban and/or industrial pollution and are to a certain extent eutrophicated. According to the criteria of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union, the ecological status of Sorsalampi was estimated between “poor” and “bad”, whereas the status of Vaakkolammi was classified as “poor”. Hautalammi could not be classified.
