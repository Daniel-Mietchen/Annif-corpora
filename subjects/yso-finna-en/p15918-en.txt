Quality management in the imaging sciences
"This publication, the third edition of Mammographic Imaging: A Practical Guide, retains information on analog mammography, builds upon ongoing developments for breast imaging, and introduces new trends in the field of breast imaging. Specifically, there are five chapters related to digital mammography that address digital technology (machines, image acquisition, image manipulation, and storage), QC, comparisons to imaging with analog mammography, and changes in workflow for the mammography technologist"--Provided by publisher.

Objectives    This study aims to identify European radiographers' challenges in clinical performance in mammography and the main areas of mammography that require more and better training.      Methods    An extensive search was performed to identify relevant studies focused on clinical practice, education and training in mammography published between January 2010 and December 2015 in the English language. The data were analysed by using deductive thematic analysis.      Results    A total of 27 full text articles were read, evaluating their quality. Sixteen articles out of 27 were finally selected for this integrative review. The main challenges of radiographers' mammography education/training can be divided into three groups: training needs, challenges related to radiographers, and challenges related to the organization of education. The most common challenges of clinical performance in mammography among European radiographers involved technical performance, the quality of practices, and patient-centeredness.      Conclusions    The introduction of harmonized mammography guidelines across Europe may serve as an evidence-based tool to be implemented in practice and education. However, the variability in human and material resources as well as the different cultural contexts should be considered during this process.

"The thoroughly revised and expanded 4th edition of the bestselling "Teaching Atlas of Mammography" contains a significant number of new cases. Based on 40 years of experience, the superbly illustrated cases often show long-term follow-up of patients over a period of up to 25 years. Rather than starting with the diagnosis and demonstrating typical findings, the approach of this atlas is to teach the reader and allow him to practice through 154 paradigm cases: how to systematically review mammograms for even the most subtle hints of malignancy, and how to carefully analyze and evaluate the mammographic signs to reach the correct diagnosis. Still unique to this book is the correlation of imaging findings with the corresponding large thin-section and subgross, large thick-section (3D) histology to facilitate an understanding of the pathological processes leading to the mammographic appearances. This approach is the basis for a profound understanding of breast imaging because it is a direct and effective method of teaching differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases"--Provided by publisher.

Abstract.
This up-to-date, evidence-based book covers the whole range of mammography and mammography-related techniques used in practice, and also the rapid and increasingly sophisticated evolution of mammographic clinical practice and technology. A wide range of topics, from the psychological and emotional support required from the practitioner to all aspects of screening and symptomatic mammographic imaging, are discussed. Digital Mammography: A Holistic Approach is aimed at radiographers, technicians, technologists, physicists, nurses and medical practitioners worldwide, and enables the reader to gain a better understanding of techniques, equipment and anatomy.

Merrill's atlas of radiographic positions and radiologic procedures : volume two
"Encompassing the entire spectrum of breast imaging and diagnostics, this acclaimed text provides a systematic and pragmatic guide for all clinicians involved in diagnosing breast disease. The new third edition has been fully updated to include advances in mammography, ultrasound, breast MRI, percutaneous interventions, and emerging technologies, with pros and cons and evidence-based approaches throughout. Special features of the third edition: Coverage of the field, with comprehensive sections on examination procedures and technical requirements; histologic, clinical, and radiologic appearance of a wide range of breast pathologies; results of international screening studies; and much more. Nearly 1,200 clear radiographic images showing normal findings, benign and malignant disorders, and post-traumatic, post-surgical, and post-therapeutic changes to the breast. Innovations in digital mammography, tomosynthesis, and computer assisted detection (CAD); new chapters on imaging of implants, lesions of uncertain malignant potential, developing technologies; and more. A systematic, highly reproducible methodology for detection, diagnosis, and assessment of findings. Easy-to-follow flowcharts for the diagnostic work-up of both typical and atypical cases. Written by world-renowned authorities with decades of clinical experience, this book provides a brilliant orientation to the multimodality diagnostic approach and therapeutic significance of breast imaging findings. It is an essential reference and board review for radiologists, residents and fellows, gynecologists, oncologists, surgeons, technologists, and any other interdisciplinary specialist working to improve outcomes in breast disease"--Provided by publisher.
