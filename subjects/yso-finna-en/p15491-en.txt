"Abdominal imagers recognize that a formal rigid split between "GU" and "GI" radiology no longer works with the rapid advancements in cross sectional imaging that have occurred over the past generation. Nonetheless, when we began planning for the third edition of Diagnostic Imaging: Abdomen we realized that it was no longer possible to encompass the imaging and management of the entire spectrum of abdominal disorders in one text. We thus decided to separate diagnoses considered to be largely "genitourinary" (highlighted in this updated and expanded text) from topics judged to be "gastrointestinal" (covered in a corresponding, companion book). The Amirsys format of bulleted text - including key facts, imaging features, exam protocols, pathology, clinical manifestations/treatment and image interpretation pearls - is still employed.^Succinct, but exhaustive outlined descriptions of GU diagnoses are supplemented by image galleries that emphasize the pearls and pitfalls of modern GU imaging. The number of genitourinary diagnoses has been significantly expanded, and the utility of state of the art cross sectional imaging is emphasized in updated image panels. The approach mirrors current practice: examples of traditional imaging techniques utilized by GU radiologists decades ago (retrograde, intravenous urography, angiography etc.) have largely been replaced by their cross sectional counterparts (MDCT, MR, CTA, MRA, CT urography, MR urography) employed by present day abdominal imagers. Introductory narrative overview chapters describe relevant GU anatomy, physiology, imaging protocols and workup. GU oncology staging and interventional technique chapters - crucial material for current abdominal imagers - have also been added.^Finally, additional images and references are included in the Amirsys eBook Advantage that accompanies the print version of Diagnostic Imaging: Genitourinary, 3rd Edition. This new edition of Diagnostic Imaging: Genitourinary was compiled by members of the Abdominal Imaging section of the University of Pittsburgh. The section has a long history of excellent collaboration with one another, and with referring clinical services. This collaboration has resulted in a legacy of clinical and academic success, and will be even more important in a health care environment that appropriately emphasizes value over volume. We are confident that this updated edition will be a go-to, readily accessible, clinically relevant resource for abdominal imagers and trainees for years to come."--Provided by publisher.
