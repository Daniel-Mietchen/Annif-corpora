"Exploring questions of how and why the quality of a person's voice influences our perceptions, Foundations of Voice Studies provides a comprehensive introduction to, and analysis of, the multifaceted role that voice quality plays in our social lives. Beginning with an approachable and thorough overview of various aspects of vocal physiology and its control, Kreiman and Sidtis examine the neurological and sociological contexts for producing and listening to voices. Replete with fascinating sidebars and discussions of how voices are used in advertising and media, and legal and forensic issues of identifying voices, they have written an essential work that unifies the results of their own pioneering studies with the most current scientific literature. This unique and interdisciplinary volume on all facets of voice production and its perception is supported by sound files and additional material, available at www.wiley.com/go/voicestudies"--
