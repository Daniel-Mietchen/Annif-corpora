Explores a Range of Multiscale Biomechanics/Mechanobiology ConceptsCell and Matrix Mechanics presents cutting-edge research at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels in the field of cell mechanics. This book involves key experts in the field, and covers crucial areas of cell and tissue mechanics, with an emphasis on the roles of mechanical forces in cell-matrix interactions. Providing material in each chapter that builds on the previous chapters, it effectively integrates length scales and contains, for each length scale, key experimental observations and corresponding quantitative theoret.
