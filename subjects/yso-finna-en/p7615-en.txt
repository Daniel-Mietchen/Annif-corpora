Headlines of daily newspapers announce that 90% of all German employees do not feel satisfied  at work. This statement contradicts with the increasing importance of innovative and motivated  people that are needed by modern companies. Technological modernization and automation lead  to global competition and growing challenges for all companies being part of the international  economic system. These developments hide the request for unique and personalized services that  have to be designed for demanding customers by employees being proactive problem-solvers.  Combining the corporate success with employee's satisfaction is seen as the modern challenge for  HR Managers during the 21st century and defines the focus of this thesis report.  The search for an answer firstly lead to the investigation of various theories on basic human  needs and demonstrated the development of corresponding motivational methods towards a  more intangible approach called intrinsic motivation. Nowadays employees demand different  rewards from work than 20 years ago. The growth of the service industry has been the release for  testing the need for a modernized motivational model at hotels belonging to that sector.  Aiming to examine the sustainable impact of intrinsic motivation, the empirical research tested  the current satisfaction level and rewarding preferences from staff members belonging to  different hierarchical levels of a 5-star luxury hotel. Consequently the openness of modern staff  for new motivational models was spotted and starting points for the method's implementation  could be identified. People stressed their tendency towards intangible motivators but never forgot  to mention financial security. Findings from empirical research also revealed the request for a  motivational model stimulating people's ability to realize their full potential and express their  personality by simultaneously benefiting the corporate success. This desire stresses career  supporting opportunities and support for cross-departmental communication.  Finally, the combination of literature review findings and empirical results formed the fundament  for creating innovative implications for future managers who try to benefit the company as well  as their staff members. The establishment of a model that revives people's passion for  performing a job and intends to direct people's attention towards intrinsic motivators  constituting one step towards a long-term motivation. On the basis of ensuring a fair salary the  new strategy tries to deflect people's focus on monetary reward by stressing personal growth  potential.
