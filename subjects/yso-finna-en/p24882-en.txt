Value creation in collaboration between software suppliers and customers : suppliers’ perspective
The purpose of the research is to study how Hennes & Mauritz AB's brand is perceived in social media. The topic is of current interest as the phenomenon of social media marketing and communication is expanding. More and more companies are using social media as a platform to communicate with their customers. The research concentrates on H&M's brand and how the customers are experiencing the brand in one of the social media platforms, Facebook. The research objective is to discover if the H&M brand is perceived by the customers as H&M intends and if the customers and H&M are receiving any additional value from the social media communication. The research examines both local and global news feeds of H&M to describe the results from the global, as well as from Finland's, point of view. The empirical material of this research is based on the qualitative research method. Firstly, an interview with H&M's marketing and communications manager in Finland was  analysed to find out how H&M expects its brand to be experienced in social media; secondly, the news feeds and customer comments of H&M's Facebook page were observed and analysed, during 1.2 – 11.3.2012, to detect how the customers perceive the H&M brand. From a general perspective, the results show that H&M has succeeded in their brand delivery. The customer perception is in unison with H&M's marketing and communication strategy, and both customers and the company are receiving added value from social media interaction. The research reveals strong and weak points in the social media communication, for the company to improve and develop its strategy in social media. From the local point of view, conclusions were hard to make due to the low level of participation; however, observation of local customers' interaction revealed that they focus more on quality, information and advice-oriented topics.

Supply Manager’s Role Development In Industrial Supply Chain Process
Today, competitive advantage cannot be gained through improving the products or lowering the prices. Advantage over the competitors must be searched from new sources, for example by focusing on customer experience. In addition the value created in the past, can be important when the customer is making the purchasing decision in the future. The changes in the consumer's wants and needs are driving companies to make changes in their business strategy. Concept of customer experience refers to finding out the needs of the customer; in order to gain competitive advantage. In addition, focusing on negative impressions is important, as people tend to share their experiences to their friends and family  this makes customer experience a marketing tool. Focusing on different aspects of customer experience is important, as customers should be the core of the business  without the customers there is no need for the company. Companies should focus on developing customer experience in order to make the customer do transactions in the future as well. The topic for this bachelor's thesis was given by the case company; Limingan Osuuspankki. During my internship, the case company wanted to conduct a research focusing on customer experience as the case company wanted to focus on develop in creating experiences for the customers. As the case company had no previous experience on the topic, the goal of this research was to find out what kind of customer experience does the customers of the case company have and to find suggestions for developing it. This study focused on different aspects of customer experience, for example - how it is created and how it can be measured. All in all, developing customer experience is dependent on many different factors. Different tools for measuring customer experience, give only one viewpoint into phenomena. ^

Desire is big business. If companies can create true desirability for their brand, customers will not only express preference and loyalty, they also show a willingness to act as brand champions, participate in online communities, co-create innovative ideas, and show the sort of commitment that is normally associated with fervent employees. However, desire doesn't just happen. Brands need to nurture it by offering security and surprise.

This thesis is a quantitative research project commissioned by Hellsten Hotel Apartments. The aim of the thesis is to study guest perceptions of Hellsten Hotel Apartments approached through service quality. Furthermore, the management view of guest expectations is included to form a holistic picture of how service quality can be managed.     The framework of the study consists of an extensive literature review exploring models of service quality and the influencing factors of guest expectations and perceptions present in the formation of perceived service quality. Moreover, the GAP-model is used as a theoretical framework to approach the research problem, and methods and issues of measuring service quality in relation to the chosen model are discussed.    The research is conducted through a survey based on the SERVQUAL instrument, measuring customer expectations and experience and comparing them to obtain a view of satisfaction with the quality.     The survey was webbased and distributed to hotel guests, and 172 answers were obtained for analysis. In addition, a modified version of the questionnaire measuring manager perceptions of guest expectations was responded to by a total of five managers.    The key findings of the study were that guest expectations are met on most aspects of the service and that managers were well informed about guest expectations. Although overall satisfaction can be assumed, the results indicate that attention should be paid to service specifications and performance in attributes related to cleanliness and staff assurance.

The purpose of the thesis was to make a customer satisfaction survey for the case company in order to figure out the customer satisfaction level in the company. The objective of the thesis study was to find out if there has happened any change in the customer satisfaction after the previous survey (carried out in 2006). Also the objective of the thesis study was to figure out if the change of ownership (happened in 2013) has influenced to the customer satisfaction. The main objective for the author was to learn more about customer relation management, customer satisfaction and the process of making the customer satisfaction survey.  The idea of making the customer satisfaction survey came from the case company Forchem Oy since they haven't issued any satisfaction surveys for a while. The customer satisfaction survey was carried out as an email survey. The author sent the customers email with a cover letter and in the end of the email the customer could open the survey by clicking the link for the questionnaire. The questionnaire had 5 questions and it was sent to the customers in the middle of February. Customers had 13 days' time to answer and four days before the deadline was sent a reminder. The questions of the questionnaire were partly based on the previous questionnaire. Due to the fact that the previous survey was carried out nine years ago all answers were not comparable.  The thesis study includes the theory part where the author has introduced background for the customer satisfaction survey. Factors like customer relationship management, customer satisfaction and customer satisfaction measurement were explained in the theory part. After the theory part the author has explained the process of making the questionnaire. The research findings are in the chapter 8. Based on the answers of questionnaire, the author made figures to explain the results. In the end of the thesis study are recommendations for the case company as well as the most important findings of the level of customer satisfaction. The very important recommendation for the case company is that the case company should carry out the customer satisfaction survey in frequent time periods. This would help the company to get closer to the customer needs and wishes and also be able to hear more ideas what to develop for example.
Describes how companies can truly understand the needs of their customers by seeing a business through their eyes and enforcing the concept of customer service through every facet of the company, from finance to legal to marketing.

A customer satisfaction is a important part of building a successful company. Customers are the best way to measure the company's need of the development and find out what the customers are satisfied of. The author chose to do a research about the customer satisfaction in a small accommodation company called Kaksi Kalaa. It was the first formal and textual customer satisfaction for this company. There exist many researches and theories of how to measure the customer satisfaction. In this case the research was conducted as a questionnaire survey.
