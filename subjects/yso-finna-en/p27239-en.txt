Behind Valkyrie : German resistance to Hitler : documents
Niemandsland is the untold story of the largest and most enduring of the unoccupied enclaves that survived after Germany's invasion and occupation by Allied forces in 1945. Sandwiched between American and Red Army lines, the 500,000 inhabitants were cut off from the outside world and left to fend for themselves in the face of crippling shortages of food, fuel and housing. Gareth Pritchard charts how groups of Communists, Socialists and antifascists came together to form 'antifascist' committees which seized power and set about restoring order, ensuring the supply of food and essential services and hunting down, disarming and arresting fugitive Nazis. This is not only a fascinating history in its own right but it also sheds important new light on the fate of Germany after 1945. Only in Niemandsland do we see what happened when the currents of post-Nazi German politics were allowed to flow freely, unimpeded by Allied intervention.
While the "Valkyrie" plot to kill Hitler is the best known instance of German oppositon to his dictatorship, there were many other significant acts of resistance. Behind Valkyrie collects the documents, letters, and testimonies - many available in their entirety and in English for the first time - of Germans who fought Hitler from within.

Free to hate : the rise of the right in post-communist Eastern Europe
From 1938 until 1943 - before the German occupation and accompanying Holocaust - Fascist Italy drafted and enforced a comprehensive set of anti-Semitic laws. Notwithstanding later rationalizations, the laws were enforced and administered with a high degree of severity and resulted in serious, and in some cases permanent, damage to the Italian Jewish community. Written from the perspective of an American legal scholar, this book constitutes the first truly comprehensive survey of the Race Laws in the English language. Based on an exhaustive review of Italian legal, administrative, and judicial sources, together with archives of the Italian Jewish community, Professor Michael A. Livingston demonstrates the zeal but also the occasional ambivalence and contradictions with which the Race Laws were applied and assimilated by the Italian legal order and ordinary citizens. Although frequently depressing, the history of the Race Laws also involves numerous examples of personal courage and idealism, and provides a useful and timely study of what happens when otherwise decent people are confronted with an evil and unjust legal order.-

The aim of the second part of the project on the impact of the racial laws under the Mussolini regime is to offer the reader a critical edition and an English translation of 139 letters that were exchanged between the victims of those laws (and their relatives and friends) and the Jesuit Pietro Tacchi Venturi (1861-1956) who interceded with the Fascist government in order to circumvent or alleviate various provisions of the 1938 anti-Jewish legislation.

Published in 1937, twelve years before Orwell's 1984, Swastika Night projects a totally male-controlled fascist world that has eliminated women as we know them. Women are breeders, kept as cattle, while men in this post-Hitlerian world are embittered automatons, fearful of all feelings, having abolished all history, education, creativity, books, and art. The plot centers on a misfit who asks, “How could this have happened?”

The book is a remarkable piece of modern history which tells the story - for the first time - of a speech that was written by Pope Pius XI in 1939 in which he was intending to speak out against Mussolini and the Fascists and condemn anti-Semitism.
