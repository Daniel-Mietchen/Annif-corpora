In the ancient heart of Oxford University, the ultra-rich celebrate their vastly extended lifespans. But a few surprises are in store for them. From Nina and Alex, Margo and Fidget, scruffy anarchists sharing living space with an ever-shifting cast of crusty punks and lost kids. And also from the scientist who invented the longevity treatment in the first place. / WorldCat.

Many current public health actions and policies aimed at older people revolve around the often prevailing view that failing health is a consequence of ageing. It is now clear that it is possible to postpone or even prevent much of the age-related decline in health that was once thought inevitable. Future policies must recognise this changing paradigm, and, using a multi-disciplinary approach, integrate fully the changing needs of older people into all areas of public policy including health, nutrition, social support, housing, and economic security. Derived from the 47th Annual Symposium of the Society for the Study of Human Biology in November 2005, Ageing Well: Nutrition, Health, and Social Interventions highlights important health and social factors affecting quality of life in older age, and reviews possible interventions aimed at the prevention or amelioration of problems that reduce the potential for ageing well. Covering a wide range of topics, contributors address the nutritional vulnerability and specific nutritional needs of older adults and confirm the necessity of appropriate diet and exercise in order to maintain both physical and cognitive health. Reminiscence, social interaction and support are highlighted as crucial for the preservation of identity, health and emotional well-being. Other chapters are concerned with socio-economic differences in the extent of age-related changes in health, resulting particularly from poor quality housing and lack of family support networks. The book includes an examination of the economic consequences for health care systems and pension schemes of ageing populations, provides insight into the methodology of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and outlines how the minimum cost of healthy living for the 65+ population can be estimated.Bringing together the very latest information on successful ageing, Ageing Well: Nutrition, Health, and Social Interventions presents an up-to-date synthesis of the current evidence of nutrition, public health and social interventions aiming to ensure health and good quality of life in older age.

Part exploration, part knowledge building, and part narration, Work and the Older Person: Increasing Longevity and Well-Being draws on the latest research from a variety of disciplines and resources to paint a complete picture of productivity in old age. Dr. Linda A. Hunt and Caroline E. Wolverson, along with 11 contributors, discuss the relationship between work and aging and highlight the importance of working into old age. Each chapter of Work and the Older Person focuses on narratives from older workers that support the evidence presented with personal stories. These stories illustrate the opportunities, challenges, frustrations, and choices that older people face in maintaining a productive lifestyle. Simultaneously, the text highlights current events and the economy largely within Western societies and discusses the struggle some countries have supplying the financial benefits paid to retirees. Overall, the text shows how working into old age can contribute to longevity and greater quality of life. Occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, gerontologists, social workers, psychologists, and those working with older people in the health and social care sector will appreciate the inspiring accounts from older workers discussing how work contributes to their self-identity, quality of life, health, and well-being. Work and the Older Person: Increasing Longevity and Well-Being shows how engaging in occupations brings purpose to people's lives. The text will be of value to all professionals working with older adults, as well as older adults themselves looking to maintain a productive lifestyle.
