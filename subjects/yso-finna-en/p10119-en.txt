Abstract: Corporate responsibility reporting based on GRI reporting standard : development of reporting of case companies Cargolux, Finnair and SAS. This thesis examined the corporate responsibility (CR) reporting. The thesis consists of theoretical part and a multiple case study, in which the CR reports of three European airlines are analysed. All of the case companies are reporting according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which is the most commonly used reporting standard globally. The aim of the study was to find out how the CR reports of the case companies have developed during the past five years and how well the reports match the GRI reporting guidelines. Also some conclusions were drawn on how the reports could be improved further. This study was conducted by using qualitative research methods. The theoretical part was constructed by thorough research of literature on the topic. The main sources of information for the case study were the CR reports of the case companies from the past five years. Also an interview of one company representative was conducted to gain insight to matters that were left unanswered after the study of the literature and the reports. The findings of the study show that GRI guidelines set a good basis for the reporting, but still leave enough latitude for the companies to emphasise the matters they find the most relevant. It was noticed that environmental issues were given the most space in the reports, but during the recent years there has been a significant rise in the reporting of social matters.

COPING WITH ILLNESS & SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. 'A week after my 50th birthday and just as our family was about to move home, something happened that changed the way I looked at life. I spoke to others about how they rebuilt their shattered worlds after very different personal traumas, emerging stronger than before. I hope our experiences, together with the latest science on resilience, will help guide all those going through tough times. This book says that it's possible not just to survive them, but to thrive. To rise.' Renowned as a much-loved and highly respected journalist and broadcaster with thirty years' experience, Sian Williams has studied the impact of acute stress for many years and is also a trained trauma assessor. In RISE, she explores the science of resilience and growth after trauma, offers advice from the experts, and learns from those who have emerged from horrific experiences, feeling changed yet stronger, with a new perspective on their life, their relationships and their work.

Although urban allotment gardening dates back to the nineteenth century, it has recently undergone a renaissance of interest and popularity. This is the result of greater concern over urban greenspace, food security and quality of life. This book presents a comprehensive, research-based overview of the various features, benefits and values associated with urban allotment gardening in Europe. The book is based on a European COST Action project, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over Europe for the first detailed exploration of the subject on a continent-wide scale. It assesses the policy, planning and design aspects, as well as the social and ecological benefits of urban allotment gardening. Through an examination of the wide range of different traditions and practices across Europe, it brings together the most recent research to discuss the latest evolutions of urban allotment gardening and to help raise awareness and fill knowledge gaps. The book provides a multidisciplinary perspective, including insights from horticulture and soil science, ecology, sociology, urban geography, landscape, planning and design. The themes are underpinned by case studies from a number of European countries which supply a wide range of examples to illustrate different key issues.

The goal of this thesis is to analyse the level of sustainability of one souvenir shop. The case company Maretarium is an aquarium located in Kotka, Southern Finland and beside Finnish fish; the aquarium offers customers also The Sea Shop, a souvenir shop filled with products of underwater life. Maretarium wants to follow trends and develop the shop in more a sustainable direction. Sustainable development is one of the main trends at this moment globally. This analysis presents the main aspects of sustainability and how sustainable development can be seen in souvenir business. One wide part of sustainability is Fair Trade and other green labels which encourage suppliers and retailers to pay attention to fair, ecologically and sustainably produced products. Use of recycled material is also one way to produce new products in a sustainable way. Additionally, consumer behaviour affects also retail trends and it has been researched that shopping souvenirs and buying other goods follow the same trends. Based on the analysis, the aim is to create a list of criteria to be fulfilled for sustainable souvenir shop. The analysis rests heavily on secondary data analysis. Secondary data is collected from the case company's suppliers. The souvenir shop and its level of sustainability are evaluated through its suppliers as it is one part of the aquarium's business operations. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that The Sea Shop is quite sustainable even if there are still some areas of improvement needed to increase sustainability. The case company should choose carefully its suppliers and should encourage suppliers to embrace sustainable thinking. Therefore, based on the analysis, I propose ten main principles to implement sustain-ability in a souvenir shop which I will implement at my work as the employee of Maretarium.

This study examines the Russian public finance system. It provides a description of the main fiscal reforms introduced by the Government from the moment of dissolution of the USSR, which enabled a reduction in the economy's dependency on nonrenewable resources. In scrutinizing the fiscal stabilization, we conduct a fiscal impulse factor analysis and estimate the degree of the fiscal-policy cyclicality in the period 2000-2013. The estimates show fiscal policy was procyclical in 2006-2008 and stabilizing during the rest of the period. The study also discusses fiscal sustainability issues for the period up to 2050 under two socio-economic scenarios. The size of the necessary fiscal consolidation under the current fiscal strategy is calculated and an alternative strategy is investigated.  Keywords: fiscal framework, fiscal policy, fiscal sustainability, Russia .
