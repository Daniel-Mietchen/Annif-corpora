Kenya is a developing country threatened by a severe loss of forests and degradation of biodiversity. Several indigenous tree species have become rare. Planting trees is a way to avert the environmental threats caused by forest loss such as the decrease in water supply. Environmental conservation efforts of Egerton University in Kenya were evaluated. The university donated over 24 000 tree seedlings to different communities in 2002-2004. The survival rates and differences between different tree species were evaluated. To support the study, a tree herbarium was prepared. The survival rates of the seedlings were investigated with field inventories. The beneficiaries were also interviewed on taking care of the seedlings. The specimens for the tree herbarium were collected both in Egerton University Botanic Garden and during various field visits. The average survival rate for the seedlings was 54 %. The main reason for the poor survival was freely grazing animals. The exotic tree species survived better than the indigenous ones because of their better resistance and more rapid growth.
