Summary.
"Regularization techniques" is the common name for a variety of methods used to make sense of divergent series, divergent integrals, or traces of linear operators in infinite-dimensional spaces. Such methods are often indispensable in problems of number theory, geometry, quantum field theory, and other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. However arbitrary and noncanonical they might seem at first glance, regularized sums, integrals, and traces often contain canonical concepts, and the main purpose of this book is to illustrate and explain this. This book provides a unified and self-contained mathematical treatment of various regularization techniques. The author shows how to derive regularized sums, integrals, and traces from certain canonical building blocks of the original divergent object. In the process of putting together these "building blocks", one encounters many problems and ambiguities caused by various so-called anomalies, which are investigated and explained in detail. Nevertheless, it turns out that the corresponding canonical sums, integrals, sums, and traces are well behaved, thus making the regularization procedure possible and manageable.
Analysis Volume IV introduces the reader to functional analysis (integration, Hilbert spaces, harmonic analysis in group theory) and to the methods of the theory of modular functions (theta and L series, elliptic functions, use of the Lie algebra of SL2).

Advanced modern engineering mathematics
This book is an introduction to analytic number theory suitable for beginning graduate students. It covers everything one expects in a first course in this field, such as growth of arithmetic functions, existence of primes in arithmetic progressions, and the Prime Number Theorem. But it also covers more challenging topics that might be used in a second course, such as the Siegel-Walfisz theorem, functional equations of L-functions, and the explicit formula of von Mangoldt. For students with an interest in Diophantine analysis, there is a chapter on the Circle Method and Waring's Problem. Those with an interest in algebraic number theory may find the chapter on the analytic theory of number fields of interest, with proofs of the Dirichlet unit theorem, the analytic class number formula, the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function, and the Prime Ideal Theorem.
