Evaluation and properties of formulated low calories functional yoghurt cake
The aim of this study was to prepare and evaluate a formulated functional yoghurt cake using hot water extract of stevia leaves as a sweetener. The ingredients of the regular yoghurt cake were replaced by both low caloric value and functional ingredients. Sucrose was replaced by hot water extract of stevia, butter was replaced by olive oil, full cream milk was replaced by skimmed milk, whole egg was replaced by egg white and 72% extraction wheat flour was replaced by whole wheat flour. Orange peels and lemon rind were also added to the formulated yoghurt with stevia extract. Sensory evaluations for both the regular yoghurt cake and formulated yoghurt cake for diabetics were carried out using scores of the appearance, color, odor, flavor, texture and overall acceptability. The obtained results showed that the regular yoghurt cake and formulated yoghurt cake for diabetics have a good score. The biological evaluation of rat blood parameters of control and yoghurt cake for diabetics groups showed that bilirubin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, blood glucose and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( gamma -GT) values (means) in yoghurt cake for diabetics group were similar to results obtained in regular yoghurt cake group. There was a slight decrease in urea and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (37.05 mg/dl and 86.82 U/L, respectively) values in yoghurt cake for diabetics group compared with control (43.26 mg/dl and 97.00 U/L, respectively). It was concluded that formulated functional yoghurt cake containing hot water extract of stevia, whole wheat flour, egg white, skimmed milk, yoghurt, orange peel lemon rind and olive oil would be a great meal for diabetics.
