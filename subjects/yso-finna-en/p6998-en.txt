search services
In 1998, Moscow-born Sergey Brin and Midwest-born Larry Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford University to, in their own words, "change the world" through a search engine that would organize every bit of information on the Web for free. While the company has done exactly that, Google's quest continues as it seeks to add millions of library books, television broadcasts, and more to its searchable database. Readers will learn about the business acumen and computer wizardry that started the company on its astonishing course; the secret network of computers delivering lightning-fast search results; the unorthodox approach that has enabled it to challenge Microsoft's dominance and shake up Wall Street. Even as it rides high, Google wrestles with difficult choices that will enable it to continue expanding while sustaining the guiding vision of its founders' mantra: Do no evil.--From publisher description.

Abstract: Metadata driven data utilization in ecommerce solution. The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to develop a proof of concept with SharePoint for ecommerce site that uses search index to provide data. The study concentrated in evaluating features that are seen important in online commerce web sites and how their implementations would suffice in the application platform, which has seen little use in online commerce. As a result an ecommerce site that utilizes SharePoint 2013 features to fulfill common ecommerce site requirements as well as possible was created. The site uses search index as data provider for the customer site and it has a separate site for product administration that is indexed. The project required architectural research and understanding of metadata and its use in search services for creating queries and faceted navigation. The project application platform was found to include many metadata enhanced search functionalities. Ecommerce features were found existing and working but lacking for extensive use. As products are queried from search index there are insufficient information about user preferences or behavior for personalized product promotions. Missing shopping cart functionality was also noted. Search functions described in this project can be used to develop search-driven content utilization also with other content types.
