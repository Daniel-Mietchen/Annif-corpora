Novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o has been a force in African literature for decades: Since the 1970s, when he gave up the English language to commit himself to writing in African languages, his foremost concern has been the critical importance of language to culture. Here, Ngugi explores Africa's historical, economic, and cultural fragmentation by slavery, colonialism, and globalization. Throughout this tragic history, a constant and irrepressible force was Europhonism: the replacement of native names, languages, and identities with European ones. The result was the dismemberment of African memory. Seeking to remember language in order to revitalize it, Ngugi's quest is for wholeness. Wide-ranging, erudite, and hopeful, this book is a cri de coeur to save Africa's cultural future.--From publisher description.

"Cross-cultural exchange has characterized the economic life of India since antiquity. Its long coastline has afforded convenient access to Asia and Africa, and trading partnerships formed in the exchange of commodities ranging from textiles to military technology and opium to indigo. In a journey across 2,000 years, this enthralling book written by a leading South Asian historian, describes the ties of trade, migration, and investment between India and the rest of the world, showing how changing patterns of globalization reverberated on economic policy, politics, and political ideology within India. Along the way, the book asks three major questions. Is this a particularly Indian story? When did the big turning points happen? And is it possible to distinguish the modern from the pre-modern pattern of exchange? These questions invite a new approach to the study of Indian history by placing the region squarely at the center of the narrative. This is global history written on India,Ŵs terms and, as such, the book invites South Asian, Indian, and global historians to rethink both their history and their methodologies"--

"As the British, French and Spanish Atlantic empires were torn apart in the Age of Revolution, Portugal steadily pursued reforms to tie its American, African and European territories more closely together. Eventually, after a period of revival and prosperity, the Luso-Brazilian world also succumbed to revolution, which ultimately resulted in Brazil's independence from Portugal. The first of its kind in the English language to examine the Portuguese Atlantic World in the period from 1750 to 1850, this book reveals that despite formal separation, the links and relationships that survived the demise of empire entwined the historical trajectories of Portugal and Brazil even more deeply. From constitutionalism to economic policy to the problem of slavery, Portuguese and Brazilian statesmen and political writers laboured under the long shadow of empire as they sought to begin anew and forge stable post-imperial orders on both sides of the Atlantic"--

Toward the decolonization of African literature. Vol. 1, African fiction and poetry and their critics
Literary production is increasingly shaped by globalization and the complex nature of cultural, political, and social interaction. As such, longstanding colonial and postcolonial relations between Africa and Europe have yielded a range of challenging questions, and new generations of writers with roots in Africa have invariably found themselves navigating new geographic terrains and negotiating racialized identities, while simultaneously exploring the potential of literature in addressing these historical transitions. Linguistic challenges often accompany writing in global diasporic settings and are usually closely tied to colonial influence. More recently, however, authors residing in geographic spaces outside of colonially-defined migratory spaces have also been confronted with alternative challenges as they endeavour to translate experience. Building on, and in dialogue with, existing scholarship in related fields, and alongside discussions of Caribbean, French, and North African literature, individual chapters in Afroeuropean Cartographies offer a multi-sited, transnational, and interdisciplinary framework with which to consider the increasing pertinence of critical categories such as Afroeuropeanism or Afropeanism, and how these might assist in circumscribing the diverse influences shaping literary production. Afroeuropean authors consider the demands and exigencies associated with life in Europe, while also revealing the multiple ways in which identities are necessarily being redefined. In addition, they emphasize the historical dimension of these relationships, suggest how co-existence could be achieved, and delineate the coordinates of a larger project of communal existence and twenty-first century community-building. Afroeuropean Cartographies points to the vibrancy, ingenuity, creativity, and capacity of writers to imagine the contours of a diverse and inclusive Europe, underscoring the ways in which the concerns and objectives of Afroeuropeans are inseparable from Europeans' own reckoning with colonial history and its legacy, and, of course, from the broader project of Europeanization.

"In this era of recognition and reconciliation in settler societies indigenous peoples are laying claims to tribunals, courts and governments and reclaiming extensive territories and resource rights, in some cases even political sovereignty. But, paradoxically, alongside these practices of decolonization, settler societies continue the work of colonization in myriad everyday ways. This book explores this ongoing colonization in indigenous-settler identity politics in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. These four are part of the 'Post-British World' and share colonial orientations towards indigenous peoples traceable to their European origins. The book identifies a shared settler imaginary that continues to constrain indigenous possibilities while it fails to deliver the redemption and unified nationhood settler peoples crave. Against this colonizing imaginary this book argues for the need for a new relational imaginary that recognizes the autonomy of indigenous ways of being, living and knowing"--

V.Y. Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960's to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe's trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe's texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe's intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, E. W. Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S. Senghor, Patrice Nganang, and Achille Mbembe). -- Publisher's description.
