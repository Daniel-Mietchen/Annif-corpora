Abstract in Finnish.
"The new edition of this seminal textbook reflects how recent research and changes in health and education services have affected the decision-making process in the assessment and management of children with speech and language problems. Individual chapters written by experts in their field illustrate how the decisions made by practitioners may vary within different work settings and how they may need to be adapted when working with specific client groups. They also show how such decisions are part of effective evidence-based practice. The book provides an overview of the skills required by the developing professional and offers insight into working as a newly qualified therapist in the current job market. The ways in which speech and language therapists work with colleagues from other disciplines are also considered. An important textbook for speech and language therapy students, potential students and specialist teachers in training, Speech and Language Therapy: the decision-making process when working with children will also be relevant to newly qualified therapists, therapists returning to the profession, specialist teachers and Special Educational Needs Coordinators.
