"We are witnessing the greatest shift of wealth from poor to rich in history. In the United States alone, the wealthiest avoid paying an astonishing $53 billion in taxes each year. Nicholas Shaxson, in league with the Tax Justice Network, dives deep into the secret world of tax havens and takes us to hot spots from Switzerland to Panama to Delaware in a riveting narrative of how society loses through illegal tax evasion. With jaw-dropping stories and vivid explanations, Shaxson highlights the biggest players in the game, and shows how: - More than 12,750 foreign corporations get out of paying taxes each year by claiming to have offices in the same five-story building in the Cayman Islands. - One thousand children die every day as a result of illegal, trade related tax evasion. - Although billions are poured annually into Africa, corrupt officials there stow twice as much away in tax havens, making Africa a net creditor to the rest of the world.

"This fascinating history explores the dynamic relationship between overseas colonisation and the bodily experience of eating. It reveals the importance of food to the colonial project in Spanish America and reconceptualises the role of European colonial expansion in shaping the emergence of ideas of race during the Age of Discovery. Rebecca Earle shows that anxieties about food were fundamental to Spanish understandings of the new environment they inhabited and their interactions with the native populations of the New World. Settlers wondered whether Europeans could eat New World food, whether Indians could eat European food and what would happen to each if they did. By taking seriously their ideas about food we gain a richer understanding of how settlers understood the physical experience of colonialism and of how they thought about one of the central features of the colonial project. The result is simultaneously a history of food, colonialism and race.

Distribution System Analysis and Automation
This Bachelor’s thesis was commissioned by OY LM Ericsson AB. The work was done at Ericsson’s premises in Oulu. Oulu premises concentrate on re-search and development of base station solutions for WCDMA and LTE-networks. The purpose of this thesis was to automate base station test cases in a real RNC-environment in a WCDMA-network, mainly traffic cases that measure average throughput in different conditions and settings. The main aim of this automation was to automate some of the testing so that human resources that were consumed by this basic testing could be assigned to something more useful. And of course automation could bring much needed stability and better regression to testing. Other aims were to document the used equipment and choose test cases to automate. The aims were achieved so that the chosen transfer multi-RAB and soft hando-ver test cases were automated. All of the test cases are not possible to auto-mate but few more should be possible. Unfortunately that was not possible in time reserved for this thesis. The used equipment was also documented. Auto-mation is in use for daily software release testing now. This automation could be taken further for example by attaching a signal ana-lyzer with an Ethernet connection. This would enable antenna power measurements. Robustness testing cases are possible to add to this system. Adding a third base station to the attenuator would add many different variations for handovers.
