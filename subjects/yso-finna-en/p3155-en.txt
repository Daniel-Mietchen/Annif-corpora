Statistical yearbook 2000 = Annuaire statistique 2000
Foreign trade statistics based on value added follow the value added by each country and sector through the different phases of the production process. A new database maintained by the OECD and WTO provides a different picture of the imbalances in trade flows between the major economic regions and the interdependency of imports and exports than that provided by traditional customs statistics. This article also examines imbalances in euro area trade on a value-added basis. Statistics based on value added do not displace the traditional gross foreign trade statistics, but offer an alternative way to examine the importance of foreign trade, particularly for those countries that are integrated into global value chains. .

"Reliable statistics of occupational accidents are necessary for rational improvement of safety of seafarers by benchmarking. Several organisations regularly publish maritime occupational accident data, but the comparisons and benchmarking are difficult for several reasons, which are discussed in this commentary. For this purpose, the content of published information was analysed in view of similar features and the possibilities of joint uses of the data were reviewed for four Nordic countries. The main purpose of this publication is to start a discussion on how the statistic information of maritime occupational accidents could be made comparable for the Nordic countries. The project CAFE was funded by the EU, the Regional Council of Päijät-Häme, Turku University of Applied Sciences and the participants from the industry. " --
