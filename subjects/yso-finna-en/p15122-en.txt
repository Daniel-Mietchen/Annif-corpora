"The book is about a visual language for creating blueprints and maps of programs: Codecharts. It is written for practitioners who wish to cut the costs of software development with Java, C++, C# and other dominant programming languages. To be most effective, Codecharts are presented in a visually attractive form that is accessible to professionals and students alike: One or more sample charts appear on every page of the book, modeling programs that every programmer is familiar with"--

"Open source and easy to use, Python offers the availability of exciting libraries of software, application programming interfaces, and even connections to web services. This textbook uses Python as a working environment to teach the basics of computing for students with no prior programming experience. Unlike similar texts, it organizes topics based on a functional first approach to teaching programming. The book includes case studies of practical problems as well as homework and interactive tools online, such as flashcards"--
