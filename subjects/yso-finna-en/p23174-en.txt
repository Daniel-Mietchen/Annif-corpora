With approximately 1 in 6 adults likely to experience a significant mental health problem at any one time (Office for National Statistics), research into effective interventions has never been more important. During the past decade there has been an increasing interest in the role that sport and physical activity can play in the treatment of mental health problems, and in mental health promotion. The benefits resulting from physiological changes during exercise are well documented, including improvement in mood and control of anxiety and depression. Research also suggests that socio-cultural and psychological changes arising from engagement in sport and physical activity carry valuable mental health benefits. Sport and Physical Activity for Mental Health is an evidence-based practical guide for nurses, allied health professionals, social workers, physical activity leaders, and sport coaches. The authors provide comprehensive analysis of a broad range of client narratives, integrating theory and the latest research to explore the effectiveness of various interventions. The book offers readers detailed recommendations, suggestions, and ideas as to how sport and physical activity opportunities can be tailored to provide the greatest mental health benefits.

Inventing the Future of Neurology based on the authors' groundbreaking research, this book presents a research ideology, a novel multi-paradigm methodology, and advanced computational models for the automated EEG-based diagnosis of neurological disorders. It is based on the ingenious integration of three different computing technologies and problem-solving paradigms: neural networks, wavelets, and chaos theory. The book also includes three introductory chapters that familiarize the readers with these three distinct paradigms. After extensive research and the discovery of relevant mathematical.

Maternal gestational thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse neuropsychological development in children. This study investigated the effects of maternal thyroid dysfunction in early pregnancy and/or antibodies on the thyroid function and antibody status of children, as well as their association with the offspring's ADHD symptoms, scholastic performance and sensory development.The study population consisted of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1986. The mothers' TSH, fT4 and TPO-Ab concentrations were evaluated in early pregnancy and in their offspring at 16 years of age. Data on the mothers and their families, their child's health, development, behavior and scholastic performance were collected via parental questionnaires conducted in early pregnancy and when the children were 7-8 and 16 years old. Their teachers evaluated the children's behavior and scholastic performance at 8 years of age, and at 16 years old the adolescents evaluated themselves. Maternal gestational thyroid dysfunction associated with adolescents' increased odds of having the same thyroid dysfunction type. Adolescents of TPO-Ab-positive mothers had increased odds of being TPO-Ab-positive themselves. TPO-Ab-positive children had increased odds of having thyroid dysfunction. Increasing maternal TSH concentrations increased a child's odds of having ADHD symptoms (OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.1-1.8]). Children of hypothyroxinemic mothers had increased odds of repeating a class at school (OR 3.5 [1.1-11.5]), and those of hyperthyroid mothers had increased odds of Finnish language learning difficulties (1.6 [1.03-2.4]). Furthermore, thyroid dysfunction in adolescents increased their odds of learning difficulties. No association was observed between maternal thyroid dysfunction and a child's diagnosed intellectual deficiency and sensory development. Maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy associated with thyroid dysfunction in the offspring. Maternal thyroid dysfunction may have a mild impact on her offspring's neuropsychological development, but it had no effect on a child's risk of diagnosed intellectual deficiency or sensory development. Children have compensatory mechanisms for overcoming early developmental thyroid hormone insufficiencies. Randomized trials for screening and treating maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy are needed to evaluate the benefits to offspring.
