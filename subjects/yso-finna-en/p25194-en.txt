The falling sky : words of a Yanomami shaman
The Internet has become embedded into our daily lives, no longer an esoteric phenomenon, but instead an unremarkable way of carrying out our interactions with one another. Online and offline are interwoven in everyday experience. Using the internet has become accepted as a way of being present in the world, rather than a means of accessing some discrete virtual domain. Ethnographers of these contemporary internet-infused societies consequently find themselves facing serious methodological dilemmas: where should they go, what should they do there and how can they acquire robust knowledge about what people do in, through and with the internet? This book presents an overview of the challenges faced by ethnographers who wish to understand activities that involve the internet. Suitable for both new and experienced ethnographers, it explores both methodological principles and practical strategies for coming to terms with the definition of field sites, the connections between online and offline and the changing nature of embodied experience. Examples are drawn from a wide range of settings, including ethnographies of scientific institutions, television and social media, and locally-based gift-giving networks.

Evocative autoethnography : writing lives and telling stories
"This comprehensive text is the first to introduce evocative autoethnography as a methodology and a way of life in the human sciences. Using numerous examples from their work and others, world-renowned scholars Arthur Bochner and Carolyn Ellis, originators of the method, emphasize how to connect intellectually and emotionally to the lives of readers throughout the challenging process of representing lived experiences. Written as the story of a fictional workshop, based on many similar sessions led by the authors, it incorporates group discussions, common questions, and workshop handouts. The book -describes the history, development, and purposes of evocative storytelling; -provides detailed instruction on becoming a story-writer and living a writing life; -examines fundamental ethical issues, dilemmas, and responsibilities; -illustrates ways ethnography intersects with autoethnography; -calls attention to how truth and memory figure into the works and lives of evocative autoethnographers"--

Narrating social work through autoethnography
"Challenging the critique of autoethnography as overly focused on the self, Tami Spry calls for a performative autoethnography that both unsettles the "I" and represents the Other with equal commitment. Expanding on her popular book Body, Paper, Stage, Spry uses a variety of examples, literary forms, and theoretical traditions to reframe this research method as transgressive, liberatory, and decolonizing for both self and Other. Her book  - draws on her own autoethnographic work with jazz musicians, shamans, and other groups; - outlines a utopian performative methodology to spur hope and transformation; - provides concrete guidance on how to implement this innovative methodological approach"--
