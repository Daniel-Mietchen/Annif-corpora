CATALOGCREATOR® became available in PLM Group's product portfolio at the beginning of the year 2012, which makes it a completely new product for all employees. There was a certain need to gather all relevant information in one place to help sales managers to find the main aspects rapidly during their customer visits. The Marketing crew can also find the manual useful when introducing the product via telephone and facing questions. Information was mainly gathered on the Internet. Numbers and tables were given by the main company via email. As a result, a handbook of nearly 30 pages was built. The handbook includes all relevant data such as common features, market share, pricing and competitors.

SolidWorks® 2010 : no experience requiredTM
The purpose of this thesis was to develop and intensify the design procedures in Paroc Oy Ab. The goal was to study different methods and harmonize ways of conducting design work. There was a great need for this because in addition to Paroc's own designers, the services of consulting designers from outside of the company were also used. Between companies there are major differences in using certain procedures and when designers are used from outside of the company the design work has to be harmonized so that manufacturing and maintenance would be more efficient. The emphasis in this thesis is on SolidWorks design and helpful tools such as the PDM that are used in the SolidWorks environment. The goal was to create standardized solutions for platforms, stairs, guard-rails, duct accessories and safety nets. The interpretation of technical standards has a great role in creating standardized parts. The possibilities of more efficient component use and the file archive system were studied to make the procedures as efficient as possible for the design work. Fast development of technical solutions and software to be considered when analyzing the results of this thesis as the conclusions may not be valid in the future.
