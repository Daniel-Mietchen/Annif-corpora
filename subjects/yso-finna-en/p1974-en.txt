The main objective of this thesis is to provide combustion study by optical methods in Wärtsilä 34 size gas engines. To enable this study method, a optical cylinder assembly had to be designed. This means designing an optical access to the combustion chamber. This optical access has to be designed in a way that it endures the stresses directed to it during the measurements and it has to enable passive and active measurement methods. In a practise it means that the access has to be really big or that there is multiple accesses. Measurement techniques were not studied in this thesis. Studying combustion with optical methods enables measuring and analysing the combustion happening in a way that other measurement techniques do not enable. Measurement results help to understand better the combustion and to develop the gas engine efficiency and make it more environment friendly. This optical cylinder assembly were studied and optimized with computer simulation. The cylinder assembly that provides optical access to combustion chamber of gas engine endures the stresses that are directed to it based on the computer simulations. Thus it means that with this optical cylinder assembly it is possible to study combustion.

Combustion fundamentals
"Combustion involves change in the chemical state of a substance from a fuel-state to a product-state via chemical reaction accompanied by release of heat energy. Design or performance evaluation of equipment also requires knowledge of the RATE of change of state. This rate is governed by the laws of thermodynamics and by the empirical sciences of heat and mass transfer, chemical kinetics and fluid dynamics. Theoretical treatment of combustion requires integrated knowledge of these subjects and strong mathematical and numerical skills.ANALYTIC COMBUSTION is written for advanced undergraduates, graduate students and professionals in mechanical, aeronautical, and chemical engineering. Topics were carefully selected and presented to facilitate learning with emphasis on effective mathematical formulations and solution strategies. The book features over 60 solved numerical problems and analytical derivations and nearly 145 endof- chapter exercise problems. The presentation is gradual starting from Thermodynamics of Pure and Mixture substances, Chemical Equilibrium, building to a uniquely strong chapter on Application Case-Studies"--
