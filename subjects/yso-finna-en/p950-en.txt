"Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer, 6th Edition" provides a unified treatment of momentum transfer (fluid mechanics), heat transfer and mass transfer. The new edition has been updated to include more modern examples, problems, and illustrations with real world applications. The treatment of the three areas of transport phenomena is done sequentially. The subjects of momentum, heat, and mass transfer are introduced, in that order, and appropriate analysis tools are developed.
