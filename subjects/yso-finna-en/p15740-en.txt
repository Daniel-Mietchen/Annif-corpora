Growth limitation of trees and carbon balance of the vegetation in the treeline zone in north eastern Lapland
Summary: Luzula arcuata belongs to the subgenus Gymnodes, which is the largest of the genus Luzula. The form confusa is sometimes distinguished as a separate subspecies, while other workers consider it an independent species...

Twenty lichens are reported as new to Finland from Mt. Saana and Mt.Malla in NWFinland: Caloplaca approximata, Caloplaca exsecuta, Eiglera flavida, Frigidopyrenia bryospila, Hymenelia melanocarpa, Hymenelia prevostii, Hymenelia rhodopis, Ionaspis ceracea, Lecanora torrida, Staurothele hymenogonia, Strigula muscicola, Thelidium decussatum*, Thelidium submethorium, Verrucaria cinereorufa, Verrucaria disjuncta*, Verrucaria papillosa, Verrucaria pinguicula*, Verrucaria subfuscata, Verrucaria subjunctiva* and Verrucaria tenebrica. The six species marked with an asterisk are also new to Fennoscandia. Additional 24 species are new to the biogeographical province Enontekiö Lapland (EnL). The Finnish records of Thelidiumpyrenophorum are corrected to represent T. auruntii. Most of the species new to Finland were found on calcareous rocks (dolomite), but twowere collected on calcareous soils and three on schistose rocks..
