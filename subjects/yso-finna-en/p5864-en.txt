The compensatory effect of environmental subsidies for agri-environmental output constraints was evaluated through a comparative analysis observing the 'pure' efficiency, as a benchmark for prevailing production conditions, and the 'compensated' efficiency, as a proxy indicator of the compensation. An unbalanced data panel covering 3578 Swedish dairy farms in the period 2002-2012 was used. The analysis showed that in the study period, environmental farm support decreased the differences in farm revenue generated by agri-environmental output constraints in Sweden. However, the environmental support distribution did not succeed in meeting regional needs, so difficulties in farmers' ability to generate output in southern and central forest and valley areas of Sweden were visible. Furthermore, the environmental agricultural support had only a partial subsidisation effect on 'green' farm management practices, with full compensation being achieved for organic and capital-extensive farming, whereas low livestock density farming was not sufficiently compensated. This analysis reveals incentives with policy implications for farm economic performance and provides direct input to future policy recommendations for environmental support allocation.

Managing and measuring employee performance
Bossy and autocratic superiors. Non-managers - lax, lazy or unassertive in their work. Difficult personalities, piggy-backers, bullies and avengers - the styles of work behavior are many. Neglect of client needs, maltreatment and maximisation of personal benefit. Unresolved conflicts. The problems are prevalent and familiar. Why is nothing done about them? The answer is the Evil Eleven Syndrome. The book describes the dark side of workplaces, weakening both wellbeing and performance. The theoretical frame of reference is the X Efficiency theory of organisational economics. With the help of this innovative theory it is possible to explain, conceptualise and understand phenomena that traditional economic theory does not address. The book examines organisational inefficiency from the perspective of human decision-making, work behaviour and pressures. The individual level is important, because organisational performance is based on the productivity of work.
