This publication is about the kinds of ethically challenging situations and ethical  dilemmas faced by health and social professionals of all levels who provide care for people with dementia in care homes and hospital settings. It contains short stories based on typical situations which professional carers might encounter, along with exercises and appendices to encourage and facilitate ethical reflection, structured  guidance on how to tackle ethically challenging situations and commentaries from experts in the field of ethics as well as professional care. The publication should ideally be used in the context of professional care training (e.g. with moderated group discussions, professional guidance and role playing) and adapted to the different levels of education and experience of the readers. It doesn't provide ready-made answers but hopefully, in the context of ongoing professional training, it will contribute towards empowering and motivating health and social care professionals to provide ethical care, and tackling ethically challenging situations with more confidence, thereby contributing to the wellbeing of their clients, colleagues and themselves.

The Common Sense Guide to Dementia for Clinicians and Caregivers provides an easy-to-read, practical, and thoughtful approach to dementia care. Written by two specialists who have cared for thousands of patients with dementia and their families, this ground-breaking title unifies the perspectives of neurology and psychiatry to meet a variety of caregiver needs. It spotlights many real-world concerns not typically covered in standard textbooks, while simultaneously presenting a more detailed medical perspective than typical caregiver manuals. This handy title offers expert guidance for the clinical management of dementia and compassionate support of patients and families. Designed to enhance the physician-caregiver interaction and liberally illustrated with case examples, The Common Sense Guide espouses general principles of dementia care that apply across the stages and spectrum of this illness, including non-Alzheimer's types of dementia, in addition to Alzheimer's disease. Clinicians, family members, and other caregivers will find this volume useful from the moment that symptoms of dementia emerge. The authors place an emphasis on caring for the caregiver as well as the patient. Essential topics include how to find the right clinician, make the most of a doctor's visit, and avert a crisis - or manage one that can't be avoided. Sometimes difficult considerations, such as driving, financial management, legal matters, long-term placement, and end-of-life care, are faced head-on. Tried, true, and time-saving tips are explained in terms of what works - and what doesn't - with regard to clinical evaluation, medications, behavioral measures, and alternate therapies. Medical, nursing, and allied health care professionals will undoubtedly turn to this unique overview as a vital resource and mainstay of clinical dementia care, as well as a valuable recommendation for family caregivers.
In the diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders, the use of neuroimaging has expanded widely and has been an exciting, important modality for unlocking the causes of abnormal motor control. With ever improving machinery, data collection techniques and analysis methods, researchers are now being presented with an exponentially increasing amount of data that they must wade through and interpret in the context of existing knowledge about movement disorders. In Neuroimaging in Movement Disorders, the editors have produced a gold-standard resource that brings together an impressive internatio.

Neuropsychology and the dementias
Inflammatory diseases of the CNS are playing an increasingly important role in the clinical practice of neuroradiology. Neuroimaging contributes greatly to the differentiation of infectious (e.g., viral encephalitis and pyogenic brain abscess) and noninfectious (e.g., multiple sclerosis) inflammatory brain diseases and to the distinction between brain inflammation and other brain diseases, e.g., neoplastic or ischemic. This second, updated edition of Inflammatory Diseases of the Brain provides a comprehensive overview of the field from a neuroradiological point of view. In order to ensure a standardized approach throughout the book, each disease-oriented chapter is again subdivided into three principal sections: epidemiology, clinical presentation, and therapy; imaging; and differential diagnosis. A separate chapter addresses technical and methodological issues and imaging protocols. An important focus of the book is the current role of advanced MR imaging techniques, such as diffusion and perfusion MRI and MR spectroscopy, in the differentiation of inflammatory and other brain diseases. All of the authors are recognized experts, and the numerous high-quality and informative illustrations include some not contained in the first edition. This book will be of great value not only to neuroradiologists but also to neurologists, neuropediatricians, and general radiologists.

Updated and expanded with nine additional chapters, Movement Disorder Emergencies: Diagnosis and Treatment, Second Edition is an indispensable resource for general neurologists, specialists, fellows, and residents eager to improve their approach toward the patient with a movement disorder emergency. In this comprehensive second edition, prominent neurologists from around the world logically and systematically review the major movement disorder emergencies, instructing the reader on how optimally to recognize and manage these problems. The authors cover a broad range of disorders, including acute dystonic reactions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, startle syndromes, tic emergencies, and others; and they stress the importance of certain obvious diagnoses such as Wilson's disease, dopa-responsive dystonia, and Whipple's disease, in which delayed diagnosis in less emergent situations can lead to slowly evolving and often irreversible neurologic damage with tragic consequences. In addition, nine topics not covered in the first edition are provided, including genetic counseling and testing crises, suicide risk, psychogenic movement disorders, and others. Patient vignettes at the beginning of each chapter focus the reader's attention and highlight the urgency of the problem. Since astute clinical diagnosis of many movement disorders is still largely dependent on visual pattern recognition in the clinic, an accompanying online collection of physician-patient vignettes illustrates virtually all of the movement disorders described in the text. Importantly, the authors also discuss a range of new treatment paradigms that have emerged since publication of the first edition, especially deep brain stimulation. Authoritative and a leading text in the field, Movement Disorder Emergencies: Diagnosis and Treatment, Second Edition is an established, practical reference that continues to achieve excellence in the field of diagnosis and management of movement disorder emergencies.
A call for cross-cultural research to explore the behavioral consequences of vascular factors affecting the brain : the pathophysiology and prevention of vascular dementia
Parkinson's disease and nonmotor dysfunction
Progressive multiple sclerosis places a huge burden on individuals, carers and society and treatment options are currently limited. However, there have been significant recent advances in understanding progressive disease and this book draws the field together into a single, accessible, clinically focused text. Progressive Multiple Sclerosis sets out the basic science, pathology, epidemiology and treatment possibilities in progressive multiple sclerosis. The biological processes underlying disease progression are elucidated as are specific pathophysiological mechanisms. The basic science of axonal degeneration and the clinical understanding of progressive multiple sclerosis are discussed in the context of emerging and future therapies for disease progression as are trials which might be conducted for progressive multiple sclerosis. An overview of biomarkers for the disease is included and existing symptomatic therapies for progressive multiple sclerosis are covered in detail. Each chapter addresses specific aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis providing an extensive review of the current literature and a discussion of the likely mechanisms of tissue injury relevant to the disease. Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is ideal for both general neurologists and those with a specialist interest in multiple sclerosis. It will also be of interest to neurologists in training and other medical professionals treating this common disease. Dr Alastair Wilkins is Senior Lecturer in Neurology, University of Bristol, and Consultant Neurologist at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, UK. He researches axonal injury in multiple sclerosis and related disorders.

The first edition of Parkinson's Disease and Nonmotor Dysfunction was published in 2005 to provide a source of detailed information that could be readily accessed by the practicing physician. The widely praised first edition described and explained these nonmotor features that had at that point received insufficient attention both in the medical and in the lay literature. Since the publication of the first edition, awareness and knowledge of the nonmotor features of PD has dramatically expanded, calling for a new edition of this important title. Timely, fully updated and expanded, Parkinson's Disease and Nonmotor Dysfunction, Second Edition, offers a state-of-the-art overview of the topic from the same talented group of experienced researchers and clinicians who were the driving force behind the first edition. Importantly, a range of additional aspects of nonmotor dysfunction in PD -- such as dermatological, vestibular, and dental dysfunction -- have been included in this second edition, which remains subdivided into five diverse domains: Behavioral abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, sleep-related dysfunction, sensory dysfunction, and other aspects of PD such as oculomotor dysfunction, fatigue, and maxillofacial issues. An invaluable contribution to the literature in movement disorders, this revised and expanded collection of contributions by an even larger contingent of superbly knowledgeable authors will further increase awareness of the manifold contributions that nonmotor features may make to the collective clinical picture experienced by the patient with PD.
