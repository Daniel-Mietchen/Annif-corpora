The improvement of urban schools is one of the major challenges facing practitioners and policy-makers today. Issues related to poverty create particular difficulties in urban schools, and the emphasis on market-led improvement strategies has tended to add to these challenges. In addition, strategies for 'raising standards', as measured by aggregate test and examination results, can result in marginalisation or exclusion of some groups of learners. Drawing on research evidence, "Improving Urban Schools" addresses the question of how primary and secondary urban schools can be improved in a more inclusive way. The authors argue that urban schools and their communities have within them expertise that tends to be overlooked, and latent creativity that should be mobilised to move thinking and progress forward. They show that new approaches to leadership, various forms of collaborative school-to-school partnerships, and major changes in national policy development are needed to make use of this untapped energy. The book includes vivid accounts of these activities to shed light on what really happens in urban schools, and presents practical strategies for school leaders and practitioners who want to make a difference in urban schools.

Improving school leadership. Vol. 1, Policy and practice
Practicing the Art of Leadership by Reginald Leon Green presents success-proven practices, processes, and procedures grounded in time-tested theories, current research, and the creative, innovative, real-life experiences of educators in the field who are transforming underperforming schools into thriving educational learning communities. An invaluable guide to what today's educators need to know, how they need to do it, and the ways they should behave as exemplary leaders, the book takes into account the many changes in the standards, competencies, and accountability movements that have ushered in a new set of demands, requirements, and expectations for today's educational leaders. Complete coverage of the new topics, methods, and techniques effective educational leaders are using to address these changes appear throughout the text and are aligned with the 2015 Professional Standards for Educational Leaders, formerly known as ISLLC Standards. This new edition features opportunities for reflective practice through the use of scenarios depicting actual school issues, occurrences, and the behavior of practicing school leaders to help readers acquire knowledge and skills that can be used to build a solid framework for their own practice. The book's focus on how to use the new 2015 Professional Standards for Educational Leaders helps educators develop teacher capacity, create professional learning communities, effectively manage organizational resources, construct appropriate organizational policies and systems, lead instructional change, and engage in other deep and meaningful work outside of the classroom and in the community. The Enhanced Pearson eText features embedded videos and assessments.
