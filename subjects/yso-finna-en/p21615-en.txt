This is a close examination of the lives of marginalised young people in schools. Essays by scholars and educators are complemented by youth poetry, prose, and visual art. The book includes insights from Australia, United Kingdom, Polynesia, United States, and Canada and is grounded in educational and community practice and policy. The content covers the range and intersections of marginalisation: poverty, Aboriginal cultures, immigrants and newcomers, gay/lesbian youth, rural-urban divides, mental health, and so forth. Presenting challenges faced by marginalised youth alongside initiatives for mitigating their impact, the contributors critique existing systems and engage in a dialogue about where to go from here.

The capability approach acknowledges the role of institutions in limiting the capabilities of individuals, but does not analyse the institutional mechanisms involved. The institutional approach that is proposed ascribes a crucial role to knowledge and learning for two reasons: one, learning is essential for understanding the capability context of individuals; and, two, it is part of the process of overcoming restrictive institutions. This book argues that the capability approach can be strengthened by explicitly incorporating institutions.
Resistance to exercise : a social analysis of inactivity
"This book brings together a team of leading theorists to address the question 'What is the right measure of justice?' Some contributors, following Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, argue that we should focus on capabilities, or what people are able to do and to be. Others, following John Rawls, argue for focussing on social primary goods, the goods which society produces and which people can use. Still others see both views as incomplete and complementary to one another. Their essays evaluate the two approaches in the light of particular issues of social justice - education, health policy, disability, children, gender justice - and the volume concludes with an essay by Amartya Sen, who originated the capabilities approach"--Provided by publisher.
