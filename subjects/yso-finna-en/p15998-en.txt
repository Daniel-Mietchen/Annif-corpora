"In 2011, MOOCs dominated media reports on higher education and, since then, hundreds of organizations have rushed to produce and offer these courses. Why are institutions offering MOOCs and what are they achieving as a result? This book addresses these questions based on interviews with almost 100 policymakers and businesspeople. The authors identify six major goals for MOOC production and, using real-life examples, assess whether these goals are being achieved and, if not, how they could be accomplished going forward"--Back cover
