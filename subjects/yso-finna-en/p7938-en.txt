Tiivistelmä: The goal of this final year project was visualizing the Master ́ s Degree research in Change Management done by Remco Meisner and Roelof van Cleef at the VU University Amsterdam. The main goal of the project was to use a model called MINCE which is meant for evaluating the maturity level of organizations and to suggest ways to achieve a desired state.    A short film was created. The target group consisted of students of the change management department at the VU University Amsterdam and the staff of three organizations participating in the study.    The official premier of the film took place during the Master Dissertation presentation at the VU University Amsterdam. It was also shown in Andarr, an independent company based in Utrecht with more than sixty consultants in the field of ICT and management, (comma) in which Remco Meisner worked as a consultant at the time. The film can also be watched on YouTube and on the MINCE foundation website.    There might be need for continuation, since interest in studies in change management and in the MINCE model in particular is growing. The film can be developed further with voice over or subtitles in different languages.

Heritage is everywhere, and an understanding of our past is increasingly critical to the understanding of our contemporary cultural context and place in global society. Visual Heritage in the Digital Age presents the state-of-the-art in the application of digital technologies to heritage studies, with the chapters collectively demonstrating the ways in which current developments are liberating the study, conservation and management of the past. Digital approaches to heritage have developed significantly over recent decades in terms of both the quantity and range of applications. However, rather than merely improving and enriching the ways in which we understand and engage with the past, this technology is enabling us to do this in entirely new ways. The chapters contained within this volume present a broad range of technologies for capturing data (such as high-definition laser scanning survey and geophysical survey), modelling (including GIS, data fusion, agent-based modelling), and engaging with heritage through novel digital interfaces (mobile technologies and the use of multi-touch interfaces in public spaces). The case studies presented include sites, landscapes and buildings from across Europe, North and Central America, and collections relating to the ancient civilisations of the Middle East and North Africa. The chronological span is immense, extending from the end of the last ice age through to the twentieth century. These case studies reveal new ways of approaching heritage using digital tools, whether from the perspective of interrogating historical textual data, or through the applications of complexity theory and the modelling of agents and behaviours. Beyond the data itself, Visual Heritage in the Digital Age also presents fresh ways of thinking about digital heritage. It explores more theoretical perspectives concerning the role of digital data and the challenges that are presented in terms of its management and preservation.

The process of developing models, known as modeling, allows scientists to visualize difficult concepts, explain complex phenomena and clarify intricate theories. In recent years, science educators have greatly increased their use of modeling in teaching, especially real-time dynamic modeling, which is central to a scientific investigation. Modeling in science teaching is being used in an array of fields, everything from primary sciences to tertiary chemistry to college physics, and it is sure to play an increasing role in the future of education. Models and Modeling: Cognitive Tools for Scientific Enquiry is a comprehensive introduction to the use of models and modeling in science education. It identifies and describes many different modeling tools and presents recent applications of modeling as a cognitive tool for scientific enquiry.

The goal of this book is to present a variety of methods used in multidimensional data visualization. The emphasis is placed on new research results and trends in this field, including optimization, artificial neural networks, combinations of algorithms, parallel computing, different proximity measures, nonlinear manifold learning, and more. Many of the applications presented allow us to discover the obvious advantages of visual data mining—it is much easier for a decision maker to detect or extract useful information from graphical representation of data than from raw numbers. The fundamental idea of visualization is to provide data in some visual form that lets humans understand them, gain insight into the data, draw conclusions, and directly influence the process of decision making. Visual data mining is a field where human participation is integrated in the data analysis process; it covers data visualization and graphical presentation of information.

Making data meaningful. Part 2, A guide to presenting statistics
Visualizations - either self-created or external visual stimuli used as an aid to learning - are probably as old as learning itself. Yet surprisingly little research has been done either into how precisely they help us learn, or how to produce ones that are effective pedagogical tools. This volume, a comprehensive review of theory and research on the use of visualization in mathematics, science and reading, contrasts the two dominant theoretical paradigms of how people construct and interpret visualizations. However, the authors never lose sight of practical applications, providing frequent, accessible synopses of research findings in addition to succinct summaries of how the research affects practice. Written by a team with decades of experience in research and practice in the three subjects, the chapters show how cognitive psychology can enhance practical pedagogy, place visualizations in their proper historical context, and analyze in detail the effectiveness of paper-, computer- and video-based visualizations, with some surprising results. The book is published at a time when, it seems, there is no limit to the art of creating visualizations, as powerful computers make graphics ever more colorful and realistic and 'interactivity' is firmly established as a buzzword in the educational lexicon. The aim of the volume is to explore some central questions in the field, including how to evaluate visualizations and whether or not they can act as an aid to reading development, and to mathematics and science learning. The authors also point to potentially fruitful subjects for future research, and offer their own conclusions and recommendations.
