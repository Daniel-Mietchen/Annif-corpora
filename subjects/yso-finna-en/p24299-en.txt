The thesis was carried out for a commission company Humap Ltd., which is a consulting company with thirteen years of experience in the field. Humap Ltd. uses systemic constructionism as its framework in leadership trainings.     The objective of the study was to research Humap Ltd.'s theoretical framework, systemic constructionism, and see the what the frameworks approach is to leadership. I wanted to find out if systemic constructionism as an approach is compatible to the hopes and wishes of Human Resource Managers and Development Managers in organizations that are customers of Humap Ltd. The thesis is an important reality background regarding Humap Ltd. if their thoughts about the future needs are valuable to their business and I was able to formulate recommendations for them based on the results.     The method applied in the empirical part of the research was qualitative. Three Human Resources Managers and one Development Manager were interviewed face to face; one Development Director was interviewed via telephone. The process of the compilation was originated in the beginning of January 2012 and finalized by the beginning of May 2012. All of the interviews conducted took part between February 7th and March 5th.     As the findings indicated that in fact systemic constructionism is a compatible framework to have in leadership trainings. There were several wishes that rose in the interview that go hand in hand with the systemic constructionist approach. Shortly it may be said that Human Resource Managers and Development Managers hope for whole system thinking, well-being at work, early support and giving competencies for a leader to act as a coach to the employee to be emphasized in future leadership trainings.

"This book uses Niklas Luhmann's systems theory to explore how the legal system operates as one of modern society's subsystems. The authors demonstrate how this theory alters our understanding of some of the most important and controversial issues within law: the nature of judicial communication and legal argument; the claim that it can be right to disobey law; the character of legal pluralism and globalisation; time and its construction within law; the significance of the rule of law and human rights and the role of appeals to, and within, law."--

Abstract.
Systems thinking, system dynamics : managing change and complexity
"Donors, leaders of nonprofits, and public policy makers usually have the best of intentions to serve society and improve social conditions. But often their solutions fall far short of what they want to accomplish and what is truly needed. Moreover, the answers they propose and fund often produce the opposite of what they want over time. We end up with temporary shelters that increase homelessness, drug busts that increase drug-related crime, or food aid that increases starvation. How do these unintended consequences come about and how can we avoid them? By applying conventional thinking to complex social problems, we often perpetuate the very problems we try so hard to solve, but it is possible to think differently, and get different results. Systems Thinking for Social Change enables readers to contribute more effectively to society by helping them understand what systems thinking is and why it is so important in their work. It also gives concrete guidance on how to incorporate systems thinking in problem solving, decision making, and strategic planning without becoming a technical expert. Systems thinking leader David Stroh walks readers through techniques he has used to help people end homelessness and increase affordable housing, improve public health, strengthen public education and access to early childhood development services, protect child welfare, reform the criminal justice system, resolve identity-based conflicts, and more. The result is a highly readable, effective guide to understanding systems and using that knowledge to get the results you want"--

Do we listen to earthworms? : tools for evaluating the Finnish Action Plan on the sustainable use of plant protection products
Decision makers in large scale interconnected network systems require simulation models for decision support. The behaviour of these systems is determined by many actors, situated in a dynamic, multi-actor, multi-objective and multi-level environment. How can such systems be modelled and how can the socio-technical complexity be captured? Agent-based modelling is a proven approach to handle this challenge.This book provides a practical introduction to agent-based modelling of socio-technical systems, based on a methodology that has been developed at Delft University of Technology and which has been deployed in a large number of case studies. The book consists of two parts: the first presents the background, theory and methodology as well as practical guidelines and procedures for building models. In the second part this theory is applied to a number of case studies, where for each model the development steps are presented extensively, preparing the reader for creating own models.
