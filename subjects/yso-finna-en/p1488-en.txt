Kids and branding in a digital world
Without design, the "brand identity" is just a name, sometimes paired with a statement that enumerates the values of the company. It is two-dimensional when written down or printed. The task for the retail designer is to turn that name or statement into a three-dimensional environment in which consumers may interact with the brand's product or services. Designing the Brand Identity in Retail Spaces is a casebook that shows and tells how architects and store designers have tackled that challenge. With nearly 300 examples from 48 renowned brands from around the world, this book examines every stage of a brand's "lifetime," from inception to show room. Cases run the retail gamut, including restaurants, department stores, and luxury brands. Each case is paired with analysis and interviews with brand managers and designers, guiding the reader through the entire design process. Easy to read and replete with stunning illustrations, this is the perfect primer for students and young professionals creating brand identities in their retail design.
