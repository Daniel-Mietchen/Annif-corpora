Type 1 diabetes is considered to be a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. Its prediction is currently based on diabetes-associated autoantibodies, giving a cumulative risk of 84% during 15 years of follow-up since seroconversion. Prediction of the timing of clinical onset has remained challenging, however. This thesis examines glucose metabolism in autoantibody-positive children with a high risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Out of a total of 14,876 children with an increased genetic risk followed up from birth in the Finnish DIPP study, 567 developed ≥2 autoantibodies during the follow-up and 255 of these (45%) were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes until the end of December 2011. The glucose parameters measured were HbA1c, OGTT and random plasma glucose with 3 to 12 months interval. Seven-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed on an age and sex-matched cohort. We showed that rising HbA1c, impaired glucose tolerance in OGTT, random plasma glucose values of ≥7.8mmol/l and potentially CGM can predict type 1 diabetes with a median time to diagnosis of approximately one year. Our results suggest that especially HbA1c and random plasma glucose are cost-effective and improve the prediction of diabetes. These markers may be useful for monitoring the response to treatment in prevention studies.

Optimization of yield and productivity in fed-batch fermentation
Enzymes are studied in different fields of biotechnology to reduce energy consumption, environmental effects and costs for the industry. Enzymes allow more effective production and better product quality than the use of chemical compounds. Enzymes are produced and studied in batch, continuous or fed-batch fermentations. This study concentrates on fed-batch fermentation. The focus is on the production of enzymes for the pulp and paper industry and optimization of the yield and productivity of fed-batch fermentation. The enzymes examined in this study were produced intracellularly by bacterial cells. The optimization of the yield and productivity were examined with the use of different feed profiles to see the growth trends of bacterial cells and how they produce the desired enzymes in the presence of different concentrations of glucose. Optical density, enzyme activity, glucose and lactate were measured from the fermentations to get the results for yield and productivity. The optimal yield and productivity is achieved by finding a glucose feed rate which gives the best possible balance for cell growth and product formation. Based on the yield and productivity results, the fed-batch fermentation can be improved and stabilized. This study deals with enzymes in the pulp and paper industry, the differences between the fermentation types mentioned above, the fermentation procedure and sampling, as well as experiments with the feed profiles and the analyses, errors and results.

Oxidative stress and inflammation underpin most diseases; their mechanisms are inextricably linked. For example, chronic inflammation is associated with oxidation, anti-inflammatory cascades are linked to decreased oxidation, increased oxidative stress triggers inflammation, and redox balance inhibits the inflammatory cellular response. Whether or not oxidative stress and inflammation represent the causes or the consequences of cellular pathology, they contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of non-communicable diseases. The incidence of obesity and other related metabolic disturbances are rising, as are age-related diseases due to progressively aging populations. Interrelations between the mechanisms of oxidative stress and of inflammatory signaling and metabolism are, in the broad sense of energy transformation, being increasingly recognized as part of the problem in non-communicable diseases. The book Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Non-communicable Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms and Perspectives in Therapeutics is an update on the latest research on the molecular basis of non-communicable diseases and the search for possible therapeutic alternatives. The authors of this monograph are experts in their field, and the book as a whole, provides an overview of the biochemical alterations underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, renal disease, neurological diseases and diabetes, emphasizing those aspects that they share in common. We hope that this book will be useful for researchers in biomedicine, and also for physicians interested in finding the root causes of the disease, as well as for post-graduate students in biochemistry, molecular biology, nutrition or medicine.
