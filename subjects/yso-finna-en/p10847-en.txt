Morgan's first-person account of her own struggles with anxiety was published as part of 'The Vice Guide to Mental Health' and was read by five million people across fifteen countries within four days. Anxiety for Beginners will serve as a guide for those who live with anxiety and those who live with it by proxy. Combining her own experiences (rendered in emotive detail) with extensive research with experts (neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists and fellow sufferers - many of them very familiar faces), Morgan will discover that the way in which people create a life is not just manageable but enjoyable, learning to accept anxiety rather than spend a life fighting and being ashamed of it.
