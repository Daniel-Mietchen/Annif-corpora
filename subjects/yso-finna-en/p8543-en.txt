Consultancy Skills for Mission and Ministry provides a readable handbook to doing consultancy in church based organisations. Many of those who exercise ministry in churches move into roles where they are expected to supervise and support ministers and church leaders in their work. Consultancy is an effective way of doing this and provides skills and theoretical frameworks for both those working explicitly as consultants to ministers and church workers and leaders as well as for officers in churches such as Archdeacons, Superintendents, Mission Officers, local church and regional development advisers or those involved in continuing professional development. Often people moving into these roles are not provided with the specific skills and knowledge they need. Other groups who will find this book useful will include consultants who operate in commercial, public and voluntary organisations but who need to know how to apply their skills in church settings and students on courses in consultancy.

Getting a job requires many things: hard skills, soft skills, the right attitude and motivation. To develop the degree programme in Business Information Systems in Oulu university of Applied Sciences (Oulu UAS), three surveys were conducted, to study importance of skills and knowledge in professional life: a graduate career survey in 2013, an employer survey in 2014, and a student survey in 2015. According to the results, readiness for change, learning skills and basic ICT skills seem to be the most important skills. To succeed at work, an adequate basis of hard skills, soft interpersonal and communication skills are needed. Also problem solving and pressure endurance seem to be very important.

One out of every eight people between the ages of 18 and 67 in the United States has a hearing loss, estimated as 12 percent of the working-age population. Sound Sense: Living and Learning with Hearing Loss addresses the acute need of these people to function at the highest level in these income-earning years, the longest phase in their lives. In nine pointed chapters, author Sara Laufer Batinovich, who also has lost her hearing, shares her experience and knowledge in turning every challenge into an opportunity to become ones best self-advocate. Batinovich begins in the workplace, advising on winning a job, keeping it, and developing a long-term career, plus how to reduce stress and establish fulfilling professional relationships with colleagues. She offers tips on communication ranging from having sales people face you for easier speechreading to parsing boarding announcements at airports and play-by-play at ballparks. Her practical handbook also provides step-by-step guidance for getting a hearing aid or a cochlear implant and finding ones way through prickly insurance claim mazes. Sound Sense features information on finding a service dog, securing legally mandated accommodations for continuing education, tips on exercise and health, and even sensitive suggestions on strengthening personal relationships. Batinovichs vivacious style and her own anecdotes add an upbeat, genuine sensibility to her books value as a positive guide to living with hearing loss.
Teambuilder : How to be a better
This thesis is made as a case study for an Oulu based indoor activity park. The case company also organizes work welfare activity services for business customers. The objective of this thesis is to determine what kind of work well-being activities companies in Oulu region organizes. Another objective is to find out what are the key issues the case company needs to pay attention to in order to be able to provide attractive services for companies. It was also wanted to examine companies expectations towards the benefits that can be achieved by organizing work welfare activity days. Work welfare is the competitive tool which creates financial performance. Work well-being must be considered from the perspective of profitability of the business so that its effects can be utilized in the best possible way. In this thesis the work welfares impacts on competitiveness were examined through three main players: productivity and cost-efficiency, quality of work and customer satisfaction, and intangible assets. .Another part of the theory consist of the factors affecting work well-being from the individual and organizational point of view. There has been used Rauramos five steps of work well-being- model examines the basic needs with respect of work. The research method used in this thesis is quantitative semi-structured research. It was conducted as a questionnaire which was sent to the respondents via e-mail. Smaller companies had bigger budgets and they organize more often work welfare activity days which last one day. The companies were interested in organizing work welfare activity days in the future as well as having new experiences. Comfortable environment was found out to be the most important factor when choosing a place where to organize work welfare days. The importance of evening program and wide range of options emerged. Companies believed that work welfare has an impact on the companys success. Relaxation, elevating team spirit and work motivation were found to be the key objectives. The company should focus on smaller companies since they have bigger budgets. Investing in websites is important since companies find information online. The work well-being activity days should have a variety of options to choose from since it occurred many times in the study. The opportunity for evening program was found to be important. The activities uplifting team spirit are worth investing in since it occurred many times in the study.

Abstract: Research indicates that organisations need to be more flexible, adaptive, entrepreneurial and innovative in order to effectively meet the changing demands of today's environment. On the other hand, it seems that higher level of job satisfaction is beneficial for companies to promote innovation climate and innovation activities. Therefore, job satisfaction appears to be tied to innovation, which is vital for the long-term success of the non-profit organisations. This study examines the potential relationships between job satisfaction facets, such as income, opportunities for advancement, relations with co-workers and supervisor, nature of work and job security, with technological and administrative innovations in the context of non-profit organisations. There were three stages to the research: formulating a conceptual model defining, based on literature, the concepts and relationships of job satisfaction, its facets and the two types of innovation; studying a non-profit organisation and identifying a way of measuring the afore-mentioned relationships; and testing the conceptual model utilising statistical theories. The employees of the case-study organisation completed a questionnaire measuring job satisfaction facets, technological and administrative innovations. The results indicated that facets that are favourable to administrative innovation differ from those that are conducive to technological innovation. In particular, satisfaction with income and the relations with co-workers are statistically significant predictors of administrative innovation, in a positive and a negative way respectively. Plus, satisfaction with the opportunities for advancement is a positive significant predictor of technological innovation. Complementing these results, an automatic model, which was built using IBM SPSS Statistics 21, designated the relation with co-workers and the manager and the satisfaction with the income and the nature of work as further important predictors of technological innovation and the opportunities for advancement and the job security as additional important predictors of administrative innovation.

Organizational behavior and management
Coaching for change
Job rotation has become an organizational tool used to widen an employee's perspective by enabling a person to switch between jobs. Yleisradio Oy took on job rotation in an organized way in the beginning of the year 2010. Due to financial cutbacks Yleisradio Oy is downsizing its operations and thus job rotation will become more necessary in the upcoming years. This thesis looks at managing know-how in job rotation with special emphasis on the manager's point of view on different aspects of the subject. This is meant for managers to help them react in situations of change which affect their departments as employees are coming to or leaving from their teams.  Job rotation is still in its early stages in organizations around the globe and thus there is not much research done on the subject. For this thesis primary research was conducted with in-depth interviews of nine managers in Yleisradio Oy. Job rotation influences not only the person taking part in the process but also their colleagues as well as their manager. Benefits of job rotation come to the employee taking part in job rotation, the department where they are leaving from, the department where they are going to as well as the organization as a whole. All these sectors which are influenced by job rotation have different needs and wants concerning the issue. These issues are handled in this thesis to provide insight into their relations with job rotation. Managers are the integral piece in the rotation process. They are the link between all the people affected by employees taking part in job rotation. Managers have to have good leadership skills to take into consideration the feelings of the employee coming to or leaving from their department as well as the rest of their subordinates as the change emerges. Managers also need to have good connections to the human resource department as well as to other managers to share thoughts and bounce ideas so that they have a good support system. This comes up especially when redefining concepts how to better manage the know-how which employees have as they switch jobs.

Abstract: The labor situation in Finland is facing challenges also in the area of health care. Healthcare organizations are seeking workforce abroad and the working environment is becoming international. Also Sastamala region's social and health services, Sotesi, is participating in a project, Case Espanja, bringing workforce from Spain to Finland.  The aim of this study was to analyze how Sotesi manages cultural diversity and how they could develop it. The objective of the study was to provide development ideas to how Sotesi could become a functional multicultural organization. The study was based on Taylor Cox Jr's change model on work on diversity.  This research was conducted with qualitative research methods, because the study aimed to understand the phenomena of organizational change and the human perspectives and behaviour behind it. A semi-structured interview was conducted. Five middle managers of Sastamala region's social and health services were interviewed about their perceptions of cultural diversity in the organization.  The results of the study show that even if many of the benefits of diversity are recognized Sotesi was not originally actively seeking diversity because of its benefits but because of the current labor situation. This has affected the attitudes of the employees. As the biggest benefits of diversity the middle managers identified richness in the work, different perspectives and ways to do work and increased overall tolerance within the organization. Insufficient language skills, intolerance for differences and finding mutual consensus were seen as the biggest challenges. The middle managers did not emphasize cultural diversity in their management as the ethos of nurse played bigger importance.  Even if Cox's model is based on American context it could be utilized also in a Finnish context. The study indicates that there has already been a change in Sotesi from a homogenous monolithic organization towards a heterogeneous plural organization. Sotesi has not yet reached the stage of multicultural organization and there are several development areas. The study provided development suggestions such as ensuring sufficient diversity training for everyone in the organization, also for the operational level in order to gain commitment to the change and a shift from awareness towards behavioural change and practical ideas for systematic measurement.

For professionals responsible for talent management and development, assessing competence and capability is crucial, especially in relation to recruiting the right leader. Yet talent professionals can also use leadership assessment as a positive and powerful talent development tool. Leadership Assessment for Talent Development goes beyond recruitment to position assessment as a central, strategic activity. It demonstrates how to apply a connected process that accelerates behavioural change areas and facilitates the engagement and enabling of in-house talent. This practical, forward-looking book uses authentic, engaging case studies to show how the principles of leadership assessment can work in practice. It is an essential companion for HR and talent professionals in any field who want to equip their company with the talent it needs to be fit for business success.

Abstract:.
This book analyses higher education from cultural perspectives and also to reflect on the uses of intellectual devices developed in the cultural studies of higher education over the last decades. The first part of the book presents fresh perspectives to integrate cultural studies in higher education with wider societal processes. Professor William G. Tierney speaks about trust and culture in higher education, whereas Professor Imanol Ordorika opens a political perspective to higher education institutions. The second part of the book studies the internal life of higher education. Relying on a variety of cultural perspectives, the chapters explore the actual day-to-day practices taking place in higher education, ranging from student socialisation, student consumerism, tensions in combining academic and market-oriented targets in knowledge production to the formation of academic identities in different disciplinary and organisational cultures. The focus in the third part of the book is to use cultural perspectives developed in previous studies on disciplinary and organisational cultures as a framework to understand a variety of processes and reforms taking place at the institutional level of high education. The chapters in this part of the book analyse the Bologna Process, the evolution of scientific fields in American universities, organisational cultures in Chinese post-merger universities, and doctoral education and cooperation with industry.

The book Managing Virtual Teams explores the critical elements that must be considered in managing virtual teams in organizations from structural, managerial, and process points-of-view. Based in solid research, the book provides a deep look at the nature of virtual teams and the factors that enable their success.Using a text-analysis method, the book consolidates results from both academic and practitioners' sources about virtual team inputs, processes, and outcomes. It lays out in clear detail the key characteristics of virtual teams and traces their emergence within organizations and research literature. Managing Virtual Teams addresses the particular practices of virtual teams, not only technological-focused but also socio-emotional, including the managerial attitudes required in virtual environments seeking well-performing teams. Incorporating case studies and research results, this book demonstrates how academic research can be used to successfully manage businesses in a virtual context.This book is a valuable contribution with clear guidelines for managerial practice, both for researchers interested in learning about virtual teams and to managers and organizations dealing with the challenges of managing them.
