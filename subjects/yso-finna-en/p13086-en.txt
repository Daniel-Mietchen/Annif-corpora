geothermal energy
"Focusing on renewable energy technologies, energy conversion, and conservation and the energy industry, this volume discusses energy applications in small-medium enterprises, solar energy, hydro and wind energy, nuclear energy, hybrid energy, and energy sustainability issues. The author lists the key aspects of applied energy and related studies, taking a question-based approach to the material that is useful for both undergraduate students and to postgraduates who want a broad overview of energy conversion. In addition to illustrations, the text contains numerous worked examples, case studies, and homework problems"--

"Heat provides the energy that drives almost all geological phenomena and sets the temperature at which these phenomena operate. This book explains the key physical principles of heat transport with simple physical arguments and scaling laws that allow quantitative evaluation of heat flux and cooling conditions in a variety of geological settings and systems. The thermal structure and evolution of magma reservoirs, the crust, the lithosphere and the mantle of the Earth are reviewed within the context of plate tectonics and mantle convection - illustrating how theoretical arguments can be combined with field and laboratory data to arrive at accurate interpretations of geological observations. Appendices contain data on the thermal properties of rocks, surface heat flux measurements and rates of radiogenic heat production. This book can be used for advanced courses in geophysics, geodynamics and magmatic processes, and is a reference for researchers in geoscience, environmental science, physics, engineering and fluid dynamics"--
In addition to renewable energy systems,  the Handbook also covers processes for  the effi cient and clean conversion of  traditional fuels such as coal, oil and gas,  energy storage systems, mitigation technologies  for the reduction of environmental  pollutants, and the development  of intelligent energy systems. Environmental,  social and economic impacts of  energy systems are also addressed in  depth.

More than 20 countries generate electricity from geothermal resources and about 60 countries make direct use of geothermal energy. A ten-fold increase in geothermal energy use is foreseeable at the current technology level. Geothermal Energy: An Alternative Resource for the 21st Century provides a readable and coherent account of all facets of geothermal energy development and summarizes the present day knowledge on geothermal resources, their exploration and exploitation. Accounts of geothermal resource models, various exploration techniques, drilling and production technology are discussed within 9 chapters, as well as important concepts and current technological developments. *Interdisciplinary approach, combining traditional disciplines such as geology, geophysics, and engineering *Provides a readable and coherent account of all facets of geothermal energy development *Describes the importance of bringing potable water to high-demand areas such as the tropical regions.

Mining the Earth's Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy describes the work carried out by the Los Alamos National Laboratory to turn an idealistic concept - that of drawing useful amounts of energy from the vast underground store of hot rock at reachable depths - into a practical reality. This book provides comprehensive documentation of the over two decades of experiments carried out at the test site at Fenton Hill, New Mexico, where the feasibility of accessing and extracting this vast natural resource was finally demonstrated. It also discusses the numerous technical, administrative, and financial hurdles that had to be overcome along the way. This publication will no doubt prove invaluable to researchers around the world as they strive to move this now-proven technology toward commercial viability. In addition, it is a valuable source of relevant information for anyone interested in the world energy outlook for the 21st century and beyond.

Geothermal energy : renewable energy and the environment
"As nations alike struggle to diversify and secure their power portfolios, geothermal energy, the essentially limitless heat emanating from the earth itself, is being harnessed at an unprecedented rate. For the last 25 years, engineers around the world tasked with taming this raw power have used Geothermal Reservoir Engineering as both a training manual and a professional reference. This long-awaited second edition of Geothermal Reservoir Engineering is a practical guide to the issues and tasks geothermal engineers encounter in the course of their daily jobs. The book focuses particularly on the evaluation of potential sites and provides detailed guidance on the field management of the power plants built on them. With over 100 pages of new material informed by the breakthroughs of the last 25 years, Geothermal Reservoir Engineering remains the only training tool and professional reference dedicated to advising both new and experienced geothermal reservoir engineers"--
