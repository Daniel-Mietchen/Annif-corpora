The pharmaceutical industry has faced many significant challenges since the early 1990s. The fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is how to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development. The current research and development (R&D) cost for developing a new therapeutic drug is greater than $800 million. Additionally, it takes an average of 12 years to get a new drug to market with an attrition rate greater than 90%. Reviewing the overall pharmaceutical R&D process, it has become clear that many of the drug failures are due to our lack of knowledge in population diversity, which is responsible for differences in drug efficacy and toxicity. In fact, not a single approved drug is 100% safe and efficacious for all patients. For researchers, the key question is: How can we discover biomarkers that can be used to distinguish patients who will respond to the drug without adverse effects from those who will not respond and/or will have adverse effects? There is tremendous urgency to address this question. Biomarkers also fit perfectly with the vision of personalized medicine, the new expectation of medical practice. This is why biomarker research has been a central focus in many research labs across academia, government agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. There are many different ways to define biomarkers based on molecular properties, applications, and methods.

Adequate oxygen supply is necessary for aerobic cell survival. Cellular oxygen deprivation, also known as hypoxia, leads to various responses that aim to increase cellular oxygen delivery and reduce oxygen consumption. Oxygen homeostasis is mainly regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which regulates the expression of over 300 genes in response to hypoxia. The stability of HIF is regulated by the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs), enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of proline residues in HIFα subunits and target them towards proteasomal degradation. HIF-P4Hs require oxygen as a cosubstrate for the reaction, allowing for hypoxic HIF stabilization and target gene induction at low oxygen concentrations.In this study we investigated the role of HIF-P4H-2 in the regulation of red blood cell production, erythropoiesis. We showed that Tibetans living at high altitude have genetically adapted to their hypoxic environment via mutations in the gene encoding for HIF-P4H-2. The Tibetan HIF-P4H-2 D4E,C127S variant showed enhanced hydroxylation of HIFα at low oxygen concentrations, resulting in reduced HIFα protein stabilization under hypoxia.In other studies we used a genetically modified HIF-P4H-2 hypomorphic mouse line which expresses a reduced amount of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA in tissues. We showed that these mice develop mild age-dependent erythrocytosis due to splenic extramedullary erythropoiesis, which is independent of serum erythropoietin concentration. In addition, these mice were protected against inflammation-induced anemia, a condition commonly seen in patients with inflammatory diseases. The HIF-P4H-2 hypomorphic mice also had altered basal metabolism in their skeletal muscles, which, together with an increase in mean capillary area, reduced their infarct size after skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury.These studies suggest that pharmacological HIF-P4H-2 inhibition may provide a novel treatment for EPO-resistant anemias and peripheral artery disease.

The Future of Drug Discovery: Who decides which diseases to treat? provides a timely and detailed look at the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry and how they relate, or should relate, to societal needs. The authors posit that as a result of increasing risk aversion and accelerated savings in research and development, the industry is not developing drugs for increasingly prevalent diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, untreatable pain, antibiotics and more. This book carefully exposes the gap between the medicines and therapies we need and the current business path. By analyzing the situation and discussing prospects for the next decade, the The Future of Drug Discovery is a timely book for all those who care about the development needs for drugs for disease. This thought-provoking book is the first to: provide an in-depth, broad perspective on the crisis in drug industry; expose the disconnect between what society needs and what the drug companies are working on; analyse and project over 10 years into the future; explain what it means for scientists and society; and determine what is needed to be done to make sure that the industry responds to society's needs, remains commercially attractive and answers the question as to who decides which diseases to treat.
