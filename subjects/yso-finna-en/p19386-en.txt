The Adlard Coles Book of Diesel Engines, previously published as The RYA Book of Diesel Engines, is aimed at boatowners rather than experienced mechanics. In clear jargon-free English it explains how a diesel engine works, and how to look after it, and takes into account new developments in engine technology. Based on the RYA's one-day Diesel Engine course, Tim Bartlett explains how the engine uses simple processes to convert fuel to power, and then looks at the various sub-systems that allow those processes to take place. He also takes a look at tools, winterizing and provides hints, tips and fault-finding tables.
