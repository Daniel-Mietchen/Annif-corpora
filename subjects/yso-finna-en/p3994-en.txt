Swearing in one form or another seems to be an important and readily accessible part of many of the world's languages. This study offers a definition of swearing shown to be applicable to a number of languages which differ both in terms of linguistic make-up and with regard to the religion and culture characterizing its speakers. Magnus Ljung highlights the differences and similarities in the swearing of more than twenty languages and relates them to aspects of current linguistic and pragmatic theory.
