The road to Woodstock
The town of Woodstock, New York, the original planned venue of the 1969 concert, is over 60 miles from the actual site. And Woodstock was a key location in the rock landscape even before Bob Dylan holed up there after his infamous 1966 motorcycle accident. Hoskyns re-creates Woodstock's community of brilliant dysfunctional musicians, scheming dealers, and opportunistic hippie capitalists drawn to the area by Dylan and his sidekicks from the Band.
