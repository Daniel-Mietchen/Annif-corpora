Music business is going through dramatic changes as Internet has evolved into more social and instant place. People demand a lot more from music and are more aware of what happens in the music industry. They want to get instant access to music and they are not willing to spend a lot of money on CDs. Also bands are more willing to try to succeed on their own without any help from record labels, because Internet and social media have made it easier for them. The change has also influenced strongly on record labels. Major record labels have started to loose their profit from CDs and many famous artists have left the majors and try to manage on their own. Finnish market is still dominated by major record labels which have put pressure on independent record labels to expand their operations abroad for better income. Many independent record labels have small financial resources and in order to expand to the foreign market they need to find cost effective ways to do that. Viral marketing via Internet is a very effective channel which doesn't require big budget. This thesis focus on a company HoneyBaby Records, and on the independent record labels in general. Methods of Internet marketing are investigated as they are essential for a record label which tries to generate profit and get awareness in an international market with a low budget. Opinions of regular consumers of music about music business and the meaning of record labels were inquired in order to find out a general conception about the state of music industry today. This thesis reveals that some good and effective ways for an independent record label to expand its operation into international market are using social media for creation of contacts, cooperation with foreign bars, clubs and studios and appealing to foreign bands and artist to get them to sign contracts.

Addi-tional aims included the strategies used in Internet-based marketing communications and the strengths and weaknesses of these communication tools. The study set out to answer the following three questions: What are the biggest challenges of marketing communication on the Internet? What are the most important Internet-based marketing communication methods?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the Internet as a marketing communications channel? The key concepts forming the basis for the digital economy, digital marketing and Internet-based marketing communications are reviewed. Qualitative research methods were employed, and interviews were used to collect the data. Four large- to middle-size travel related companies were included.

Social media branding provides the thinking, evidence, and practice to create a road map for practitioners in small businesses to develop and implement their brand in online and offline communities. It provides a start point because one of the biggest issues for small businesses is where to start. I have talked to so many business practitioners who don't like the idea of social media. Often, they say: "We can't do that because of the legal implications!" Or, "We will have to employ more people and we don't have the resources."

Abstract: The Analysis of Global Tourism Boards' Chinese Websites
This Bachelor's thesis project was conducted for DefShop GmbH. In accordance to the commissioner's interests towards customization of their e-mail newsletter service, a test campaign was administered in order to detect possible differences in the clicking behavior of male and female newsletter subscribers when receiving either neutral or humorous e-mails. The two test e-mails used for the campaign differed in their visual content, changing the message in either humorous or neutral direction. The click rates of both versions were examined in reference to the humor condition applied and the gender of the subject. The hypotheses were that male subscribers would react more strongly to the humorous e-mail version, whereas female subscribers would not be affected by the amount of humor in the newsletter. Data analysis was conducted through exploratory analysis, contingency tables with Chi-Square tests, and binary logistic regression model. Hypotheses about gender variations were evaluated based on the analysis results. The theoretical framework of the thesis consists of an overview of an analysis of the e-commerce field, online marketing, more specifically e-mail as a marketing channel, and humor in advertising context. Previous research results on the subject of observed gender-based differences in the effect of humorous advertisement, which found males to be more likely to react to humorous advertisement, while females were not affected by the humor condition, were used as a basis for the hypothesis formation.  The results of the research analysis were not entirely conclusive. Although the hypotheses were found to apply to the population at hand, no statistically inconclusive proof emerged that there would be significant interaction effect between humor and the gen-der. As a result, it could not be concluded that the observed differences between genders' click-rates were directly linked to the presence of humor. As the different statistical methods yielded partly incoherent results, no statement can be made that gender would be a determining factor of click-tendency in different humor condition groups. Further research points on the subject were suggested to the commissioner based on the analysis.
