The mask of benevolence : disabling the deaf community
Issues in deaf education
Louise Treadwell Tracy (1896-1983), the wife of film legend Spencer Tracy, takes center stage in this work. Providing background information on her life before her marriage in 1923, her own acting career in the theater, and the people who influenced her throughout her life, this work focuses on the profound effect the discovery that their son John, born in 1924, was deaf had on the Tracys. The years spent teaching him how to talk would inspire Louise to establish the John Tracy Clinic in 1942. Dedicated to bringing awareness to doctors, educators, parents and the public that preschool-age deaf children could learn to communicate orally, the clinic survived and flourished despite often devastating financial difficulties. As the years progressed, Mrs. Spencer Tracy emerged as a highly respected leader in the field of deaf education and a tireless ambassador for the hearing-challenged.

Deaf history and culture in Spain : a reader of primary documents
During the 1995 ICED papers on education of deaf and hard of hearing children in developing countries were presented within the general fifteen different issues around which the Congress was organized. For the purpose of the publication of the Proceedings, a special section was added which specifically deals with cross-cultural perspectives and international issues. .
Choices in Deafness, since 1987 the preeminent guide to communication options, is now extensively revised and expanded to provide the complete scope of information parents of children with deafness or hearing loss need. From assessment and diagnosis to medical/audiological treatments, and from the latest types of cochlear implants and procedures to education and technology devices, this new edition presents a balance of research, guidance, and insight from experts and families.Seven new chapters plus an audio CD cover: -Universal Newborn Screening (implemented in 38 states, this required screening detects hearing loss much earlier, and has doubled the number of children found to have hearing loss) Auditory Neuropathy (a cause of hearing loss where the timing of sound is seriously disrupted, and which has only recently been understood) -Genetic Causes of Deafness (describes genetic testing and counseling in light of research that shows over 60% of deafness in children is due to genetic or hereditary causes) -The Transformation of Dreams (explores a shift in emotional outlook experienced by a parent/clinical psychologist upon learning her child is deaf) -Identifying a Program of Excellence (what to look for in an education program for your child in addition to the chosen communication option) -Communication Technology (services and devices that let deaf people communicate via phone, cell phone, Internet,video) -Making It in College (personal accounts of four students about how they communicate and socialize at college) -What Hearing Loss Sounds Like (a seven-minute audio CD depicts what speech sounds like as it simulates how hearing loss can affect pitch, loudness, and timing) As in the previous edition, Choices in Deafness presents five unbiased approaches to communication--Auditory-Verbal, ASL-English Bilingual, Cued Speech, Auditory-Oral, and Total Communication--and provides parents' first-person accounts of what it's like to use a specific method. Reading and resource lists round out this essential guide for parents.
Linguistic turns in teaching of the deaf in Finland
The history of deaf people : a source book
The way in which education is provided for deaf children in both special settings and mainstream schools is changing, as are the demands made on teachers. Written by specialists, this book responds by providing a comprehensive, accessible and up-to-date account of recent research and current issues in educational policy, psychology, linguistics and audiology, as they relate to deaf education. It also provides detailed information about further reading. The book will appeal to student teachers and teachers of the deaf; teachers in mainstream schools; academics working in the area of deafness and disability; audiologists and cochlear implant teams; and parents of deaf children and members of the deaf community.
Lane argues that the relationship between the deaf community and those who claim to help them resembles that between colonized and colonizerm resulting in the suppression of the oppressed group's language and culture - in the dehumanization of the oppressed to the profit of the oppressor.He shows, for example, how the "medicalization" of culturel deafness does more for medical professionals and the manufacturers of prosthetic devices (hearing aids, "bionic ears") than for deaf children; how the "mainstreaming" of deaf children in hearing schools actually obstructs their education - aiding not the students but the interests of a various medical and rehabilitation specialists by putting a premium on their services.
Current trends in European sign language  research : Proceedings of the third European congress on sign language research. Hamburg july 26 - 29, 1989
In this landmark reader, Benjamin Fraser offers in five parts 44 Spanish documents dating from 1417 to the present, translated for the first time to trace the turbulent history of Deaf culture in Spain. Part I: The Birth of Oralism and Deafness as Metaphor illustrates the predominant impression of deafness as isolation, exemplified by Teresa de Cartagena writings in 1455-60 about deafness as an island. Part II: The Return to Deaf Education highlights writers who wished to restore the Spanish Art of educating deaf students. Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro wrote The Spanish School of Deafmutes, or Method of Teaching Them to Write and Speak the Spanish Language in 1795. Yet, Madrids Royal School for Deaf-Mutes, which opened in 1805, taught deaf students using methodical signs adopted from Frances Abbé de lEpée. Readings in Part III :The Contemporary Deaf Experience reveal considerations from the 1970s to the 90s of Deaf culture and linguistics similar to those in the United States, typified by the works of Inés Polo and Félix-Jesús Pinedo Peydró. The fourth part, The Recognition of Deaf Language and Culture, marks the expansion of academic research in Spain. María Angeles Rodríguez González spearheaded Spanish Sign Language (LSE) linguistics in 1992 with her publication Sign Language. The final part, A Selection of Deaf Poetry, concludes these documents with verse in Spanish spoken dialects rather than LSE, indicating that the evolution of the Deaf experience in Spain continues on its own path today.
