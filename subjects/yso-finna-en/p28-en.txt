Every great design has its beginnings in a great idea, whether your medium of choice is scenery, costume, lighting, sound, or projections. Unmasking Theatre Design shows you how to cultivate creative thinking skills through every step of theatre design - from the first play reading to the finished design presentation. This book reveals how creative designers think in order to create unique and appropriate works for individual productions, and will teach you how to comprehend the nature of the design task at hand, gather inspiration, generate potential ideas for a new design, and develop a finished look through renderings and models. The exercises presented in this book demystify the design process by providing you with specific actions that will help you get on track toward fully-formed designs. Revealing the inner workings of the design process, both theoretically and practically, Unmasking Theatre Design will jumpstart the creative processes of designers at all levels, from student to professionals, as you construct new production designs.
"Dramatic Spaces explores the effect of traditional theatrical design on the ways in which drama is understood and interpreted. By marrying theater history with literary analysis, and charting subtle shifts in the role of the audience over time, Jennifer Low shows the rich dimensions that can be overlooked when drama is treated solely as text rather than performance. Elements of semiotics, phenomenology, spatial theory, proxemics, theater history, stage design, theories of visual perception combine with case studies from Moholy Nagy to Plautus and Shakespeare to Albee demonstrate the complex relationships between text and spatiality that play such a huge role in an audience's experience"--

Art, theatre, and opera in Paris, 1750-1850: exchanges and tensions maps some of the many complex and vivid connections between art, theatre, and opera in a period of dramatic and challenging historical change, thereby deepening an understanding of familiar (and less familiar) artworks, practices, and critical strategies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Throughout this period, new types of subject matter were shared, fostering both creative connections and reflection on matters of decorum, legibility, pictorial, and dramatic structure. Correspondances were at work on several levels: conception, design, and critical judgement. In a time of vigorous social, political, and cultural contestation, the status and role of the arts and their interrelation came to be a matter of passionate public scrutiny.

A theatrical designer must address two questions when designing a production: What is the play about and what is the play like? To find the metaphor within a play is to unlock inspired and unique design concepts. Theatrical Design: An Introduction is about how to find the design idea for a production and what to do with that idea once identified. This book emphasizes script analysis and interpretation specifically for designers: how to release meaning and design inspiration from lines and characterization in a script. It then explains the artistic elements and principles of design—the skills necessary to create the design visualized. Concepts are illustrated with examples from theatre, film, art, architecture, and fashion that explore professional and historic use of conceptualization and metaphor. Theatrical Design: An Introduction imparts the tools designers need to innovate off the page.

Designing and drawing for the theatre
Throughout history, scenography has played a significant role in theatre, always drawing upon the latest technologies of manufacture and control. In the twenty-first century, it is fast becoming an artistic practice in its own right, engaging with audiences in varied ways. Christopher Baugh considers how change in scenographic identity has impacted upon the place and meaning of performance over the past 300 years. Thoroughly revised and updated, the second edition discusses: moving light technologies, the Internet as a platform of performance, urban scenography, scenography's role in the creation of memory, the development of scenography as a collaborative practice.
