The importance of emulsification techniques, their use in the production of nanoparticles for biomedical applications as well as application of rheological techniques for studying the interaction between the emulsion droplets is gathered in this reference work.Written by some of the top scientists within their respective fields, this book covers such topics as emulsions, nano-emulsions, nano-dispersions and novel techniques for their investigation. It also considers the fundamental approach in areas such as controlled release, drug delivery and various applications of nanotechnology.

"This book describes highlights in the very modern scientific world of nanotechnology. The contributions are all based on state-of-the-art principles in colloid and interface science and show how great progress in the various branches of nanotechnology can be reached. The chapters give examples of the synthesis of nanoparticles for specific applications as well as their characterization in bulk phases and at interfaces. The application of the colloid and interfacial science principles allows also developing new experimental and theoretical tools"--
