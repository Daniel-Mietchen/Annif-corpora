Abstract: Quality system.
The goal of the thesis is to study and develop business processes in a financial services company. The commissioner of the work is the Monetra Oy in Oulu. In the first phase the current state of processes is examined based on interviews of the key people in the company. At the starting point, the main key processes are identified based on services each team in the company provides to customers. In the second phase the analysis is conducted and the improvement areas are identified, in both processes and management methods for process development. The theoretical foundation presents concepts and methodologies relevant to reasoning of the documentation work, process description techniques, consideration of particular characteristics of people centric processes and finally process improvement practices. In the results section the execution of the work is explained and the findings of the analysis are introduced. The result is a documentation of business processes assigned for the study, and an analysis report with a collection of recommendations for future development actions.
