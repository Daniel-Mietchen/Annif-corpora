Deities of Tibetan Buddhism is an encyclopedia of Buddhist icons based on the Rinjung Gyatsa, the Narthang Gyatsa, and the Ratnavali. Full-color illustrations of over five hundred Tibetan Buddhist deities are reproduced here from a set of hand-painted woodblock-prints created in the early nineteenth century. This reare collection, which is the only known painted version of the Icons Worthwile to See, is presented along with an extensive explanation of the meditative visualizations, mantras, and symbolism around each figure. Deities of Tibetan Buddhism is an indispensable reference and identification aid for art historians, curators, scholars, students and admirers of Tibetan Buddhism.

The image multiplied : five centuries of printed reproductions of paintings and drawings
Forged explores art forgery from ancient times to the present. In chapters combining lively biography with insightful art criticism, Jonathon Keats profiles individual art forgers and connects their stories to broader themes about the role of forgeries in society. From the Renaissance master Andrea del Sarto who faked a Raphael masterpiece at the request of his Medici patrons, to the Vermeer counterfeiter Han van Meegeren who duped the avaricious Hermann Goring, to the frustrated British artist Eric Hebborn, who began forging to expose the ignorance of experts, art forgers have challenged "legitimate" art in their own time, breaching accepted practices and upsetting the status quo. They have also provocatively confronted many of the present-day cultural anxieties that are major themes in the arts. Keats uncovers what forgeries--and our reactions to them--reveal about changing conceptions of creativity, identity, authorship, integrity, authenticity, success, and how we assign value to works of art. The book concludes by looking at how artists today have appropriated many aspects of forgery through such practices as street-art stenciling and share-and-share-alike licensing, and how these open-source "copyleft" strategies have the potential to make legitimate art meaningful again.
