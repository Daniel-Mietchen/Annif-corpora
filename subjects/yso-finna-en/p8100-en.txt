Edward Gorey initially illustrated paperback covers and dust jackets for the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James and Charles Dickens, establishing a pen-and-ink hand-lettered style that would challenge prevailing American publishing standards and help define his publisher's visual identity. Gorey's prodigious output of hundreds of dust jackets and paperback covers evidences his distinctive flair for design and his extraordinary ability to portray the essence of the books that come his way.

Books of hours and their owners
Griffiin & Sabine, the most creative and discussed bestseller of 1991, left readers on the edge of a precipice. In the second volume of this inventive trilogy, they begin--along with Griffin--the fall. Told through strangely beautiful postcards and richly decorated letters, that actually must be taken from their envelopes to be read, the story is also culled from the sketchbook and diary kept by the possible unreal Sabine.
Artist / Author : contemporary artists' books / Cornelia Lauf and Clive Phillpot ; [book design by Renée Green ; essays by Cornelia Lauf... [et al.] ; interview with Martha Wilson by Thomas Padon] ; [organized by]: the American Federation of Arts
"A hapless circus troupe tours the countryside of a downtrodden nation, trying to earn a living the best way they know - even though their best isn't very good at all: a morose contortionist, a strongman who'd rather be miming, a lion tamer paired with an elderly dog, etc. Toward the end of a typically glum performance, Zloty Kornblatt, the troupe's ringmaster, accidentally blunders into a mockery of the nation's glorious leader. He doesn't even know why the sparse crowd is laughing, but they are - and so he continues with the inadvertent satire, ending the show on a rare triumphant note. The confused ringmaster is quickly captured, thrown into prison, and sentenced to death. The troupe must design an intricate prison-break built around their unique (and possibly useless) skills. Hijinks ensue, recounted with deadpan humor and flickering hope by Flora Bialy, Zloty's understudy and our shy narrator"--Publisher's website.

The Book Art Studio Handbook offers readers a comprehensive and accessible guide to not only the nuts and bolts of this classic art, but insight into the artisan's lifestyle. This book goes beyond quick craft projects and into the heart of bookmaking, binding, letterpress printing, decorative cover techniques, book conservation, and other book arts. It is an essential companion book for all paper lovers and bibliophiles--especially as the book as object becomes more prominent a concept-
