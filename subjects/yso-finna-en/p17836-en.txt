Today, the media and communication markets are undergoing a fundamental transformation. This thesis focuses on the market for electronic media products in the higher education market and especially on the market for scientific journals. In contrast to other media sectors this partial market shows a significantly different structure and different characteristics. For around 10 years scientific publishers have offered electronic versions of their products, which is of vital importance for the scientific communication of research activities all over the world. Content providers as well as libraries face new duties and responsibilities. Librarians especially have to cope with the new assignments as advanced information intermediaries. In view of decreasing library budgets and increasing costs for scientific information sources, the economic responsibilities have become an important issue in librarians' daily work. Thus, one major goal of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the way in which scientific content is traded over markets.

A community pharmacy IT paradox : community pharmacists' self-perception of innovativeness not matched by actual innovations
The papers in this proceedings of USE-2008. From Information Provision to Knowledge Production conference held to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Information Studies at the Faculty of Humanities, University of Oulu, Finland share a common perspective - the contributors seek to provide a multidisciplinary account of knowledge production in different contexts. The first keynote paper provides a detailed review of the issues facing managers and users of digital infrastructure who must balance the demands of data management with those of scientific publication. The second keynote contribution explores documentary practices and the materiality of science at the micro level focusing on interpersonal and transinstitutional acknowledgments. -- The contributed papers that make up the rest of the volume address the conference theme from a range of viewpoints. The first four explore knowledge management in different contexts - the difficulties of converting industrial experience into formal knowledge systems; the motives and tradeoffs that are involved in online knowledge sharing; the generation of knowledge through strategic dialogue; and the harvesting of informal travel tips in FAQ sites. The fifth paper discusses the "readiness" of government agencies in Namibia for electronic record keeping, and the sixth paper presents empirical observations on the daily media and information behaviour of senior citizens leading to concrete actions. The seventh contribution analyses citation as a discursive practice, using Dervin's work on sense-making as an example, and the last paper offers a deeper analysis than is usual in LIS of the knowing subject in the work of Descartes, making a distinction between philosophical and sociological interpretations. The authors' short CVs conclude this proceedings.

Abstract (1 s.).
"Library and Information Science Trends and Research: Europe", co-edited by Professor Amanda Spink and Dr. Jannica Heinstrom provides an understanding of the new directions in library and information science/management, education and research in Europe. The volume focuses on new research directions within the field but will also discuss curriculum changes due to the rapidly developing information world. Europe has developed substantially both socially and economically in the last ten years with a growing population and economy. The field of library and information science/management has also grown in educational and research developments as information increasingly has become a part of people's everyday social and life processes. This book is directly relevant to information scientists, information professionals and librarians, social scientists and people interested in understanding more about the trends and research in library and information science/management in the European region. Undergraduate and graduate students, academics, educators, and information professionals interested in library and information science will find this book of particular benefit.
