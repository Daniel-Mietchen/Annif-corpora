"This book breaks new ground in understanding how modern society has shaped women's knowledge system in Africa and deconstructs long-held myths about the position of ordinary women in the construction of knowledge. Using case studies, it historicizes the experiences of ordinary women in Tanzania and looks at how empowerment is used to, paradoxically, eviscerate women's knowledge systems"--Provided by publisher.
Abstract: The object of this bachelor's thesis was to study the prevalence of actualized protective measures in working with people with intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior as well as to clarify carers' views on protective measures and client participation, and whether there are possibilities for empowerment. The setting for the study was Kuusela, a department offering care, guidance and rehabilitation to adults with intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior. The theoretical framework for this study was based on values of the social field and the operating environment of Kuusela and how empowerment can be reached through participation and the right to subjectivity, self-determination, and dialog. Methods in acquiring the essential information were both qualitative and quantitative. Data on the prevalence of actualized protective measures was gathered through a documentary analysis. Data on carers' views on protective measures and client participation were gathered through a questionnaire consisting of a set of questions that were to be answered according to the Likert scale. The questionnaire also included two open-ended questions that required a written answer. The data were analysed according to qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the number of actualized protective measures had decreased from the year 2008 to 2010. Results on the carers' views showed that protective measures are needed and justified in their work. Although they seem conscious of the inhabitants' right to participatory working methods, it was not seen clearly in the everyday life. Obstacles in the implementation of this right were seen as being related to the inhabitants' shortcomings and the carers' attitudes and know-how. It can be concluded that continuous reflection on values and models of action is needed in order for the inhabitants' participation to be respected and implemented and for empowerment to be possible. The results showed that learning by living should be heightened through open professional discussions. The inhabitants' shortcomings should be dealt with in a professional manner and attitudes and knowledge on addressing these shortcomings should be dealt with through discussion and possibly through further training.

Empowerment : a challenge of non-governmental organizations in development cooperation partnerships
The majority of great innovative ideas are not discovered in a laboratory by a group of brilliant minds, nor in the executive office by the top managers. The people that deal with the company's problems, analyze the competition and service the guests on a daily base are the ones that come up with the great ideas. This fact is often overlooked by senior management who thinks that the people working under them do not understand what the company needs. The main objective of this thesis is to highlight that the regular employees of an organization play a crucial role in the innovative process, in the form of employee- driven innovations. Furthermore, the need for change that comes with having an innovative company is emphasized. The thesis in front of you isn't a conventional researched based thesis, but rather a product-oriented thesis, meaning that no qualitative or quantitative research is done. Instead the theoretical framework is the base of the product, supplemented with personal ideas, case examples and adapted views of industry professionals. The thesis product is a guide which helps managers in creating an environment where EDI can flourish, and it also contains practical tips. As can be concluded, the majority of companies with the goal of being innovative have a big chance of succeeding, as long as they abandon most of the existing idea generat-ing processes. The guide is a great starting point for managers who want to change their organization from the core and who are ready to change their existing behavior. Not only does the company of tomorrow need to promote self direction instead of management, but it also needs to loosen up and allow mistakes to be made.

"The challenge of urban deprivation and exclusion in the urban South has given rise to varied and shifting policies and ideas. Two sets of ideas have gained great currency in recent years in international policy and academic circles. The Legal Empowerment of the Poor approach, rooted in neoliberal thinking, focuses on the legal rights of the urban poor as the means to secure access to basic services and needs. The Right to the City perspective, on the other hand, stresses issues of citizenship and the appropriation and uses of urban space. This Policy Dialogue analyses the different ideological and normative foundations of the two perspectives and discusses how they lead to different policy formulations. It then takes a closer look at how the two perspectives find expression in contemporary discussions on and approaches to access to housing in urban Africa. To this end, it compares what each approach identifies as the source of the problem and recommends as the policy solution." --Publisher's description.
Democratizing inequalities : dilemmas of the new public participation
Abstract: This final project was realised in co-operation with the Ageing Migrants-activity, which functions under The Central Union for the Welfare of the Aged. This is a functional final project, which consists of a handbook for the instructors working with elderly Somalis in Finland with the aim of supporting the empowerment of the clients. The instructor's handbook is designed to be used together with a handbook for elderly Somalis.    The theoretical framework was empowerment through awakening. This report explains how empowerment and the instructor's role together with the product of the final project can help the elderly Somalis to cope in certain everyday situations in Finland. The report explains the process of the handbooks; initial planning, making, testing, evaluating, finalizing, marketing and distributing it as well as future possibilities of the product.    The client's handbook was done according to simplified language principles by using Finnish and Somali. It was desined to be used both with illiterate and literate clients. The instructor's handbook includes the same material as the client's handbook and instructions for implimenting the group sessions.    The results of testing the handbooks showed that the product supports the empowerment of elderly Somalis. Future possibilities would be to translate the handbooks into different languages and to change them to suit different cultures for using the product with other client groups.

Companies need to be ever more efficient and at the same time provide an attractive and motivating work environment. Yet, development requires change and change calls for actions. What happens when such actions, that derive from an improvement methodology originally created to serve production environment, are implemented in an organization representing today's service industry? This master thesis aimed at explaing implementation of Lean philosophy as well as employee perceptions of the resulted changes in a real-life context of a service organization. The objectives of this master thesis were to describe how a Lean project was implemented in the target organization, how and to what extent Lean methodology described in literature was utilized, how employees found the actual Lean project and the resulted changes in the work environment, as well as to present improvement ideas for similar future projects in the target organization. The theory element of the study explored the principles, methods and tools of Lean found in the literature and the practical element studied how the project was conducted in real life. The chosen actions against theory and the way employees found the project and the resulted changes were analyzed. The research was qualitative and was conducted as a case study with interviews as the primary data collection method. The findings of the research showed that Lean can be successfully implemented in a service environment when viewed from both theoretical and practical standpoint. The employees found the Lean project phase partly as stressful, hasty and sudden but also as efficient, supportive for learning, variable, well facilitated, fun and open. Improvement aspects of more time for preparations, truer communication, and more encouragement were brought forth. The perceptions of the actual changes in the workplace were partly linked to confusion, lack of general view and formality but also to improved areas of communication, organizing and learning. Recommendations for future projects included aspects of more precise communication regarding both the increased workload during the project and employees' and managers' roles in a Lean-type organization, celebrating events of success, preparations for future process optimization as well as maintaining the areas perceived positively by the employees.
