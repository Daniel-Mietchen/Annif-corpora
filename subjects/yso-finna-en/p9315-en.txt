The creativity question
This scholarly and important volume has an impressive interdisciplinary and international scope. We hear from psychologists, sociologists, philosophers, legal scholars, and economists. These refreshing chapters broaden our understanding of human innovation, contributing to a developing sociocultural approach to the study of creativity. These chapters directly challenge the myth of solitary genius, by documenting the social and cultural systems within which new ideas emerge.' - Keith Sawyer, Washington University in St Louis, US. 'This penetrating volume both summarizes compellingly what we know about creativity and examines critically loose concepts of creativity, cases where creativity does harm, and deceptive hype about creativity.This volume neither romanticizes creativity nor reduces it to the servant of economic and cultural development, offering instead a differentiated and penetrating examination of the nature of creativity and its diverse positive and sometimes negative roles.' - David Perkins, Harvard Graduate School of Education, US. This comprehensive yet concise Handbook provides an overview of innovative approaches to, and new perspectives on, the study of creativity. In this timely work, creativity is not defined by an ideal, rather it encompasses a range of theories, functions, characteristics, processes, products and practices that are associated with the generation of novel and useful outcomes suited to particular social, cultural and political contexts. Chapters present original research by international scholars from a wide range of disciplines including history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, cultural studies, education, economics and interdisciplinary studies.Their research investigates creativity in diverse fields including art, creative industries, aesthetics, design, new media, music, arts education, science, engineering and technology. Containing cutting-edge research the Handbook of Research on Creativity will strongly appeal to academics and advanced students in cultural studies, creative industries, art history and theory, experimental music and performance studies, digital and new media studies, engineering, economics, sociology, psychology and social psychology, management studies, and education - particularly visual arts education and music education. Policy makers, managers and entrepreneurs will also find much to interest them in this fascinating work.

On not knowing : how artists think
Bringing together theoretical discussion and examples of contemporary artistic practice, this book explores how artists formulate strategies of not knowing and 'play' within their decision making process and how such approaches might inform and enrich our encounters with art. This book is an important contribution to debates around the creative process and puts the artist's voice at the heart of these discussions.---Publisher.
The origins of creativity
After a decade of movement-based interaction in human-computer interaction, designing for the moving body still remains a challenge. Research in this field requires methods to help access, articulate, and harness embodied experiences in ways that can inform the design process. To address this challenge, this article appropriates bodystorming, an embodied ideation method for movement-based interaction design. The proposed method allows for early consideration of the physical, collocated, and social aspects of a designed activity as illustrated with two explorative workshops in different application domains: interactive body games and interactive performances. Using a qualitative methods approach, we used video material from the workshops, feedback from participants, and our own experience as participants and facilitators to outline important characteristics of the bodystorming method in the domain of movement-based interaction. The proposed method is compared with previous ones and application implications are discussed.

Imagination allows us to escape from the mundane and the real world, yet it also seems to furnish us with knowledge about that world-when we plan for the future, for instance. Ten original essays illuminate the epistemic role of imagination, blending perspectives from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, epistemology, aesthetics, and ethics.
