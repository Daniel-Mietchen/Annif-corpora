The goal of the project was to find a suitable, solid carrier material for a liquid manganese based catalyst. Because the catalyst in question has a liquid nature, a solid carrier is needed to create a granulated form of laundry detergent. The experimental part of the Bachelor  ́s thesis project was carried out in Rahu Catalytics technical team's laboratory in Leiden Bio Science Park, The Netherlands, during the autumn 2010.  The manganese based catalyst, 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, catalyzes hydrogen peroxide in bleaching reactions. The bleaching results of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by adding this metal transition catalyst into the bleaching solution. The project included experiment planning, set-up and implementation. The prospective solids were selected for the study on the basis of their good liquid carrying capacity. Eight silica, three zeolite and three clay materials were tested by their absorption, desorption and stability capability. The main method of testing was based on color change and whiteness determination with a spectrophotometer.  Valuable information about substance intake and release was gained. The silicas absorbed and released the catalyst most efficiently after a short period of storage, but problems with aging were encountered. Ethanol as a solvent in absorption increased the amount of catalyst absorbed in case of all solids, but this method did not affect the desorption capability favourably. Absorption made in water was considered the most favourable method. Although a perfectly suitable carrier material was not found, some interesting materials, e.g Silica 3 and Clay 2 could be studied further. The objective of the project was achieved by designing experiment set-up and performing characterization tests for candidate materials. Also gaining additional detailed information about the tested solids was succesful.

NOx adsorber catalyst technology has been successfully applied on diesel vehicles to enable them to satisfy stringent NOx emission regulations. One limitation of this technology is the requirement to regularly desulfate the adsorber to maintain high NOx conversion efficiency. In addition to adding significant engine and calibration complexity, these high temperature desulfation events accelerate the thermal degradation of the exhaust system components. Minimization of the severity and the frequency of the desulfation events is highly desirable. Laboratory studies to understand desulfation processes and to identify improved NOx Adsorber washcoat compositions are described. These studies led to a new generation of NOx adsorber catalysts with reduced desulfation temperatures, faster desulfation rates and enhanced low-temperature activity. The new generation of catalysts also enabled the potential for PGM thrifting, especially for applications with low engine- out NOx emissions. These PGM thrifted catalysts demonstrated excellent performance after exposure to long-term sulfation/desulfation/thermal aging cycles.

This thesis is a review on the plant compounds possessing effective tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme found widely in micro-organisms, plants and animals. It acts as a catalyser in the enzymatic reaction leading to the forming of pigments in the organism. The inhibition of this enzymatic process has been the focus of extensive research due to the wide range of application of products inhibiting tyrosinase activity in the food and pharmaceutical industry, and even as agents for controlling insects. The potentially harmful side-effects of the agents used for controlling tyrosinase activity have led to the need  to find safe alternatives to the ones currently used. Natural sources of tyrosinase inhibitory compounds represent a possible source for finding safe and effective inhibitors that can also be produced economically viably. The thesis has been compiled from the on-line scientific databases mostly in the forms of scientific papers. As a result, 84 plant compounds from 50 plants belonging to 27 families were found to inhibit tyrosinase activity in the range of 100 μM resulting in 50% inhibition of tyrosinase. The plants yielding the most potent inhibitors were Glycyrrhizia glabra, Sophora flavescens, Anacardium occidentale, Morus alba, Atrocarpus lakoocha, Rhododendron collettianum, Amberboa ramosa, Vitis vinifera, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Eucalyptus cneralifolia, Ecklonia stolonifera and Chamaecyparis taiwanensis. With further research on the safety and in vivo experiments on the plant compounds, the findings indicate that many plant derived compounds have prospects for future tyrosinase inhibiting applications.
