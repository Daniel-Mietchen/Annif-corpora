"Learning Theory and Online Technology offers a powerful overview of the current state of e-learning, a foundation of its historical roots and growth, and a framework for distinguishing among the major approaches to e-learning. It effectively addresses pedagogy (how to design an effective online environment for learning), evaluation (how to know that students are learning), and history (how past research can guide successful online teaching and learning outcomes). An ideal textbook for Educational Technology Masters, PhD, and Certificate programs, readers will find Learning Theory and Online Technology provides a synthesis of the key advances in e-learning theory, the key frameworks of research, and clearly links theory and research to successful learning practice".

Human-information interaction and technical communication : concepts and frameworks
This book "focuses on communicating information, not creating information. Developing information which clearly communicates and fits peopleâ€™s needs requires understanding how people think and what drives their decision processes. To help achieve that goal, this book works to provide practical knowledge based on a sound theoretical foundation for allowing people to engage in a meaningful dialogue as they make decisions with respect to designing that communication. Besides being a reference for the academic researcher or practicing technical communicator, it is written so it can be used as a reference for either a foundational or theories of technical communication course."--Provided by publisher.

Aptitude, learning, and instruction. Vol. 1, Cognitive process analyses of aptitude
Provides an overview of the major theories and research on human memory. Grounded in the premise that all psychological processes depend on memory, and that memory is shaped by how people use it, the authors look at the brain-based memory process and discuss the major theories that have been developed to explain how memory functions.
