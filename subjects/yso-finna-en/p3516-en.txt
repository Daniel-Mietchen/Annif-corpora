Following the performance of the artistic component of this thesis - four short works performed 18th May 2013 at the Theatre Academy, Helsinki - this written document aims to act as both a documentation of the process and exploration that led up to the final performance of the works as well as attempting to reflect upon and evaluate that process. In doing so, I hope to be able to consider the works relevance to the expansive fields of Live Art and performance studies whilst also continuing to question how this work has shaped my development as a performing artist.  Both the artistic and written components of the thesis have the shared title of The Body of Ariel: Metaphor vs. Metonym, inspired by the poetry anthology Ariel by American poet Sylvia Plath (1963). Both in the studio and on the page, my research has led me towards engaging with Plath's work in varied and intriguing ways, working alongside various friends and dance artists to explore the possibilities inherent within the relationship between poetry and Live Art. Questioning terms such as 'body', 'becoming' and 'in-between', the aim of working between the two art forms was not to create a live, visual version of Plath's work but rather to consider concepts and foundations that might be shared between the two art forms, and to consider the possibilities of merging these elements. These explorations led the work beyond its primary concerns and towards questions of relation, the 'other', and repetition, within both Plath's poetry and the live form of my practice.  Whilst I have attempted to document the progression of my work in chronological order, I recognise that an artistic process as such rarely follows such a lateral structure (i.e. the exploration became more of a web than a step by step process) with elements feeding into others and folding back on themselves in such a way that has made the attempt to document the work in a comprehensible manner somewhat challenging. Therefore, I have chosen to include within this work various sources in an attempt to clarify and support the work. In particular, I have chosen to include large extracts from my sketchbook, which provides the most insight into the process within its present time (and by insight, I mean not just for the reader but also for myself as an artist in reflecting back on the progress of the work). In addition, I have included still images taken from films documenting various stages of the rehearsal process, which I would use to record and reflect upon the work as it progressed, and I have included photographs from the performances taken by Antti Ahonen and Sanna Kasma to provide the reader with a visual reference to the works.  So far, this written document has served to clarify the numerous ideas and explorations of the past year that were a part of this project and have enabled me to see how the work may continue beyond itself: either seeping into other works and projects or simply as a continuation on what has passed.

Windows to the mind : metaphor, metonymy and conceptual blending
"This lively introduction to figurative language explains a broad range of concepts, including metaphor, metonymy, simile, and blending, and develops new tools for analyzing them. It coherently grounds the linguistic understanding of these concepts in basic cognitive mechanisms such as categorization, frames, mental spaces, and viewpoint; and it fits them into a consistent framework which is applied to cross-linguistic data and also to figurative structures in gesture and the visual arts. Comprehensive and practical, the book includes analyses of figurative uses of both word meanings and linguistic constructions. [bullet] Provides definitions of major concepts [bullet] Offers in-depth analyses of examples, exploring multiple levels of complexity [bullet] Surveys figurative structures in different discourse genres [bullet] Helps students to connect figurative usage with the conceptual underpinnings of language [bullet] Goes beyond English to explore cross-linguistic and cross-modal data"--

"'Metonymy' is a type of figurative language used in everyday conversation, a form of shorthand that allows us to use our shared knowledge to communicate with fewer words than we would otherwise need. 'I'll pencil you in' and 'let me give you a hand' are all examples of metonymic language and serve a wide range of communicative functions such as textual cohesion, humour, irony, euphemism and hyperbole - all of which play a key role in the development of language and discourse communities. Using authentic data throughout, the book shows how metonymy operates, not just in language, but also in gesture, sign language, art, music, film and advertising. It explores the role of metonymy in cross-cultural communication, along with the challenges it presents to language learners and translators. Ideal for researchers and students in linguistics and literature, as well as teachers and general readers interested in the art of communication"--
Metonymy and metaphor in grammar
"This volume explains how metaphors, metonymies, and other figures of thought interact cognitively and rhetorically to tell us what writing is and what it should do. Drawing on interviews with writing professionals and published commentary about writing, it argues that our everyday metaphors and metonymies for writing are part of a figurative rhetoric of writing - a pattern of discourse and thought that includes ways we categorize writers and writing; stories we tell about people who write; conceptual metaphors and metonymies used both to describe and to guide writing; and familiar, yet surprisingly adaptable, conceptual blends used routinely for imagining writing situations. The book will give scholars a fresh understanding of concepts such as 'voice', 'self', 'clarity', 'power', and the most basic figure of all: 'the writer'"--Provided by publisher.
