testing by executing the models of a communication network to stimulate an implementation of a system in the network with legal inputs and observing the behavior of the implementation. As a case study, specific parts of the LTE control plane focusing on the initial attach, tracking area updating, and detach procedures are modeled and the transformation tool is applied on the models. An implementation of an LTE network node is developed to determine its compliance with the designed models using the UPPAAL-TRON testing tool.

"This interdisciplinary volume from a leading international group of scholars offers coherent sociological answers as to how and in what respects finance is 'emotional'. Chapters offer sophisticated approaches to the current financial crisis, and the antecedents in cultural variations in institutions and organisational forms."--
Timing analysis of UML sequence diagrams
It is always believed that a company or an organization in a particular city or country having the proper mechanism to govern the entire organization is regarded as an effective and efficient company. Every organizational company has a staff that helps the company to achieve its aims and objectives. A company which does not have the resources to manage its staff is considered as having loopholes in their day to day activities. “Otchpaul Chemist Ghana Limited” is based in Ghana and it does not have the proper application software to enable it to manage its staff efficiently and effectively. This company's main business is to manufacture drugs for the people of Ghana. The company has almost 50 employees working in various sectors throughout the country. The company still uses a manual file based system to record employee activities, which makes it difficult to trace a specific employee record. This thesis project entitled “Software Requirement Analysis for Employee Management System” was set to improve the company's current situation of recording employee information. It consists of all the services required to record employee information. The main functions were to handle basic employee information, to record different events concerning the employees, to print employee reports and to manage the company data. The method used to carry out the software requirements analysis was based on the Object Oriented Analysis Methods and Unified Modeling Language (UML). This Software Requirement Document (SRD) will serves as a guide during the actual implementation of the system. The development of this application software will be able to reduce the problem of maintaining and retrieving employee records. This application software would be a major improvement over the existing, outmoded system.

"The financial crisis that started in 2007 is a concern for the world. Some countries are in depression and governments are desperately trying to find solutions. In the absence of thorough debate on the emotions of money, bitter disputes, hatred and 'moralizing' can be misunderstood. New Perspectives on Emotions in Finance carefully considers emotions often left unacknowledged, in order to explain the socially useful versus de-civilising, destructive, nature of money. This book offers an understanding of money that includes the possible civilising sentiments. This interdisciplinary volume examines what is seemingly an uncontrollable, fragile world of finance and explains the 'panics' of traders and 'immoral panics' in banking, 'confidence' of government and commercial decision makers, 'shame' or 'cynicism' of investors and asymmetries of 'impersonal trust' between finance corporations and their many publics. Money is shown to rely on this abstract trust or 'faith', but such motivations are in crisis with 'angry' conflicts over the 'power of disposition'. Restraining influences - on 'uncivilised emotions' and rule breaking - need democratic consensus, due to enduring national differences in economic 'sentiments' even in ostensibly similar countries. Promising ideas for global reform are assessed from these cautionary interpretations"--
