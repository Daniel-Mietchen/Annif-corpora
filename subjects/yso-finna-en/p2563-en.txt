Finland is a small open economy, where fluctuations in exports and imports have shaped the big picture of developments in the economy. A historical review of these developments suggests that the current situation provides no such conditions for rapid export growth supporting the economy as those seen in the earlier growth phases of economic history. Despite facing difficulties, the forest industry is still one of the pillars of Finnish exports alongside the machinery and metal industry..

Key words:Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), economic integration, Russia, foreign trade. .

Comparative advantage and characteristics of Russia's  trade with the European Union
To the surprise of many observers, the Russian economy began to show signs of growth within a few months of the August 1998 crisis. The depreciation of the rouble brought about extensive import substitution in the economy, and as a result, production of consumer goods, such as clothing, is rising briskly.Certain export-oriented sectors, such as non-ferrous metallurgy, also took off.Among the most encouraging aspects of the current Russian economy, the author notes growth in investments, machine building and certain high-tech industries.Even so, most Russian exports are still commodities.Thus, the author argues that economic sustainable recovery will require a shift in the export structure of Russian industry towards advanced, value-added products. Key words: Russian economy, economic growth, import substitution, foreign trade .

"With the scope of Dune and the commercial action of Independence Day, this near-future trilogy is the first chance for English-speaking readers to experience this multple-award-winning phenemonenon from China's most beloved science fiction author. Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision"

The paper analyzes development of Sino-Russian trade in the period 1985-1995, considering both the general state of relations between the two countries and internal logic of transitional processes taking place in China and Russia. The authors start with an analysis of trade dynamics and a review of the commodity composition of exports and imports.The following sections deal with regional cooperation and border trade.On the basis of their analysis, the authors conclude that, in spite of problems, Sino-Russian trade for the period of 1985-1995 developed quite rapidly and still possesses the substantial potential for sustainable future growth. .

Facing the challenges in exporting in Russia
Abstract: Market opportunities for ivk-tuote in Murmansk region.
Up to the end of 1991, more than 90 % of Baltic trade was conducted with other parts of the Soviet Union, where trade was organized not on the basis of voluntary exchange but strictly guided by Moscow.The subsequent collapse of central planning caused widespread disruption in trade and financial links. Nevertheless, the Baltic countries, to a certain extent, retained their strong dependence on trade with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, and as a result saw their terms of trade decrease by 10-15 % of GDP.Further, they experienced high inflation, dramatic output declines, shortages of goods and raw materials, and dysfunctional payment and monetary arrangements.To correct this situation and avoid prolonged economic difficulties, Baltic trade links with the West were restored, as well as economic relations among the Baltic nations themselves. From the trade policy point of view, Estonia followed the most liberal course by eliminating trade restrictions altogether. Latvia and Lithuania have favoured more protectionist policies. Estonia and Latvia have consistently strived to boost their trade with the West, while Lithuania still maintains stronger trade relations with Russia. Despite the fact that the Baltic countries have a free trade agreement and numerous actions have been taken to promote intra-Baltic trade links, current problems at macro- and microeconomic level as well as trade policy differences constitute major obstacles to trade creation and greater cooperation among the Baltic states.Further, the smallness of the Baltic market and the general sameness of tradeable products tend to limit the possibilities for intraregional trade.As a consequence, growth in intraregional trade has remained quite modest. Keywords: foreign trade, integration, Baltic countries .

Abstract. The purpose of this thesis was to compare mainly a representative office with a sub-sidiary in Germany and in Poland. The emphasis is on the boundary conditions, in which situation what operations model would be the best to use, and when is it a time to move from a distributor into establishing a company abroad. This study has been conducted for a case company's needs regarding establishing a new business form in Germany and in Poland. The study was carried out by first explaining in the theoretical part the different op-eration forms, followed by analyzing the political, economical, social, technological, legal and environmental factors of Germany and Poland. A qualitative research method was used in the study. In empirical part the results of semistructured interviews are revealed. The questions were sent to the interviewees before the interview which was done via telephone. This was done in order for them to get familiar with the questions. The research results of PESTLE -analyses revealed both Germany and Poland to be excellent locations for establishing a new business form. Germany has good connections to other European countries; in addition, the excellent port connections create good transportation possibilities to countries outside of the Europe. Also because of the strong economy of Germany it has appealed foreign investors. Poland has also good connections to countries and due to its growing economy and reasonable low costs it offers an interesting location for foreign investors. The outcomes of the results of the interviews are revealed and recommendations are given at the end of this thesis.

The paper analyzes the development in Russian-European Union trade in the transition.After a significant adjustment of the trade data, and a short overview of the general development in Russian trade, the author analyses the trade dynamics and the commodity composition of exports and imports, using 3 and 5-digit Standard International Trade Classification.The outcome of the analysis shows that although Russian exports since 1992 have increased in terms of variety, the development in manufacturing exports is disappointing, especially with regard to light manufacturing and consumer goods.And not surprisingly Russia reveals a comparative advantage in minerals and metals.The level of intra-industry trade between Russia and the EU remains low and there is no sign of an increase; the opposite pattern from that of the Central European countries.On the whole this study shows that there are no clear signs of changes to the structure of foreign trade between Russia and the EU, to some extent the result of the lack of restructuring in the Russian economy.  Keywords: Russia, European Union, foreign trade, revealed comparative advantage, intra-industry trade .

"Pirates, Prostitutes and Pullers reveals the lively history of Southeast Asia's underclass - the peasants, urban coolies, prostitutes, maritime raiders and sea nomads who played a formative role in the region's remarkable transformation." "The sixteen essays in this collection focus on critically important themes such as the meaning and constitution of 'culture': the global political economy, human trafficking, urbanization, and colonial policy and practice. Professor Warren utilizes documentary sources, oral traditions, photographs, and paintings to provide not only an erudite example of the exploratory power of historical ethnography but also new conceptual frameworks for our understanding of Southeast Asian history."--Book jacket.

From the foreign press : two centuries of American history. Vol. 1
Prospects for Russias membership in the WTO now look better than any point since accession negotiations began almost a decade ago. Good progress with economic and legal reforms within Russia has left the countrys economy better prepared for membership. Nevertheless, the economy still suffers from various weaknesses including, but not limited to, pervasive subsidies for different sectors, lack of liberalization and foreign participation especially in the service sector, inefficiency in custom administration, lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights, etc.For all their sensitivity, the negotiations on the import tariff levels and access to the service sectors are the least of the problems.Much more difficult will be non-tariff barriers and the general trade-related legislative framework. Resolving the remaining weaknesses would be a complex process. However, given the importance of WTO-related measures for the overall domestic structural reform, any delay in accession would be at least marginally negative for investor perceptions of country risk. Key words: Russia, WTO, tariff, reform  JEL classification: F1, P2. .
Confessions from correspondent-land : the dangers & delights of life as a foreign correspondent
"With the scope of Dune and the rousing action of Independence Day, this near-future trilogy is the first chance for English-speaking readers to2 8xperience this multple-award-winning phenemonenon from China's most beloved science fiction author. In Dark Forest, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion--in just four centuries' time. The aliens' human collaborators may have been defeated, but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are totally exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies, hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead"-- Provided by publisher

The 1990s have seen the delinking of the Baltic economies from Soviet industrial structures, rapid liberalization of local economies and foreign trade, and a burst of trade expansion. Estonia's exports, in particular, have grown consistently at a sufficiently high rate to bring about solid export-led growth for its economy.The article gives an overview of the changes that have taken place in the foreign trade of the Baltic countries, paying particular attention to Nordic-Baltic trade relations and possible future developments in trade. Underlying overall trade development, the Baltics' trade reorientation to the West has been profound and rapid, especially in Estonia's case.Russia and the other CIS members have been replaced by the EU as the Baltics' main trading partner.Latvia and Lithuania have reoriented themselves to the non-Nordic EU, while Estonian foreign trade is heavily concentrated on Finland and Sweden.Application of a gravity model of trade suggests (in contrast to results obtained for foreign trade of central and eastern European countries in transition) that the Baltic countries' foreign trade with a few European countries has exceeded its potential, in particular Finland and Sweden.The extreme is seen in Finnish exports to Estonia which have grown far larger than the estimated potential.The implication is a decline in the share of the two Nordic countries in the Baltics' foreign trade. The structure of Finnish and Swedish trade with the Baltic countries differs considerably from the structure of Finland's and Sweden's foreign trade in general.Trade is concentrated in resource- and labour-intensive goods, while intra-industry trade is less significant.Nordic-Baltic trade levels, above all Finnish-Estonian trade, have been influenced by a number factors in the opening up of the Baltic economies.These include proximity, lack of competition, free trade arrangements, intermediation of goods and, in Estonia's case, direct investment by Finnish and Swedish companies.A major identifiable element supporting the development of Estonian trade with Finland and Sweden is outward processing in the fields of textiles and machinery. In the medium and long run, the Baltic countries will have to tackle several wider issues influencing their external sector. These issues include the sustainability of competitiveness in the production of labour-intensive products in the face of efforts by other low-cost producers; the limits imposed by marginal natural resource wealth; the viability of commercial agriculture at such northern latitudes; the exploit ability of forest resources; and development of "east-west" transport/shipping gateways and production geared toward eastern markets.Scarcity of evident competitive advantages and uncertainty related to many fields emphasize two priorities, ie the maintenance of economic stability in terms of policy and institutions, and further investment in relatively well-educated populaces. Keywords: foreign trade, Baltic countries, Nordic countries. .

The adjustment of Finnish expatriates in Britain with special reference to communicative comperence : a case study
While the European Union and Russia are actively working to strengthen their relations, the challenge of effective cooperation can only be called problematic given the pressures faced by an expanding EU and the dynamics of present-day Russia.Nevertheless, the arguments for improving relations for both parties are overwhelming as closer ties ultimately promote the economic prosperity and political stability of the entire region. EU-Russian cooperation is presently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).The EU and Russia have also agreed to start discussions on creation of a free trade area. While the framework of cooperation is already in place, implementation of the PCA will demand greater resources than current capacity allows.Russia will bear the heaviest burden as it will have to develop functions longestablished in the EU.To ease this transition, the EU provides technical assistance to Russia through its Tacis programme and similar programmes.These constitute a good-faith commitment on the part of the EU to a functioning market economy, political democracy as well as a working system of education and social welfare in Russia. Both parties acknowledge the other's importance as a trading partner currently, trade mainly consits of oil, natural gas and refined metals exported by Russia and machinery and vechiles exported by the EU.The asymmetry of this relationship complicates competition and trade policy.Russia's competitive weaknesses in certain sectors make it very tempting to revert to protectionist pressures which will hinder liberalization of trade and potentially jeopardize the implementation of the PCA. Although critics have called attention to the excessive optimism and impracticalities of the PCA and Tacis, they nevertheless concede that their spirit embodies a willingness by both parties to promote better relations.And despite obvious areas of contention between the EU and Russia (especially in trade policies), there has been a consistent willingness to discuss positions and seek mutually acceptable solutions.Given the general complexity of EU-Russia relations, this willingness to sort things out will be fundamental to all future progress. Keywords: Russia, EU, integration, foreign trade, partnership and cooperation agreement .
