As more people flock to urban areas to live, nowhere are the empowering principles of permaculture more needed and desired than in our cities. Author Toby Hemenway (Gaia's Garden) demonstrates that the same nature-based approach that connects the pieces of our landscape together in harmonious ways applies perfectly to our need for water, shelter, food, energy, livelihood, and community. Hemenway moves beyond urban gardening and offers readers practical tips as well as examples from around the country of how people are using permaculture principles to live more sustainably and build deeper connections in urban areas. The Permaculture City also documents the rise of a new sophistication, depth, and diversity in the approaches and thinking of permaculture designers and practitioners, and provides hope and opportunity for our cities, towns, and suburbs.
