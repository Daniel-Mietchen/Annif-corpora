he ungoing economic reform in Russia has in many respects proceeded without taking into consideration the social questions, which, however, are an essential part of the transformation from socialist planning to a market economy.In order to not to exceed the limit, which the most suffering part of the population can bear, it is vital to migitate the negative social consequences of the reform within the budget constraint.In our view it is possible to find a compromise between social and economic problems through priorising the most acute social problems and the most vulnerable groups of people as well as optimising forms and methods of economic reform in order to minimize its social consequences. The study is organised as follows: the chapter one stresses the actuality of questions related to social sector.The chapter two concentrates on statistical problems in analyzing the situation in the Russian social sector.The main social problems - poverty, unemployment, the situation in medicine, culture, science and education as well as the military, political and criminal insecurity - are analyzed in chapter three.The development of the situation in mentioned social spheres has been analyzed mainly in the period of 1992 - 1996 with the emphasis on the years 1995-1996. The chapter four consists of two parts.The first one gives a picture of the regional differences of social problems, which in Russia are large.The other part of the chapter is devoted to classification of Russians into groups according to their incomes and naming the most acute social problems for these groups.As a conclusion a table of the objective and subjective reasons for the critical situation in Russian social sector is presented. Keywords: social sector, poverty, unemployment, medicine, culture, science, education, criminality, Russia .

AbstractA deteriorating demographic situation, rising unemployment, difficulties in taxes, and a growing informal sector have created substantial difficulties during recent years for the pay-asyou-go (PAYG) pension systems in Baltic countries.For the purpose of guaranteeing solid pension systems, all three Baltic countries are implementing "three-pillar" systems, which supporters claim will be more robust to demographic changes.Latvia leads the Baltics in pension reform, having all pillars of the system working. Nevertheless, Baltic pension reform remains a politically thorny issue.This fact may delay plans to have three-pillar systems operational in all three countries by the beginning of 2003.Keywords: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Pension systems, Social security .

Abstract: The object of this bachelor's thesis was to study the prevalence of actualized protective measures in working with people with intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior as well as to clarify carers' views on protective measures and client participation, and whether there are possibilities for empowerment. The setting for the study was Kuusela, a department offering care, guidance and rehabilitation to adults with intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior. The theoretical framework for this study was based on values of the social field and the operating environment of Kuusela and how empowerment can be reached through participation and the right to subjectivity, self-determination, and dialog. Methods in acquiring the essential information were both qualitative and quantitative. Data on the prevalence of actualized protective measures was gathered through a documentary analysis. Data on carers' views on protective measures and client participation were gathered through a questionnaire consisting of a set of questions that were to be answered according to the Likert scale. The questionnaire also included two open-ended questions that required a written answer. The data were analysed according to qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the number of actualized protective measures had decreased from the year 2008 to 2010. Results on the carers' views showed that protective measures are needed and justified in their work. Although they seem conscious of the inhabitants' right to participatory working methods, it was not seen clearly in the everyday life. Obstacles in the implementation of this right were seen as being related to the inhabitants' shortcomings and the carers' attitudes and know-how. It can be concluded that continuous reflection on values and models of action is needed in order for the inhabitants' participation to be respected and implemented and for empowerment to be possible. The results showed that learning by living should be heightened through open professional discussions. The inhabitants' shortcomings should be dealt with in a professional manner and attitudes and knowledge on addressing these shortcomings should be dealt with through discussion and possibly through further training.
