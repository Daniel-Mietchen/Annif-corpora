The thesis was commissioned by HAMK University of Applied Sciences, Degree Programme of Information Technology, Forssa. The thesis  describes the experiences and findings of HAMK teams participating in the Artemis Contests in seasons 2007 in Berlin, 2008 in Athens and 2009 in Nice. Also some suggestions for the contest arranger, participants and supporting organizations as well as for national and international university level cooperation in relation to organizing contestant teams and similar projects are provided.  A survey was conducted to collect experiences of the teams and team mem-bers by issuing a questionnaire and by interviewing team members. Also the project execution was reflected against Project Based Learning, PBL, as reported by HAMK's INSKE study, a report of a study on developing Bachelor Degree education. The main results are related to managing technology contest projects. The question of how to run an international project aimed at participating in a technology contest, has several aspects to be taken into account such as technological research and international relations. Any organization with very little prior experience in project work needs a tight discipline in reporting and documenting of individual work. The thesis includes suggestions for future contests such as Artemis Orchestra Contest and further use of the equipment built on the contestant projects as part of partner universities' international marketing
