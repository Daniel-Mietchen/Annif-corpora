Mergers and acquisitions (hereafter also 'M&A') have been a common method for companies to grow and increase shareholder value. Brands relate to the experience stakeholders and herein especially customers enjoy when being in any interaction with a company. As a result of transactions, companies can only only ensure positive future financial performance and succeed in the market when also managing brand experiences systematically. This study examines the role of brands in international M&A with relation to financial performance among companies in Finland. The importance of brands in decision-making, the actions of brand management as well as the financial measurement of brands in transactions are in the focus of this study. Since this research was commissioned by a Finnish brand management consultancy called BrandWorxx Oy, the center of attention is also on suggestions for service development. The research at hand includes theories which are built around brands as well as M&A as key concepts. First of all, the term 'brand' is defined, the connection to financial performance illustrated and a systematic brand management process described. Next, M&A are introduced including motivations, the process as well as due diligence. After taking a look at company and brand valuation approaches, key concepts are connected and brand management as well as exploitation opportunities as part of M&A are shown. In order to meet the research objectives, empirical work with more qualitative but also quantitative aspects was carried out through mostly personal interviews. Results and findings show that the importance of brands as a decision-making criterion is of a relatively high importance level. However, brands are mostly not systematically managed nor financially tracked as part of transactions. Due to this, bigger financial value is assumed to be lost since stakeholders and especially customers are not in the focus of transactions. Finally, a need for the commissioning company to develop a specific service offering became obvious.The report thus provides detailed suggestions mentioned at the end of this study.

This book is one of the very few published investigations of international business in a Japanese context, based on an up-to-date overview of the Japanese mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in particular. The author explicates recent developments in Japanese business and shows how Japanese firms drastically change to reach out to become more globalized. The book can serve as a foundation in a teaching module for any Japan-related class in international business. Specifically, this publication reveals the inner workings of the Japanese business system. M&A activities covered here include those of foreign firms in Japan as well as Japanese firms investing domestically and in cross-border ventures. Illustrated by carefully chosen examples and supported by extensive data analyses, this book is highly recommended to readers who seek an in-depth understanding of the Japanese M&A market. The volume is enriched by case studies that explicitly illustrate the objectives of specific firms and how they successfully manage their M&A. The author brings to this work his 14 years of experience in Japan and has relied not only on English literature but also on original Japanese sources in creating this highly valuable contribution to the field.

The role of communication and integration managers in international mergers and acquisitions
Weinberg on take-overs and mergers
Cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) activity has experienced waves of popularity during the past fifty years. M&A plays an important role in today's business world. Yet, M&A activity has a relatively high failure rate which can be caused by many reasons, such as legitimacy and anti-monopoly. In fact, among these reasons, the human side of M&A is often ignored by managers, especially in phase of post-M&A. The objective of this thesis is to stress the importance of understanding what happens with managers and employees in the organization during the merger and acquisition process. Furthermore, the author will investigate what are the consequences of incomplete HR integration, and how to resolve these threats in order to achieve success in cross-border M&A. In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of cross-national M&A and importance of HR influence, literature study as the theoretical method and case study will be used. In case study, three unstructured interviews with WAHAHA general manager, technical director and sales manager who have extensive knowledge in this subject will be introduced. This research provides tenable results and suggestions on how to promote long-term development of HR in phase of post-M&A. This thesis found that there are three key elements that wield great influence on post M&A: corporate culture and identity, leadership and communication, and motivation and commitment. In conclusion, cultural marriage, leadership and management coordination, and effective communication help to achieve and measure HR integration in cross-border M&A. The target beneficiaries of this thesis include executives, managers and personnel who engage in cross-border M&A.

"Since Intelligent M&A was released in June 2007, the short and final chapter on How to survive a merger has received a lot of attention and the information provided therein appears to be robust enough to withstand that attention. Therefore, the proposed book will build on the organisation of that chapter and would be divided roughly into the following chapters: - Background on mergers and acquisitions: why companies merge and what happens to employees in those mergers - The first decision facing employees: stay or leave? - Attitude and personal performance - Timing issues: when to act? - Preparation during the pre-merger phase - Should you rely on your boss (and to what degree to 'trust' the company)? - The need to stay around the office - Taking care of your own team - Networking  internally and externally - Maintaining clients - The importance of flexibility in accepting new assignments - Preparing for the worst. Written in an engaging style, with real global case studies, this is an extremely valuable guide for any manager or employee concerned about their jobs when their companies are undergoing a corporate restructuring. (NB. The book is intended to be of use to readers globally. It therefore does not have a chapter on legal issues in being made redundant, as this information is out-dated quickly, isn't the expertise of the author and is available from experts elsewhere)"--Provided by publisher.
Regulating financial services and markets in the twenty first century
Merger and acquisition as a mode of entry to foreign markets : case: Finnish Fair Corporation
The decision to carry out a merger or acquisition is certainly a risky one, not least because of the number of variables influencing the final outcome. It is also a decision frequently based on the wrong objectives and an incorrect evaluation process. With this in mind, this important new book offers solutions for reducing the high percentage of mergers and acquisitions (M & As) that fail. It adopts a normative approach, using theoretical analysis to show what managers could and should do to increase shareholders' value through successful M & A strategies. It also explores the conditions that are suitable for favouring a certain type of M&A (horizontal, vertical, or diversified) over the others.

Acquisitions of minority shareholdings in the light of the EU merger control
On 1 August 2008, the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law entered into force, introducing a comprehensive framework for competition law to the Chinese market. One set of the new rules pertains to merger control. Chinas Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was nominated as the authority responsible for enforcing merger control in China, and has been actively doing so ever since. Recent years have established China as one of the most important merger filing jurisdictions for cross-border mergers alongside the EU and USA. This work evaluates the Chinese merger control law regime and MOFCOMs decision-making practice after more than five years of application. In particular, it assesses which policy goals (competition policy goals or industrial policy considerations) prevail in the written law and its application, and provides suggestions for a further improvement of the law with the aim to develop a transparent merger control regime that promotes long-term economic growth in China.
FFusion 2 technology programme 1999-2002 : final report
The thesis aims to reveal the strategic objectives of Finnish ICT company X in the cross-border acquisition of Y - a Russian ICT services provider. This study attempts to conclude a comprehensive pre-acquisition research and thereby contribute to the accomplishment of acquisition objectives. Why should company X acquire company Y? The author approaches this question from the acquirer's perspective and identifies X's major motives for entering in the M&A transaction. In the theoretical research the author reviews the existing literature on the topic and identifies the major taxonomies of acquisition drivers. The theoretical perspectives adopted by scholars to explain the phenomenon of corporate M&A are also examined and highlighted. Next, building on previously discussed theories, the author proposes his own model of feasibility conditions under which the various drivers for M&A transactions would operate. Finally, the model is employed for the case acquisition analysis. The empirical research is based upon the qualitative research method. In the course of interviews with X's management the author tests the proposed model of M&A motives in relation to the case transaction. This is followed by the discussion of the opportunities which make the acquisition of Y feasible, the emerging constraints, and the academic theories which best explain the case in point. The most important strategic objectives of X cross-border acquisition on the Russian market include a number of synergetic gains such as diversification, vertical integration benefits and operational synergies. Evidence has been found to support the connections between the case acquisition's motives and the efficiency theory of mergers.

Miracles : alternative version
Cross-border mergers and acquisitions (CBM&As) activity continues to excite interest among academics and practicing managers, and has become an important vehicle for firms' internationalization and corporate restructuring over the past three decades. Despite the huge volume of global CBM&A activity, however, there are few books that carefully explore the strategies, motives, and consequences of global mergers and acquisitions. This book discusses and synthesizes the theoretical literature on the motivation and performance of international merger activities. Focusing on the UK as a top acquiring country in the European Union, the authors explore the recent trends in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, motives for cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the mergers integration process, home and host countries' macroeconomic consequences on mergers and acquisitions, and shareholder's wealth effects on CBM&A.This book explores and sheds much-needed light on the UK CBM&A market, what drives it, and what lessons can be learned for other regions around the globe.
