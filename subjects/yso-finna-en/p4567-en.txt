"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)

Recent Advances in Prolactin Research summarizes the current knowledge of prolactin (PRL), PRL receptor, PRL-dependent signaling pathways, the role of PRL in oncogenesis and PRL crosstalk with other oncogenic factors. The chapters are written by experts in these fields and focus on identifying and reviewing timely experimental findings that provide new insights into the expanding role of PRL in the pathophysiology associated with a variety of human conditions. Prolactin is a peptide hormone that is best known for its role in lactation. Prolactin also has an influence on hematopoiesis and angiogenesis, and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. Although PRL was discovered more than 80 years ago, the understanding of PRL signaling and its relationship to various pathologies is still very incomplete. PRL is not only a pituitary hormone with an important role in reproduction, but PRL also acts as a cytokine, modulating a wide variety of physiological processes. For example, data gathered during the last decade have demonstrated that locally produced PRL acts as the autocrine/paracrine factor and plays a contributory role during breast oncogenesis. In fact, the scientific and clinical communities have suggested that the manipulation of the PRL axis may lead to the successful treatment of breast cancer. However, recent work has demonstrated that the role of the PRL axis is much more complex than first envisaged.

Venous malformations (VMs) are localized defects in vascular morphogenesis which can seriously impede or even threaten the patient's life. VMs are characterized by enlarged, torturous vein-like channels lined by unevenly distributed smooth muscle cells. A large number of mutations in the endothelial TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinase have been found from more than half of the lesions screened, thus providing a common genetic cause. TIE2 has a crucial role in vascular development, remodeling and quiescence. However, the molecular and cellular abnormalities caused by TIE2-mutations in endothelial cells and how they relate to VM formation have been unknown.The aim of this study was to examine how VM-specific mutations affect the molecular characteristics of TIE2-receptor downstream signaling and cellular functions. Because no effective treatment has been available for VMs, a better understanding of the molecular basis of their pathology should enable the development of more potent and non-invasive treatments as well as provide a better understanding of vascular morphogenesis in general.The results demonstrate that the TIE2-VM forms have both common and specific effects on TIE2 and the endothelial cells (ECs) expressing them. Mutation-induced TIE2 autoactivation leading to loss of normal EC monolayer organization due to extracellular matrix (ECM) fibronectin deficiency was found to be a common change. This was shown to occur through chronic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which also caused activation of the proteolytic plasminogen system. Also, most mutations altered TIE2 trafficking and angiopoietin ligand regulated TIE2 functions, albeit through different mechanisms. Using RNA-screening we showed that the most common sporadic TIE2-VM mutation dysregulates genes affecting vascular development, cell migration and ECM remodeling. PDGFB, a major attractant of vascular mural cells, was found to be strongly attenuated due to chronic activation of Akt, which also increases EC survival, by the TIE2 mutant receptors.To conclude, the results in this thesis reveal genetic, molecular and cellular alterations which may potentiate VM formation. This data provides new information on the pathological mechanisms behind abnormal vascular morphogenesis and should assist the development of new molecular treatment strategies for VM patients.
