Climate change 1994 : radiative forcing of climate change and an evaluation of the IPCC IS92 emission scenarios
This second edition of an Artech House classic title describes in detail the relationship between radiometry and photometry. It covers information needed to solve problems in radiation transfer and detection, detectors, measuring instruments, and concepts in colorimetry. This revised second edition presents an updated treatment of modern radiometry and photometry, including brand new sections on applications and developments in light sources and scientific instruments for measuring radiation and light. Engineers are also provided with an exciting new chapter on the use of computerized optical ray tracing for "virtual" experiments on optical systems. Market Optical engineers; electrical engineers; lighting designers.
