The following morning, Mother led Israel and Elizabeth out of the house and spoke to them as follows: "Last night, when we were in the worship of God, I saw a number of souls rise from the dead, and come into the resurrection of life. And when you [Israel] was here before, I saw your mother [his mother had been dead thirty years] and when you was released, and your flesh turned to its natural color again, she was released also and came into the resurrection...Israel, you have begun to bear for other souls, and you must never give out, till the last soul is gathered in. When you get home, tell your father and stepmother that your mother is risen from the dead."" - from the book. A fascinating introduction to the world of the early Shakers, this anthology documents the contributions to Shaker religion made by women during its first seventy years. This period (1780-1851) saw Mother Ann Lee's complex legacy as the founder of a new religion realized in a network of nineteen separatist celibate communities in eight states. By giving us a closer look at the ways in which women influenced the evolution of the religion during this formative era, this book contributes to a more accurate vision of Shakerism and highlights the ways in which gender can play an important role in the creation of a new religious institution.
