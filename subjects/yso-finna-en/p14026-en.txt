How can you develop your students' science understanding whilst helping them really enjoy the subject? How can you boost your own enthusiasm for science lessons? How does science help grow children's creativity? Teaching Science Creatively offers ideas to involve your students and demonstrate the potential of creative teaching to develop children's knowledge, skills, understanding and attitudes. Under-pinned by theory and research, it offers informed and practical support to both students in initial teacher education, and practising teachers who want to develop their teaching. Illustrated by examples of children's work, this book explores the core elements of creative practice in relation to developing enthusiastic, passionate science learners. Creative ways to explore scientific and technological understanding are offered throughout. Key themes addressed include: teachers' and students' attitudes towards science; the relationship between the nature of science; teacher's pedagogy and children's learning; theories of learning and young children's creative development; play, schemas, science and how we treat children's ideas; covering traditional topics in a creative way - games, drama, role play, puppets, mini safaris and welly walks!; investigating science with new technologies - digital cameras, digital microscopes, GPS, Google Earth; and, using the outdoors creatively.
