The Finnish financial system has operated smoothly amid the difficult economic conditions of the past few years. However, financial stability can never be taken for granted. Due to the structural vulnerabilities of the financial system - the concentration and interconnectedness of the financial sector - the consequences of financial crisis could be particularly serious in Finland. To strengthen the stability of the system, the macroprudential toolkit available to the Finnish authorities should be brought to an internationally comparable level..

As Jeff Madrick makes clear, the single-minded pursuit of huge personal wealth has been on the rise in the United States since the 1970s, led by a few individuals who argue that self-interest guides society more effectively than community concerns. In telling the stories of these politicians, economists, and financiers who declared a moral battle for freedom but instead gave rise to an age of greed, Madrick traces the lineage of some of our nation's most pressing economic problems. He begins with Walter Wriston, head of what would become Citicorp, who led the battle against government regulation. He examines the ideas of economist Milton Friedman, who created the plan for an anti-Rooseveltian America; the politically expedient decisions of Richard Nixon that fueled inflation; the philosophy of Alan Greenspan, on whose libertarian ideology a house of cards was built on Wall Street; and Sandy Weill, who constructed the largest financial institution in the world, which would have gone bankrupt in 2008 without a federal bailout.--From publisher description.

The financial system consists of financial institutions and the market infrastructures that connect them. They are both key to the stability of the system as a whole. The basic assumption is that infrastructures function reliably, and their criticality is noticed only in the event of a disruption. Stability analysis should, therefore, increasingly extend its focus to include both the functioning of infrastructures and their interconnectedness with financial institutions..
"Financialization is one of the most innovative concepts to emerge in the field of political economy during the last three decades, although there is no agreement on what exactly it is. Profiting Without Producing puts forth a distinctive view defining financialization in terms of the fundamental conduct of non-financial enterprises, banks and households. Its most prominent feature is the rise of financial profit, in part extracted from households through financial expropriation. Financialized capitalism is also prone to crises, none greater than the gigantic turmoil that began in 2007. Using abundant empirical data, the book establishes the causes of the crisis and discusses the options broadly available for controlling finance"--
With a circulating credit currency, a modern national debt, and sophisticated financial markets, England developed a fiscal-military state that instilled fear and facilitated the first industrial revolution. Yet this new system of credit was precarious and prone to accidents, and it depended on trust, public opinion, and ultimately violence.

European financial markets and institutions
Contrary to most experience, Estonia (as well as Latvia and Lithuania) has been able to combine, for a number of years, fixed exchange rates, financial liberalisation (prior to proper supervision) and large current account deficits without inviting speculation using large capital flows as vehicles.The standard argument is that this must be due to exceptionally sound fundamentals and great policy credibility.Without challenging this argument either generally or for the case of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, this paper offers a supplementary perspective.These countries did not aim at developing a full-scale national economy with a full set of financial and other markets, as they had the possibility of joining an institutionally, culturally and geographically close set of North-Western European markets.Such a strategy goes further than having the goal of "rejoining Europe" as the external policy anchor.Having well-developed domestic markets can in some cases be substituted by accessing near-by markets, thus leaving little leeway to potentially unstable capital flows.This option, however, is not open to all, and it also has its downside. Key words: capital flows, exchange rate systems, institutional development, financial liberalisation, Baltic countries .
The devil's derivatives : the untold story of the slick traders and hapless regulators who almost blew up Wall Street
Finland's domestic financial system has continued to function well despite the prolonged recession. Short-term risks to the stability of the domestic financial system relate particularly to weaker-than-forecast developments in the Finnish economy and risks developing on the international financial markets..
Corporate financing and governance in Japan : the road to the future
"In an engaging style based on extensive research, Paper Money Collapse shows conclusively why paper money systems - monetary systems that are based on an elastic and constantly expanding supply of money (such as our system today) as opposed to a system of commodity money of essentially fixed supply - are inherently unstable and why they must lead to economic disintegration. All paper money systems in history ended in failure. The book shows why this must be the case and why it will also be the fate of the present system. The conclusions are controversial as they go against the present consensus, which holds that elastic state money is superior to inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard), and that expanding money is harmless or even beneficial for as long as inflation stays low. The book shows that the present crisis is the unavoidable result of continuously expanding fiat money, that the current policy of accelerated money production to 'stimulate' the economy is counterproductive and that, if pursued further, it will lead to a complete collapse of the monetary system.Paper money systems are confidence games. When the public realizes that the printing press is increasingly used to keep states and banks solvent, this confidence will evaporate quickly. The endgame will then be sovereign default, hyperinflation and economic chaos"--Provided by publisher.

This study examines development of the banking sectors in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from 1990 onwards.While institutional and legislative developments are discussed, the main emphasis is on the development of services provided by banks. The role of banks as intermediators of capital and as providers of a system of payments is generally seen as extremely important in achieving efficiency in market economies.Related to this view are the questions of how an economy in transition evolves successfully into a market economy as well as what effects the structure and performance of the banking sector have on the transition process.The Baltic cases provide a number of valuable insights in this regard. Banks in Baltic countries have developed fairly quickly and all have encountered a banking crisis of some magnitude.At the moment, Baltic banks can be said to fulfill at least part of their role as intermediators of capital.Also payment systems are now fairly well developed.However, it is fairly clear that the evolution of these banking sectors have a long way to go. Further reduction in the number of banks seems likely as most banks are still small, capital requirements have been raised, supervision is becoming tighter and competition among banks is increasing. Key words Banking, Baltic countries, banking supervision .
Financial market analysis
The financial sectors in the Baltic countries have developed quite rapidly over recent years and there are currently no immediate threats to their stability.However, the Baltic financial sectors are still below the level of development of the financial sectors in EU countries.The difference is remarkable both in the level of financing but also in the variety of instruments available in the markets.Even the banking sectors, which dominate the financing in the Baltic countries, are relatively small.The Baltic security markets are lagging behind the other EU accession countries and the development of that sector has been stagnant even during the recent period of growth. Key words: financial systems, banking, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania .

Threats to the stability of the euro area financial system relate to the risks to global economic growth - such as uncertainties around developments in China - and to the international financial markets. The profitability of the euro area banking sector has improved from the weak level witnessed previously, but the large amount of non-performing loans continues to weigh on banks' balance sheets. Risks to the Finnish financial system are associated with the weakness of the economy and household debt. In order to contain potential overheating on the housing loan market and household indebtedness, the authorities will need new additions to their toolbox..

Has banks' financial intermediation improved in Russia?
The economic adjustment programme for Portugal : first review : summer 2011
The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing importance of banks in the Russian economy over the period following the financial crisis of 1998. We use several measures to assess the role of banks in domestic financial intermediation in Russia. The traditional macro-level view is complemented by the analysis of sectoral financial flows as well as by insights from micro-level studies. All of these confirm that banks are becoming increasingly important in financial intermediation. We find that the scope and efficiency of intermediation by Russian banks has improved over time, but the level of banks' financial intermediation still lags behind other countries with similar levels of income. Possible explanations for this include the dual nature of Russian financial system.  Keywords: Russia, banks, financial intermediation, financial system .
