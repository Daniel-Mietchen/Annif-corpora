"Spectral Audio Signal Processing is the fourth book in the music signal processing series by Julius O. Smith. One can say that human hearing occurs in terms of spectral models. As a result, spectral models are especially useful in audio applications. For example, with the right spectral model, one can discard most of the information contained in a sound waveform without changing how it sounds. This is the basis of modern audio compression techniques."--Publisher's description.

This book provides a modern introduction to harmonic analysis and synthesis on topological groups. It serves as a guide to the abstract theory of Fourier transformation. For the first time, it presents a detailed account of the theory of classical harmonic analysis together with the recent developments in spectral analysis and synthesis. Selected problems and exercises will provide readers with a better understanding of the topics and some open problems may inspire further research.

"Bernard Helffer's graduate-level introduction to the basic tools in spectral analysis is illustrated by numerous examples from the Schr√∂dinger operator theory and various branches of physics: statistical mechanics, superconductivity, fluid mechanics and kinetic theory. The later chapters also introduce non self-adjoint operator theory with an emphasis on the role of the pseudospectra"--
