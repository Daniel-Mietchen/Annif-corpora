Critical readings in translation studies
Reflecting the recent and revolutionary changes in policy and practises affecting deaf people, this book is a resource that serves deaf people, nondeaf people, interpreters, educators, and the general public. Examine the past and present models of interpreting by taking a journey from the early days of interpreting to today's professionalization of interpreters. The goal of this book is to further the understanding of all stakeholders - to provide a basis from which you can determine your interests and needs in this area - and to help improve the quality of the interpreting process.

Attitudes, innuendo, and regulators : challenges of interpretation
No single book currently available in either the U.K. or the U.S. brings together such a blend of theory, research and practice in relation to the support of deaf students in higher education. The range of contributors, their national and international reputations in this field, and the innovative nature of the diverse materials gathered here will ensure this volumeÂ’s place as an indispensable resource. Focusing predominantly on the U.K., this book will also be relevant to a wider international audience in a field seeking to establish global networks. The model of support developing in the U.K. and described in these chapters, represents a significant shift in practice, from that founded on the now widely discredited medical perspective, to one reflecting a social framework. In the U.S., the catalyst for this change has been the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, whilst in the U.K., this shift is mirrored in the Disability Discrimination Act, 1995, most notably within Part IV (Special Educational Needs and Disability Act :2001, enforced 2002), which requires educational institutions to monitor entry, progression and outcomes for deaf students. In the wake of this, it is expected that deaf students will enter a wider range of institutions in increasing numbers. The consequent demand for these establishments to become inclusive, proactive, consultative and anticipatory in their support for deaf students will ensure that this book is welcomed as comprehensive and essential reading. With contributions from researchers and practitioners, and including personal testimony from undergraduate and postgraduate deaf students, this volume offers illuminating and fresh perspectives on the many elements of good practice and quality provision.
More than meets the eye : revealing the complexities of an interpreted education
The First Comprehensive Guide to Educational Interpreting As many as 22,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students are currently enrolled in local school programs where their access to the language of learning is dependent upon an interpreter. This book brings together comprehensive information about the practice of interpreting in educational settings. As the author points out, the field of educational interpreting has developed quickly in recent years, creating the need for this practical guide to serve as a resource for interpreters, general education teachers, special education teachers, special education directors, parents, speech-language pathologists, school administrators, and others concerned with the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The book takes a developmental approach to curriculum and instruction regarding students who use interpreters, moving from preschool on through the graduate school. The topics covered relate to the specific needs of learners at each age and apply to interpreters who use sign language, cued speech, and oral interpreting. Each section is presented in a question-answer format, with an emphasis on the challenges posed by interpreting in educational setting and the practices best suited to meeting those challenges. For each of the educational settings, engaging case studies focus on real-life situations and are followed by suggested best-practice solutions as well as questions for further thought.

The text introduces first-time users to sign language and how it affects interpreting and for those knowledgeable about sign language interpreting, it gathers together a wealth of previously scattered materials. For scholars and researchers, it directs their attention to new areas for study.
