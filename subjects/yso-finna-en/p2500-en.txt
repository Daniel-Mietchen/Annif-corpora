musculoskeletal diseases
"The sixth edition of Adams and Stashak's Lameness in Horses builds on the book's reputation as the classic gold-standard reference on equine lameness. Now in full color, the text has been fully revised and streamlined to improve user-friendliness, with a new, simplified format. Extraneous information has been deleted to refocus the book on diagnosing and managing lameness, and a valuable supplementary DVD provides a complete "How to" Guide for lameness diagnosis. The DVD contains additional anatomical images, video clips demonstrating key procedures such as physical examination, flexion tests, perineural and intrasynovial anesthesia, and examples of lameness conditions in motion. The sixth edition presents new or fully rewritten chapters on the axial skeleton, musculoskeletal disease and conditions, principles of therapy for lameness, occupation-related lameness conditions, and lameness in the young horse. The diagnostic procedures chapter has also been significantly expanded to reflect advances in this important area. Adams and Stashak's Lameness in Horses, Sixth Edition, is an essential addition to any equine practitioner's bookshelf"--Provided by publisher.
