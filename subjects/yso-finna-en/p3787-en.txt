The work on the thesis was conducted primarily during October–December 2012 as a final research part of a project launched in 2009 by the University Centre in Svalbard for collecting ice core from Lomonosovfonna and analyzing it for various persistent compounds. The research was focused on historic deposition of PCB compounds. Background information on PCBs (also in relation to the Arctic) as well as literature sources that are most relevant to the topic were included to this thesis. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were produced for industrial purposes between 1929 and 1993. The production declined in 1970s when their persistence and potential for bioaccumulation in the food chain had been recognized. PCBs are found all over the world, including Arctic areas, in water, soil, sediment, air, biota, and even in food products. By 2013, most countries in the world signed to eliminate PCBs from production, use and develop efficient remediation methods for PCB-rich waste and contaminated sites. The purpose of this thesis was to measure PCB contamination in snow and ice at high elevated glacier on Svalbard, Norway and analyse the historic atmospheric input of the contaminant to the Arctic. For that, a 37-meter deep ice core representing 1957–2009 and a snow sample of 2009–2010 were collected at the Lomonosovfonna glacier (78°49' 24.4" N; 17°25' 59.2"E) and analysed for all 209 PCB congeners. Ice core was divided into 6 – 12 years samples resulting in total 6 ice and 1 snow sample. The analysis for all PCB congeners revealed the dominance of tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls. The flux of total PCBs varied over the ice core. Maximum of about 18 pg cm-2 yr-1 was observed during years 1957–1966, 1974–1983, 1998–2009, and 2009–2010 which was lower when compared to samples from Canadian Arctic. The minimum flux was 5.75 pg cm-2 yr-1 in 1989–1998 period that happened after a 15 year decline since 1983. Besides, PCB-11 (3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl) was found in all the samples in the amounts of  0.9–4.5% of total PCBs. This congener was not present in the majority of commercial PCB products, and its source has not yet been well described.
