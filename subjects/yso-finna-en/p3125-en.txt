Anthropological perspectives on care : work, kinship, and the life-course
This practice-based philosophical study presents the view that professional healthcare is not just one of the many paid professions. On the contrary, healthcare should be redefined as a modest but meaningful variant of enacted love for one's fellow human beings, practiced in an institutional context. There is a reciprocal side to it, as it is not just professionals who show loving care for their patients, residents, or clients. Those groups have feelings of gratitude, respect and affinity for the professionals, although not all of them are equally satisfied. Obviously, love should be understood in a non-romantic and non-erotic way, and its location is not the private sphere. "Professional Loving Care" is the condensed and updated version of "Menslievende zorg", originally written within the context of the Low Countries, but dealing with issues that are relevant to western healthcare systems in general. The Dutch edition was published in 2005 and by 2011 it was in its sixth reprint.

This book offers a theological foundation for engaging with the realities of suffering and dying. Designed particularly for practical theology students and trainee caregivers, it introduces the spiritual and theological issues raised by suffering and dying. The chapters consider: how Christian theology deals with the problem of suffering and how the Bible treats these difficult issues post-biblical interpretations of Jesus' suffering and the Cross modern instances including ecology, poverty, discrimination and war comparative religious approaches and the depiction in popular culture. Natalie Weaver relates theology to practical issues of caregiving and provides a 'toolbox' for thinking about suffering and death in a creative and supportive way.

PSYCHOLOGY: EMOTIONS. In a divided world, empathy is not the solution, it is the problem; a source of prejudice, not kindness. We think of empathy - the ability to feel the suffering of others for ourselves - as the ultimate source of all good behaviour. But while it inspires care and protection in personal relationships, it has the opposite effect in the wider world. As the latest research in psychology and neuroscience shows, we feel empathy most for those we find attractive and who seem similar to us and not at all for those who are different, distant or anonymous. Empathy therefore biases us in favour of individuals we know while numbing us to the plight of thousands. Guiding us expertly through the experiments, case studies and arguments on all sides, Paul Bloom ultimately reveals that some of our worst decisions - in charity, child-raising, criminal justice, climate change and war - are motivated by this wolf in sheep's clothing.

The birthplace
The Nordic countries are now firmly ensconced in academia as gender-friendly welfare states. They are seen as pioneering countries with respect to changes in family life and gender relations and thus present an interesting forum for family research. This paper explores how gender caring relates to gender, religion and parenting in Sub-Saharan African families in the context of immigration to Finland. A constructionist perspective is employed to illuminate how guidelines or scripts established in these parents' cultures are actively used and how they in turn influence their gender relations. Gender caring is conceptualized as an ethic of reciprocity, solidarity and obligation to ensure interdependence and strong bonds among black African parents. The article draws on in-depth interviews conducted with twelve couples mainly in the Helsinki area (which includes Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen).
