"This new edition of Volume 2 of this series commences with an overview of the biochemistry, physiology, functions and utilisation of plant secondary metabolites, followed by detailed surveys of alkaloids and betalains, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and non-protein amino acids, phenyl propanoids and related compounds, and terpenoids (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, sterols, cardiac glycosides and steroid saponins). A chapter is also included covering the importance of secondary metabolites in taxonomy, as viewed from the perspective of molecular systematics." --NHBS Environment Bookstore.
