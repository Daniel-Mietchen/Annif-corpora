The main objective of this study is to clarify the current challenges and preconditions relating to product portfolio management (PPM) and widen the PPM framework over horizontal and vertical portfolios, including a related governance model, strategic performance management and the PPM process. This study analyses comprehensively the current PPM literature and the relevant practices of 10 case companies representing business areas such as hardware (HW), software (SW) and Services. This study approaches PPM from a more comprehensive viewpoint as all product life cycle phases and product structure levels are not covered well in this context by the earlier literature.The principal results of this study involve revealing the need for a new PPM governance model including strategic targets, KPIs and the PPM process according to vertical and horizontal portfolios. The created PPM framework clarifies the strategic role of PPM in cross-functional analysis and decision making for commercial and technical portfolios. The role and the impact of strategic PPM have been further enhanced by positioning the PPM process on the level of other business processes.The created PPM framework enhances the collaboration between business and engineering teams. The managerial implications include the potential preconditions of clarifying the dynamic and active role of PPM at the level of other business processes. The findings can aid business managers in understanding PPM as an entity that has a role in managing the entire product portfolio and its renewal based on strategic performance measures over horizontal and vertical portfolios according to cross-functional governance bodies. This highlights the criticality of managing all items both in commercial and technical portfolios. The role of other business processes should be highly operational by executing product development, marketing and sales, delivery and care activities according to PPM decisions. The primary role of PPM should be active management of the entire product portfolio over product life cycle phases and product structure levels, instead of merely focusing on new product development, to ensure product portfolio renewal.
Managing uncertainty in new product development projects for improved valuation and decision making is one of the most complex and challenging problems in operations management. It is important for any corporation depending on the success of new products and innovations. This work shows how uncertainty can be handled and partly resolved by conducting an information update during the development process. It is one of the first comprehensive models that combine statistical decision theory in form of Bayesian analysis with a real options framework for projects exposed to different sources of uncertainty. The proposed framework makes an important theoretical contribution in addressing this problem, while at the same time being of significant value to managers who face the difficult task of evaluating and managing complex product development projects.

Products have a significant and multidimensional role in business, whereas product management as a scientific field is still in its emergence. However, long industrial tradition positions product management as a holistic and complete business management of products at different levels throughout product lifecycles. The evolving business environment and external stakeholders influence the decision-making in product management. A commercially successful new product may necessitate as much as hundreds of new ideas and opportunities to be screened. Hence, decisions made in the front-end of product creation significantly affect the product cost and value throughout its lifecycle.This dissertation aims to answer the question of how product management can analyse stakeholders and business opportunities in a systematic way in the front-end of product creation. The study follows a qualitative research strategy and a constructive approach along the research process. Four original publications focus on stakeholder business opportunity analyses; the first one analyses external stakeholders as a business ecosystem for collaborative product creation; the second assesses the influence of internal stakeholders in product creation; whereas the third and fourth articles focus on systematic ways to conduct business case analyses during product creation.The systematic analysis of external stakeholders' business models is seen as a tangible way to perceive the business ecosystem. Salience assessment further helps to explain how the voice of stakeholders can be noticed by product management decision-making. Systemising the business case analysis procedure, including gathering, processing and integrating information from different knowledge and functional areas – customers, marketing, technical, financial and strategic – provides the rationale for product management to make well-informed go/no-go decisions and assurance for commitment towards funding and launching product creation projects.

Reliability, Maintainability, and Supportability play a crucial role in achieving a competitive product. While manufacturing costs are important for the success of a product, they are not the sole domains in realizing its competitive edge. Improved manufacturing and operating quality and performance coupled with reduced acquisition cost and in-service cost of ownership are important in achieving business success. It is the early phase of design which offers the greatest opportunity to address these requirements, and thus create life cycle effectiveness. The main objective of Reliability, Maintenance and Logistic Support - A Life Cycle Approach is to provide an integrated approach to reliability, maintainability, maintenance and logistic support analysis. We not only look at the ways we can improve the design process to ensure the product offers value for money, but we also consider how the owners can get the most from these products once they have entered service.The approach provides a meaningful way of integrating reliability, maintenance and supportability to enhance the product performance and sales opportunities. Hence, the book covers the following objectives: (1) Introduce the concepts of reliability, maintainability and supportability and their role in the system life cycle and effectiveness. (2) Introduce the basic probability and statistical techniques that are essential for modelling reliability, maintainability and supportability problems. (3) Introduce reliability measures: how to predict them; how to determine from in-service real-world data; how to use them. (4) Analysis of advanced models in Reliability. (5) Discuss basic and advanced concepts in both maintainability and maintenance including preventive, corrective and condition based maintenance. (6) Discuss maintenance management and optimization concepts, such as reliability-centered maintenance and age-related maintenance.(7) Provide basic concepts in supportability and Integrated logistic support. (8) Discuss techniques for design for reliability, maintainability and supportability. (9) Analysis of simple and advanced models in spares forecasting and optimization. (10) Discuss data analysis, data management and data mining techniques.
