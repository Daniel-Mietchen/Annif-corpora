"Schema therapy combines proven cognitive behaviour therapy techniques with elements of interpersonal, experiential and psychodynamic therapies in order to help people with long term mental health problems including personality disorders and chronic depression. Schema therapy suggests that many negative cognitive conditions are based on past experiences, and therefore provides models for challenging and modifying negative thoughts and behaviours in order to provoke change. In this book, Jeffrey Young, Eshkol Rafaeli, and David Bernstein - pioneers of the schema therapy approach - indicate the 30 distinctive features of schema therapy, and how the method fits into the broader CBT Spectrum. Divided into two sections The Distinctive Theoretical Features of Schema Therapy and The Distinctive Practical Features of Schema Therapy, this book will provide a concise introduction for those new to the technique, as well as a discussion of how it differs from the other cognitive behavioural therapies for those experienced in the field"--Provided by publisher.

Scheduling batch processes with MILP and evolutionary algorithms
The fourth edition of the late Lois Mai Chan's classic Cataloging and Classification covers the analysis and representation of methods used in describing, organizing, and providing access to resources made available in or through libraries. Resource Description and Access (RDA) is the new standard developed by the Library of Congress. With the help of the coauthor, Athena Salaba, this text is modified throughout to conform to the new standard. Retaining the overall outline of the previous edition, this text presents the essence of library cataloging and classification in terms of three basic functions: descriptive cataloging, subject access, and classification. This book is the standard text for the teaching and understanding of cataloging and classification.
