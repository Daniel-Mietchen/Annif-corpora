Summary: Consumption of anti-inflammatory analgesics: the effect of the switch to OTC.
The thesis concentrates on the consumer buying behaviour and product branding with semiotic and content analysing approaches. The study states consumer views according to a questionnaire and tries to understand the reasons behind Burana's strong market share among the Finnish OTC painkillers. Finnish consumers are well aware of the medications and their substitutes as well as the indications but lacking information on the side-effects. The results show there is need for Orion Pharma to either modernise their marketing with Burana, come up with something new or another brand might takeover the market share. There seems to be no imminent threat from Bayern with its Aspirin towards Orion Pharma's rule in the Finnish markets even though Aspirin is advertising strongly.
