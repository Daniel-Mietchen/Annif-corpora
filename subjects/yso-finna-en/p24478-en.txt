Sugden and Wade cover motor development and motor impairment, drawing on sources in medicine and health-related studies, motor learning and developmental psychology. A theme that runs through the book is that movement outcomes are a complex transaction of child resources, the context in which movement takes place, and the manner in which tasks are presented. The core themes of the book involve descriptions of motor development from conception through to emerging adulthood, explanations of motor development from differing theoretical, empirical, and experiential perspectives, and descriptions and explanations of atypical motor development when the resources of the child are limited in some way.

The Routledge Handbook of Motor Control and Motor Learning offers a survey of neurophysiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of motor function. Adopting an integrative approach, it examines the full range of key topics in contemporary human movement studies, explaining motor behaviour in depth from the molecular level to behavioural consequences. The book contains contributions from many of the world's leading experts in motor control and motor learning, and is composed of five thematic parts: Theories and models Basic aspects of motor control and learning Motor control and learning in locomotion and posture Motor control and learning in voluntary actions Challenges in motor control and learning Mastering and improving motor control may be important in sports, but it becomes even more relevant in rehabilitation and clinical settings, where the prime aim is to regain motor function. Therefore the book addresses not only basic and theoretical aspects of motor control and learning but also applied areas like robotics, modelling and complex human movements.
Growth-associated variation in body size, hormonal status, physical performance characteristics and perceptual-motor skills in Finnish young soccer players : a two-year follow-up study in the U11, U13 and U15 age groups
Motor control : theory and practical applications
To interact with the environment, an individual must code, store and translate spatial information into the appropriate motor commands. Working from this premise, this new book discusses how visual perception, attention and memory are linked to the processes of movement. As a resource for motor control and motor learning researchers, students, educators and clinicians, this book offers comprehensive coverage of current literature on the visual control of goal-directed movement. The book also presents a systematic explication of the sensory and physiological processes and systems responsible for fast, accurate and efficient performance. The final part of the text provides a review of recent research on how and why limb control changes occur with practice and development. In addition, the book considers how the research presented can maximise precision, efficiency and safety in workspace design.

The package includes batteries of tests for younger and older children, a developmental movement programme, and online access to INPP video training materials"-- Provided by publisher.
Lifelong motor development
Paediatric Biomechanics and Motor Control brings together the very latest developmental research using biomechanical measurement and analysis techniques and is the first book to focus on biomechanical aspects of child development. The book is divided into four main sections, looking at biological change during motor development; force production; the biomechanics of postural control and fundamental motor skills, and clinical applications of research into paediatric biomechanics and motor control. Written by a team of leading experts in paediatric exercise science, biomechanics and motor control from the UK, the US, Australia and Europe, the book is designed to highlight the key implications of this work for scientists, educators and clinicians. Each chapter is preceded by a short overview of the relevant biomechanical concepts and concludes with a summary of the practical and clinical applications in relation to the existing literature on the topic. This book is important reading for any sport or exercise scientist, health scientist, physical therapist, sports coach or clinician with an interest in child development or health.

Developmental Physical Education for All Children, now in its fifth edition, takes a student-focused, comprehensive approach in preparing future teachers to create programs that enable children to gain the knowledge, skills, and dispositions vital to leading a physically active lifestyle. Developmental Physical Education for All Children, Fifth Edition, features the following benefits: - Shows teachers how to translate child development theory and research from the psychomotor, cognitive, affective, and fitness domains into practice - Offers teachers the understanding they need to create developmentally appropriate lessons that align with the new SHAPE America National Standards for Physical Education with grade-level outcomes, assessments, and instructions on implementing learning goals for students in pre-K through grade 5 - Provides multiple standards-based movement experiences for pre-K through grade 5 learners that include movement tasks and extensions, scaled learning environments, skill cues, practice strategies, teaching style choices, and formative assessments aligned with goals - Supplies learning goal blueprints that integrate specialized skills, movement concepts, and tactics for developmental games, dance, and gymnastics.
"Success in sport depends upon the athlete's ability to develop and perfect a specific set of perceptual, cognitive and motor skills. Now in a fully revised and updated new edition, Skill Acquisition in Sport examines how we learn such skills and, in particular, considers the crucial role of practice and instruction in the skill acquisition process. Containing thirteen completely new chapters, and engaging with the significant advances in neurophysiological techniques that have profoundly shaped our understanding of motor control and development, the book provides a comprehensive review of current research and theory on skill acquisition. Leading international experts explore key topics such as: attentional focus augmented Feedback observational practice and learning implicit motor learning mental imagery training physical guidance motivation and motor learning neurophysiology development of skill joint action. Throughout, the book addresses the implications of current research for instruction and practice in sport, making explicit connections between core science and sporting performance. No other book covers this fundamental topic in such breadth or depth, making this book important reading for any student, scholar or practitioner working in sport science, cognitive science, kinesiology, clinical and rehabilitation sciences, neurophysiology, psychology, ergonomics or robotics"-- Provided by publisher.

"Now in its Eighth Edition, this topically organized text provides a comprehensive introduction to lifespan motor development and includes the most current research findings available in the field. The text takes a lifespan approach to development, with thorough coverage of prenatal, childhood, adolescent, and adult development. Theoretical concepts are conveyed through language appropriate for undergraduate students. This is the only lifespan motor development text that presents both the component approach and the total body approach for analyzing the basic fundamental and object control skills of childhood"--

The book is organised to first introduce the reader to the field: how it emerged, the questions that interest people in the field, how they go about trying to answer those questions and potential career options. The second part of the book explains how the study of motor behaviour is concerned with the interactions between the environment, the task and the person executing the actions. It goes on to demonstrate how the knowledge resulting from this research can be applied to improve performance in a variety of settings. Finally, the epilogue asks a series of 'what will you do?' questions to prompt readers to consider how he or she might eventually contribute to the field. It shows: techniques to observe and classify motor behaviour and to identify performance demands; how people control movements; how people learn motor skills; capabilities and limitations that each person brings to a particular task; and how to use the motor skill learning cycle to design and modify instructional programmes. It includes detailed descriptions of the various types of practice available, including when each might prove to be a good choice.
