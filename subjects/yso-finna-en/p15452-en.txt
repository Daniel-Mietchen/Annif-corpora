A Practical Guide to Teaching Music in the Secondary School provides valuable support, guidance and creative ideas for student teachers, mentors and practising teachers who want to develop their music teaching. Written to accompany the successful textbook Learning to Teach Music in the Secondary School , it will help you understand important current developments and explore new possibilities for teaching and learning. Focusing on teaching music musically, the book explores musical learning through placing pupils at the centre of a musical experience. Considering the revised KS3 curriculum and the 14-19 agenda in music, it also seeks to broaden the perspectives of music teachers through engaging with collaborative practice, transitions and cross-curricular work. Key issues explored include: personalising musical learning, teaching creatively and promoting creativity, approaches to using ICT in the classroom, musical collaboration with other adults assessment for learning in music making, and connections with other subjects. Using practical examples and tasks, this book will help you critically examine the way in which children learn music.
