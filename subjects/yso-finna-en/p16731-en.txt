Elevated concentrations of certain heavy metals: cadmium, lead, nickel, zink, copper, manganese and iron, were recorded from surface sediments close to two fish-farms at Nåtö, as were the concentrations of cadmium in liver, kidney, spleen and bile, of lead in kidney and spleen, of nickel in kidney and spleen, of zink in liver, kidney, gonads, spleen, of copper in liver, gonads, spleen, of manganese in kidney and gonads, of iron in spleen, of flounder, from Nåtö. For turbot only the concentrations of cadmium and copper in the kidneys, and of zink in gonads were noteworthy. In the soft tissue of Baltic clay-mussel elevated concentrations of cadmium were recorded from Nåtö Biological Station, lead, zink, copper, and iron, from both the station and the mouth of the former Nåtö sewage pipeline. Elevated concentrations of cadmium were recorded from soft tissue of blue-mussel from the Föglö fairway (close to the Föglö fish-farm), and from Kobbaklintar light-house island, where also the concentrations of manganese were notable, as were lead in mussels from the Nåtö Biological Station. Also for the cockle-mussel the concentrations of cadmium were elevated at Nåtö Biological Station. All flounders, however, were safe for e.g. human consumption.

"Media work is a good example of working life in modern 24/7 society. Time pressure and cognitive strain due to overflow of media inputs enhance job strain. New technology requires constant learning and implementation of new working modalities. Employees might continue work-related activities at home and outside the workplace. This may lead to overcommitment and extension of the real working time. Irregular shift work is common. Sudden changes in information flow, technical problems and alterations in team resources may hinder recovery and increase stress. On the other hand high demands may increase the well-being, if the worker can use the skills and has good job control. Self-assessments of stress and well-being combined with physiological measurements help us also to identify work-related and personal factors that could explain good or poor recovery." -- (Back Cover)

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases affect many people in Finland. One way to support this patient group is patient education. Since the time spent in the inpatient settings is limited, treatment and education of cardiovascular patients is currently focused mainly on the outpatient settings. This creates pressure for the nurses due to the strict time-frame and high turnover of patients. The purpose of this final project was to find evidence-based knowledge on the patient education of a cardiac patient and to implement a nursing journal club. The research questions were when and how the education for heart patients should be conducted. This final project was done in co-operation with the cardiac outpatient clinic in the University Hospital of Helsinki where the collected knowledge was presented in four journal club sessions. Data collection was done following the basics of literature review and by conducting multiple database searches. A more in-depth analysis was conducted once five most relevant articles were found. These five articles were presented to the nursing staff of cardiac outpatient clinic in Meilahti during May 2011. The issues presented in the nursing journal clubs were focused on the learning needs of cardiac patients, different kinds of patient education methods and the psychological path-way of a patient suffering from a cardiovascular illness. The focus was on going through the results of each article and discussing them together with the nurses. Based on the discussion, it became clear that most crucial points that rose from the articles chosen were taking patient's individual needs into consideration and the importance of consistent planning and documenting care.
