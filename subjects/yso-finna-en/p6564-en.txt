Sixteen-year-old Mackie Doyle knows that he replaced a human child when he was just an infant, and when a friend's sister disappears he goes against his family's and town's deliberate denial of the problem to confront the beings that dwell under the town, tampering with human lives. â€“ WorldCat.

Our societies are ageing. The Family is changing. Labour force behaviour is evolving. How is the organisation of family and collective solidarity adapting in this context of longer life spans, low fertility, and work that is simultaneously scarce and abundant? The welfare states are currently facing three main challenges: ensure satisfactory living conditions for the elderly without increasing the cost burden on the active population, reduce social inequality, and maintain equity between successive generations. In this book, researchers from different countries compare their experiences and offer contrasting views on the future of social protection. They consider the theoretical aspects of the intergenerational debate, relations between generations within the family, the living standards of elderly people, and the question of social time.

The book Asian Public Theology is inspired by the vision that the response to the multifarious problems facing this continent needs a reflection in public along with many partners; it may not be responded to by conventional or dominant theologies pursued within narrow confines. This book takes up issues of public concern in Asia, examines them with the help of many disciplines and reflects on them in the light of the humanistic vision and values of Christian message. It is a theology that is open to all religious traditions and secular ideologies which are also challenged by the critical issues of this continent. At a time when more and more people are drawn into the null spaces of social insensitivity and seduced by the glitz and glamour of globalisation and its consumerism, public theology as a critical intervention, takes on a prophetic character. Asian Public Theology acknowledges the agency of the subalterns, affirms their ethical sense, inspires courage and evokes hope in them to build a different Asia. This book also discusses the human and ethical responsibility of all to take up the cause of the marginalised.

Good customer service is vital for small tourism businesses. Customer service should aim at providing customers satisfying experiences, as satisfied customers are likely to associate with the company in the future; they are the foundation of all business. Small tourism businesses have a benefit over the large ones, as it is easier for smaller companies to respond to the individual clients' and varying customer groups' wishes and demands than it is for larger companies.    Challenging customer service situations are met in all industries. There is some general guidance on how to deal with these situations; listening, asking defining questions and showing concern towards the customer. The use of body language and reading the silent messages that the customer is giving out are also important. Good customer service person will already have excellent social skills, but these skills can also be learned or gained through work or training. No customer should leave the business dissatisfied; even if the customer is acting threateningly or is wrong.    The assignment for the thesis was set by the Tourism Team group, which operates under the Rural Police Committee. Eight small tourism businesses in Oulu area took part in the study that was conducted by themed interviews. The study findings mostly agree with the theory; this was not surprising as challenging customer service situations are a fairly widely studied topic in customer service literature.    As a result of the study, 10 cases of challenging customer service situations in small tourism businesses were produced; they will be used at the Service with a heart -trainings, which are run by the Tourism Theme group.

This edited collection was produced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the journal Comparative Education, one of the most established and prestigious journals in the field. Each chapter was written by a leading scholar of comparative and international education. The collection marks a creative and critical engagement with some of the most important topics in contemporary comparative education, including 'big data', pedagogy, adult education, scholarly mobility, and gender. The theme of 'silences' connects the papers: while comparative education covers the breadth and depth of educational concerns, it has its own obsessions, but which themes do not receive the attention they deserve? This book will be of interest to anyone interested in the theory, method and practice of comparative education today or in its development over the past 50 years. It will be informative to all scholars and graduate students concerned with education in its global contexts. In addition, to those readers who situate themselves within the field of comparative and international education, it offers a unique perspective on this important area of inquiry and the activities, preoccupations, absences and communities within it. This book was originally published as a special issue of Comparative Education.

Saving energy to protect the nature, but monitoring to reduce the bill : experiences from Adjutantti
Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to find out what challenges Finns face in adaptation to working life in Turkey. The objective of the thesis was to understand Turkish and Finnish cultures and by comparing them to find out possible challenges that a Finnish employee might face in Turkish working environment.  The theoretical section of this thesis includes a comparison of various cultural features according to Hofstede's dimensions and a comparison of Finland's and Turkey's working cultures according to Lewis' model. The information for the theoretical part was mostly based on literature of expatrium process and on cultural studies of Finland and Turkey. By utilizing these theories, the empirical part deals with practical examples that are based on the experiences of ten Finns who have moved to Turkey. In the theoretical part differences in hierarchical, collectivistic and in concept of time issues were found, which can be seen in the Finns' experienced challenges of adaptation. In Turkish and Finnish working life the approach is similar, but Finland's and Turkey's working cultures appreciate partly different features in subordinates.  The empirical part focuses on Finnish interviewees' experiences in Turkish working life. The purpose was to find out the challenges Finns have faced by comparing cultures and working life of these two countries. The empirical part is handled closely with the theoretical parts of this thesis so that they can easily be compared. Information for the empirical section was gathered through ten interviews of Finns who have several years of experience in working and living in Turkey. The interviewees confirmed that Turkish language, bureaucracy and a different concept of time were the most challenging aspects for a Finn in Turkish working environment. The interviewees told that their own attitude and understanding of the cultural differences helped them in the adaptation process. The conclusion part deals with the main themes of this research and presents some recommendations on studying the culture, familiarizing with local ideology, and learning the basics of the language.

Religious education in a world of religious diversity
"The landscape of workplace learning is transforming. Organizations today understand that formal training is not always the best solution in the fast changing world of innovation and new technology. The rise of social and informal learning, gamification of training, dealing with big data and creating value within the supply chain are just some challenges L&D professionals face in their work today.The Learning Challenge helps practitioners make sense of the latest developments in this area and their impact on the learning function in their organization. With the help of case studies and interviews from a range of high profile practitioners, the author defines the role of the new learning leader and illuminates the practical implications for creating and implementing a learning strategy for the 21st century"--
