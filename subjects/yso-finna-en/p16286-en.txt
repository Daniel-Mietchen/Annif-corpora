Gone tomorrow : the hidden life of garbage
This study will discuss the recycling behaviour among students who live in student residences provided by the University of Abertay Dundee (UAD) in the city of Dundee, Scotland. Background to the topic is introduced with facts about the waste management procedures in Europe and in Scotland and the issues that arise from waste in order to explain the reader why this particular subject was thought to be important and thus why it was chosen. The questionnaire used in the survey will also be introduced as well as its design and the questions, in order to explain what exactly was wanted from the questionnaire. The relationship between habits in the past and future behaviour is observed, as well as the correlation between attitudes and intentions. The results and analysis from the questionnaire are discussed later on in the Results and Analysis section. Suggestions to future actions are also introduced as well as the conclusions.
