This book is written for researchers and students interested in the function and role of chemical elements in biological or environmental systems. Experts have long known that the Periodic System of Elements (PSE) provides only an inadequate chemical description of elements of biological, environmental or medicinal importance. This book explores the notion of a Biological System of the Elements (BSE) established on accurate and precise multi-element data, including evolutionary aspects, representative sampling procedures, inter-element relationships, the physiological function of elements and uptake mechanisms. The book further explores the concept Stoichiometric Network Analysis (SNA) to analyze the biological roles of chemical species. Also discussed is the idea of ecotoxicological identity cards which give a first-hand description of properties relevant for biological and toxicological features of a certain chemical element and its geo biochemically plausible speciation form. The focus of this book goes beyond both classical bioinorganic chemistry and toxicology.

"Chemical, Biological, and Functional Aspects of Food Lipids provides a concise, straightforward treatment of the present state of knowledge of the nomenclature, content, composition, occurrence, distribution, chemical and biological reactivity, functional properties, and biological role of lipids in food systems. Written by a team of international researchers and based on the available world literature, this book examines the nature, technological properties, reactivity, and health-related concerns and benefits of food lipids. It covers the effects of storage and processing conditions on all aspects of quality of lipid-containing foods and reviews the current state of techniques for lipid analysis. The volume also discusses the importance of lipids in the human diet and includes a comparison of dietary recommendations for lipid intake. This is a valuable reference for researchers and graduate students in food chemistry and nutrition"--
