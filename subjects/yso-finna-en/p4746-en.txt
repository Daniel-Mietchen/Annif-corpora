This self-contained monograph focuses on recent important developments in the study of random fields, stochastic processes defined over high dimensional parameter spaces. While it replaces Adler's 1981 classic, "The Geometry of Random Fields", this is not an update, but a completely new work with a completely new way of handling both the geometry and the probability that are its central themes.There are three quite distinct parts to the monograph. Part I provides a comprehensive background to the general theory of Gaussian random fields, treating classical topics such as continuity and boundedness, entropy and majorising measures, Borell and Slepian inequalities. The treatment is didactic and user-friendly. Part II is about Geometry, both integral and Riemannian, and the material included here is what is needed for the over-riding probabilistic theme of the book. It contains a quick review of both these geometric settings, followed by carefully presented introductions to topics such as Crofton formulae, curvature measures for stratified manifolds, critical point theory and tube formulae. This is the only place in which all these topics, necessary for the study of random fields can be found in a concise, self-contained, treatment. The most important part of the book is in Part III, which is about the geometry of excursion sets of random fields and the related - Euler characteristic approach - to extremal probabilities. This part contains path-breaking material of both theoretical and practical importance and is unique in the way in which it intertwines probabilistic and geometric problems. Applications of this theory, which are significant and cover areas as widespread as brain imaging, physical oceanography and astrophysics, will be treated in a separate volume with Keith Worsley. This monograph will be of interest to probabilists and statisticians, both applied and theoretical, along with mathematicians interested in learning about new relationships between geometry and probability. It is also a basic reference text for those who will eventually be interested mainly in the companion volume of applications. Given the clear and pedagogical style of the book and the current importance of research in random fields, this comprehensive and definitive work will serve as an indispensable reference work, while at the same time being an excellent text for self study and graduate courses in probability, statistics, analysis and geometry.

"This book is an introduction to probability theory covering laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, random walks, martingales, Markov chains, ergodic theorems, and Brownian motion. It is a comprehensive treatment concentrating on the results that are the most useful for applications. Its philosophy is that the best way to learn probability is to see it in action, so there are 200 examples and 450 problems"--

"Mathematicians have found it useful to enumerate all sorts of things arising in discrete mathematics: elements of finite groups, configurations of ones and zeros, graphs of various sorts; the list is endless. Analytic combinatorics uses analytic techniques to do the counting: generating functions are defined and their coefficients are then estimated via complex contour integrals. This book is the result of nearly fifteen years work on developing analytic machinery to recover, as effectively as possible, asymptotics of the coefficients of a multivariate generating function. It is the first book to describe many of the results and techniques necessary to estimate coefficients of generating functions in more than one variable"--

"Derived from extensive teaching experience in Paris, this second edition now includes over 100 exercises in probability. New exercises have been added to reflect important areas of current research in probability theory, including infinite divisibility of stochastic processes, past-future martingales and fluctuation theory. For each exercise the authors provide detailed solutions as well as references for preliminary and further reading. There are also many insightful notes to motivate the student and set the exercises in context"--Provided by publisher.

On the mathematical foundations of probability
"Discover how maths can explain and predict the vagaries of chance. Imagine this: you are browsing used books in a bookstore hundreds of miles from home when you come across a copy of Moby Dick, which you remember reading as a child. You open it and find your own name on the inside cover. What are the chances? This is the question we ask ourselves upon encountering seemingly impossible coincidences, like the woman who won the lottery four times. But from clairvoyants to financial markets, and from unique scientific discoveries to DNA evidence, if there is any likelihood that something could happen, no matter how small, it is bound to happen to someone at some time. Coupling lively anecdotes with the principles of probability, Joseph Mazur balances the fun of a great coincidence with the logical thinking of a mathematician. With a lightness of touch and a witty turn of phrase, Mazur sweeps aside pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, proving that there are rational explanations for even the most extraordinary events."--Allen & Unwin website.

"Preface Starting with the fundamentals of probability, this text leads readers to computer simulations and Monte Carlo methods, stochastic processes and Markov chains, queuing theory, statistical inference, and regression. These areas are heavily used in modern computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, and related fields. For whom this book is written The book is primarily intended for junior undergraduate to beginning graduate level students majoring in computer-related fields - computer science, software engineering, information systems, information technology, telecommunications, etc. At the same time, it can be used by electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, natural science, and other majors for a standard calculus-based introductory statistics course. Standard topics in probability and statistics are covered in Chapters 1-4 and 8-9. Graduate students can use this book to prepare for probability-based courses such as queuing theory, artificial neural networks, computer performance, etc. The book can also be used as a standard reference on probability and statistical methods, simulation, and modeling tools"--
