Partial magic : the novel as a self-conscious genre
Parasite rex : inside the bizarre world of nature's most dangerous creatures
Host manipulation by parasites : adaptation to enhance transmission?
Ecology and evolution of parasitism : hosts to ecosystems
"Biogeography has renewed its concepts and methods following important recent advances in phylogenetics, macroecology, and geographic Information systems. In parallel, the evolutionary ecology of most-parasite interactions has attracted the interest of numerous studies dealing with life-history traits, evolution, community ecology, and evolutionary epidemiology." "The Biogeography of Host-Parasite Interactions is the first book to integrate these two fields, using examples from a variety of host-parasite associations in various regions, and across both ecological and evolutionary timescales. Besides a strong theoretical component, there is a bias towards applications, specifically in the fields of historical biogeography, palaeontology, phylogeography, landscape epidemiology, invasion biology, conservation biology, human evolution, and health ecology. A particular emphasis concerns emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases linked to global changes." "This accessible text is intended for graduate students, professional researchers, and practitioners in the fields of evolutionary ecology, parasitology, biogeography, and conservation biology, as well as a broader audience from geography, epidemiology, and veterinary medicine"--BOOK JACKET---
