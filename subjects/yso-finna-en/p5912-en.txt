"Psychology of Sustainability: An Applied Perspective examines the many psychological factors that lead to human behavioral effects on the environment. Because applied psychology is concerned with defining criteria and finding precursor variables that can be manipulated, this textbook is neatly structured to represent the principles of applied psychology. Each chapter will apply elements from a basic research area into the context of criteria specific to sustainability. Until recently, applied psychology received minimal attention from professors and professionals in sustainability. At the same time, increased interest has led many universities to offer courses on "Psychology of Sustainability." This book is the perfect text to provide an introduction to the subject. Throughout the book, readers will find new ways of framing questions related to human adaptability and evolutionary psychology. Psychology of Sustainability is ideal for students or professionals who are looking to contribute to the conversation"--

"A Selection of the Library of Science, History, and Military Book Clubs  "One of the finest science writers I've ever read." -Los Angeles Times  "Ellard has a knack for distilling obscure scientific theories into practical wisdom." -New York Times Book Review  "[Ellard] mak[es] even the most mundane entomological experiment or exegesis of psychological geekspeak feel fresh and fascinating." -NPR  "Colin Ellard is one of the world's foremost thinkers on the neuroscience of urban design. Here he offers an entirely new way to understand our cities-and ourselves." -CHARLES MONTGOMERY, author of Happy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design  Our surroundings can powerfully affect our thoughts, emotions, and physical responses, whether we're awed by the Grand Canyon or Hagia Sophia, panicked in a crowded room, soothed by a walk in the park, or tempted in casinos and shopping malls. In Places of the Heart, Colin Ellard explores how our homes, workplaces, cities, and nature-places we escape to and can't escape from-have influenced us throughout history, and how our brains and bodies respond to different types of real and virtual space. As he describes the insight he and other scientists have gained from new technologies, he assesses the influence these technologies will have on our evolving environment and asks what kind of world we are, and should be, creating.  Colin Ellard is the author of You Are Here: Why We Can Find Our Way to the Moon, but Get Lost in the Mall. A cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo and director of its Urban Realities Laboratory, he lives in Kitchener, Ontario. "--
