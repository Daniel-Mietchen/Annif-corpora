The clash between protection of personal data and protection of intellectual property rights in the CJUE jurisprudence
"This book examines the birth of the European individual as a juridical problem. Focusing on six legal case dossiers from the European Court of Justice which, doctrinally, concern the legitimacy of states derogation from the free-movement rights of workers the book treats these as an electrifying laboratory for the study of law and society The concrete individuals whose cases the book analyses are a scientologist, a dangerous gunman, a provocative trade-unionist, a rogue pimp, a drug dealer, and two prostitutes. These delinquent individuals each expelled from one of the Member States thus provide the raw material for constructing the idea of the European individual. Foucaults story of the modern subject constitutes the books main theoretical inspiration, as it considers the encounter between legal and other practices within a more general field of juridical power: a network of active relations, between different social spheres. The European individual, it is argued, emerged out of this field and its practices of knowledge power at the intersection of regimes of law, economy and security. "

The aim of the research is to identify what result brings the balancing between the protection of personal data and the protection of intellectual property rights undertaken by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its recent jurisprudence. The research should explain three main questions: first, why the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses belong to the personal data. Second, if it would be legitimate to place the liability for identifying and blocking the IPR infringements on the internet service providers only Third, what is the rationale for the position of the CJEU not to accept such claims of IPR holders. The author searches to find out whether the CJEU jurisprudence indicates that there is a certain hierarchy between data protection and IPR protection..
