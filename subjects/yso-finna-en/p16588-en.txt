Mary Aiken is the world s leading expert in forensic cyberpsychology a discipline that combines psychology, criminology, and technology to investigate the intersection where technology and human behavior meet. In this, her first book, Aiken has created a starting point for all future conversations about how the Internet is shaping development and behavior, societal norms and values, children, safety, security, and our perception of the world. Cyberspace is an environment full of surveillance, but who is looking out for us? The Cyber Effect offers a fascinating and chilling look at a future we can still do something about. Drawing on her own research and extensive experience with law enforcement, Mary Aiken covers a wide range of subjects from the impact of screens on the developing child to the explosion of teen sexting, and the acceleration of compulsive and addictive behaviors online (gaming, shopping, pornography). She examines the escalation of cyberchondria (anxiety produced by self-diagnosing online), cyberstalking, and organized cybercrime in the Deep Web. Aiken provides surprising statistics and incredible-but-true case studies of hidden trends that are shaping our culture and raising troubling questions about where the digital revolution is taking us. The Cyber Effect will upend your assumptions about your online life and forever change the way you think about the technology you, your friends, and family use. Readers will gain a new understanding of the rapid change taking shape around us and come away with critical tools to become part of this very necessary conversation.

Design plays an increasingly larger role today in creating consumer desire for products and liking for commercial messages. However, the psychological processes involved are only partially understood. In addition, design is inherently interdisciplinary, involving (among others) important elements of aesthetics, anthropology, brand strategy, creativity, design science, engineering, graphic design, industrial design, marketing, material science, product design, and several areas within psychology.
Human performance and ergonomics
"Preface This book focuses on a positive emotional approach in product, service, and system design and emphasizes aesthetics and enjoyment in user experience. This book provides dissemination and exchange of scientific information on the theoretical and practical areas of affective and pleasurable design for research experts and industry practitioners from multidisciplinary backgrounds, including industrial designers, emotion designer, ethnographers, human-computer interaction researchers, human factors engineers, interaction designers, mobile product designers, and vehicle system designers. This book is organized in nine sections which focus on the following subjects: I: Designing for Diversity II: Cultural and Traditional Aspects III: Ergonomics and Human Factors IV: Product, Service, and System Design V: Human Interface in Product Design VI: Emotion and UX Design VII: Design and Development Methodology VIII: Diverse Approaches: Biosignals, Textiles, and Clothing IX: Novel Devices, Information Visualization, and Augmented Reality Sections I through III of this book cover special approaches in affective and pleasurable design with emphasis on diversity, cultural and traditional contexts, and ergonomics and human factors. Sections IV through VII focus on design issues in product, service, and system development, human interface, emotional aspect in UX, and methodological issues in design and development. Sections VIII and IX handle emotional design approaches in diverse areas, i.e. biosignals, textiles, and clothing, and emerging technologies for human interaction in smart computing era. Overall structure of this book is organized to move from special interests in design, design and development issues, to novel approaches for emotional design. "--

"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

""The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses" shows that the same basic principles of psychology that work for board games, card games and athletic games also are the keys to making top-quality video games. Good game design happens when you view your game from many different perspectives, or lenses. While touring through the unusual territory that is game design, this book gives the reader one hundred of these lenses - one hundred sets of insightful questions to ask yourself that will help make your game better. These lenses are gathered from fields as diverse as psychology, architecture, music, visual design, film, software engineering, theme park design, mathematics, writing, puzzle design, and anthropology. Anyone who reads this book will be inspired to become a better game designer - and will understand how to do it"--Resource description page.
