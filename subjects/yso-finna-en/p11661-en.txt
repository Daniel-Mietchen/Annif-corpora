religious magazines
The Christian Century is widely regarded as the most influential religious magazine in America for most of the twentieth century. Coffman traces its chronic financial struggles, evolving editorial positions, and often fractious relations among writers, editors, and readers. Until the late 1940s, the magazine spoke out about many of the most pressing social and political issues of the time; but by the 1950s, internal strife shattered the illusion of Protestant consensus.
