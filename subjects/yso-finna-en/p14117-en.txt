"This book examines the struggle of the European Union bureaucracy to maintain its autonomy in an increasingly complex institutional setting and adverse political environment. Using an original survey of nearly two hundred top European Commission officials, it shows that the European Union is a coherent organization that shares a common culture of supranationalism. The European Union's multicephalous structure of political authority limits the capacity of European politicians to curb the autonomy of the Commission but tends to undermine the legitimacy of the organization, which finds itself under persistent political attacks. These attacks inadvertently help the organization bolster its defenses against the external threats and trigger internal legitimation processes that reinforce the devotion of its employees to its institutional mission. The rich survey data show how Commission bureaucrats establish themselves as the "custodians of Europe." The book helps disentangle the complexity of the Commission and makes a contribution to the study of international bureaucracies, a topic that has received little attention"--

European diary, 1977-1981
This public health analysis examines the supporting documentation for the formulation and implementation of the European Commission's 2006 Communication on a strategy to reduce alcohol-based harm (the Communication) and the framework for alcohol policy in the WHO European Region (the framework), in order to provide guidance for the development of country-based action plans on alcohol. This report also examines relevant findings from projects co-financed by the Commission. The analysed materials call for strong, coordinated action across all relevant policy domains to reduce alcohol-related harm, supported by national action plans and backed by the European Union (EU). The Communication, an action-oriented instrument, focuses on mapping present actions and sharing experiences, whereas the framework, a process-oriented instrument, calls for national infrastructure to implement effective action. In implementing the Communication, the Commission has focused on education, young people's drinking and industry self-regulation. Actions in other EU policy domains have not yet contributed to reducing the health and economic burden of alcohol use. National action plans should complement implementation of the Communication and the framework by emphasizing actions that regulate alcohol price, availability and marketing, which will have an immediate impact on reducing alcohol's burden.
