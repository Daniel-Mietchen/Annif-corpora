The impact of values
"The emergence of Green parties throughout Europe during the 1980s marked the arrival of a new form of political movement, which challenged established models of party politics. However, since the 'Green wave' of the 1980s, these parties have struggled to solidify their electoral successes in the face of stern opposition and strategic political reaction from mainstream political parties." "The Evolution of Green Politics is the first study of the future direction of the European Green parties. It presents an in-depth, thematic and comparative approach to the analysis of recent Green party development, questioning whether the process of party evolution has resulted in the ideological dilution of Green ideals and objectives."--BOOK JACKET.
