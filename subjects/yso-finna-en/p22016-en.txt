Marriage migration and skills : narratives of Latvian women in Finland
Cultural competence in health promotion and experienced by the Kurdish women in Finland
This volume examines the implications and consequences of the idea of 'intangible heritage' to current international academic and policy debates about the meaning and nature of cultural heritage and the management processes developed to protect it. It provides an accessible account of the different ways in which intangible cultural heritage has been defined and managed in both national and international contexts, and aims to facilitate international debate about the meaning, nature and value of not only intangible cultural heritage, but heritage more generally. "Intangible Heritage" fills a significant gap in the heritage literature available and represents a significant cross section of ideas and practices associated with intangible cultural heritage.The authors brought together for this volume represent some of the key academics and practitioners working in the area, and discuss research and practices from a range of countries, including: Zimbabwe, Morocco, South Africa, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, USA, Brazil and Indonesia, and bring together a range of areas of expertise which include anthropology, law, heritage studies, archaeology, museum studies, folklore, architecture, Indigenous studies and history.

Introducing the concept of the experience-based capital of physical exercise (ECPE)
For people who come from other countries to live in Finland, the impact of settlement and acculturation varies widely depending on their experience and situation. There are many determinants of health and well-being from outside of the health system. Finland is becoming more responsive to the needs of people from diverse backgrounds. This research explains in general the plight of the Kurdish women having immigrated into Finland. A woman's position in this society is slow to change. These women have experienced various factors in their everyday lives such as patriarchy, political issues, different environments, diff erent languages and cultures. In this research I have shown that those factors directly and indirectly infl uence the Kurdish woman in Finland's health situation. I have likewise proposed a project plan in order to solve these problems. The findings of this research study could be used for planning of the methods in the health promotion project, developing personal health promotion skills of the Central Council for Health Education and Promotion for Kurdish immigrant women..
