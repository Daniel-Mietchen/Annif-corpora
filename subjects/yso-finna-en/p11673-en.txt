The main cause of temperature and composition fluctuations in the electric arc furnace (EAF) process is the scrap used as a raw material. Process conditions in EAF can vary significantly from heat to heat because there is no accurate information of scrap composition. Due to harsh process conditions, there are currently few sensors available for direct on-line measurement of the EAF process.In this work new information about stainless steelmaking EAF process conditions is sought with optical emission spectrum measurement. The measurement system relies on transportation of the light emitted from the measured furnace to a remotely situated spectrometer.Analysing the slag composition from the arc emission spectrum was tested in the laboratory and on a pilot scale. The laboratory measurements indicate that changes in the amount of CrOx and MnO in the slag have the highest impact on optical emission spectra. The pilot scale measurements show that the Cr2O3 content of the slag can be measured from the arc emission spectrum using suitable reference lines with an average absolute error of 0.62 %-points and a standard deviation of 0.49 %-points.The results from measurements at Outokumpu Stainless Oy, Tornio Works, indicate that measurement of the optical emission spectrum from industrial EAF is feasible in a practical sense, and can be used in analysing of EAF atmosphere, scrap melting and slag surface. Furthermore, the results of industrial measurements indicate that the atoms in the arc plasma mainly originate from the slag. The measurement of scrap melting could be potentially used in EAF control in optimization of arc voltages and second scrap bucket charging. The potential use of slag CrOx measurements is in optimization of reductant additions as well as defining the further processing of EAF slag.
