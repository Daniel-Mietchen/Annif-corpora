Discovering the Bible in the non-biblical world
At a time when communal frenzy is running amok and war-clouds are perilously gathering, religiously committed persons need to interrogate anew what their religious traditions could offer in terms of effective harmony and peace. This Book is an attempt to bring into interplay the Christian ideals and practice with the struggles India, and Asia at large, is going through to create a more humane and just society. The book presents refreshingly new and insightful perspectives for a theology that will accompany and support an open engagement with our society, culture and religious traditions at this critical moment. It exhibits an extraordinary breadth of vision and a grand sweep of scholarship. Contextually based on the banks of Ganges, the book grapples with some of the major issues in contemporary theology. A thoroughly critical and creative approach informs the entire work.
