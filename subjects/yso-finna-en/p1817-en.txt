This work analyzes the processes of nation-building in nineteenth and early-twentieth-century Southeastern Europe. A product of transnational comparative teamwork, this collection represents a coordinated interpretation based on ten varied academic cultures and traditions. The originality of the approach lies in a combination of three factors: seeing nation-building as a process that is to a large extent driven by intellectuals and writers, rather than just a side effect of infrastructural modernization processes; looking at the regional, cross-border ramifications of these processes (rather than in a rigid single-country-by-country perspective); and, looking at the autonomous role of intellectuals in these areas, rather than just seeing Southeastern Europe as an appendix to Europe-at-large, passively undergoing European influences.The essays explore the political instrumentalization of the concepts of folk, people and ethnos in Southeastern Europe in the 'long 19th century' by mapping the discursive and institutional itineraries through which this set of notions became a focal point of cultural and political thought in various national contexts; a process that coincided with the emergence of political modernity.

This title adds a new dimension to the citizenship literature by using citizenship as a lens through which to explore the relation between personal lives and social policy. Citizenship is both one of the most taken-for-granted and most contested ideas in British social policy. While some claim that it defines the parameters of rights and responsibilities in advanced liberal democracies, others consider it to be among the most exclusionary of discourses and practices. Spurred by the effects of globalization, the rise in the movement of people around the world, and the profound reconstruction of welfare forms and relations, the issue of citizenship has come to occupy a central place in both official and popular debates. Taking these debates as the starting-point, this book focuses on the following domains to consider some of the dimensions of the lived practices and experiences of citizenship: the 'high moment' of working-class citizenship that was embodied in the post-war welfare state; the conflicts and anxieties experienced by children and parents in the transition to secondary school; the struggle of refugees and asylum seekers to gain right of residence in the UK and the possibility of building a new life. The authors draw upon a range of theoretical perspectives, including feminist, psychoanalytic and Marxist, to explore what citizenship can tell us about the ways in which personal lives not only are shaped by social policy, but can become the site from which some of the exclusions embedded in social policy and welfare practice are contested.

"This volume is devoted to the relationship between political and social dimensions of nation-building in Estonia. The authors of the volume analyse the Estonian nation-building since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and Estonia regained independence, in the context of post-communist transformation and globalization. Such a double macro-historical change has brought about highly polarized views in society between the ethnic Estonian and Russian-speaking communities on a number of key aspects of nation-building, like ethnic policy, meaning of national integration, etc. The volume argues that national integration can progress only via formation of a unifying citizen identity in Estonia, embedded within democratic political processes"--Publisher's description, back cover.
