What makes segmentation good? A case study in boreal forest habitat mapping
Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has emerged as one of the most promising remote sensing technologies to provide data for research and operational applications in a wide range of disciplines related to management of forest ecosystems. This book provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the research and application of ALS in a broad range of forest-related disciplines. However, this book is more than just a collection of individual contributions – it consists of a well-composed blend of chapters dealing with fundamental methodological issues and contributions reviewing and illustrating the use of ALS within various domains of application. The main aim of this book is to provide the scientific and technical background of ALS with a particular focus on applicability in operational forestry. Most of the chapters are devoted to applications in forest inventory and forest ecology such as forest management inventory and assessments of canopy cover, habitats and organism-habitat relationships. Many of the chapters focus on boreal forests simply because methods were initially developed for boreal conditions. However, examples show the most common applications of ALS at various geographical scales; from individual trees, to forest stands, regions and nations. The reviews provide a comprehensive and unique overview of recent research and applications that researchers, students and practitioners of forest remote sensing and forest ecosystem assessment should consider as a useful reference text.

Forest structure indicators based on tree size inequality and their relationships to airborne laser scanning
The aim of this study was to examine how well stem volume, above-ground biomass and dominant height can be predicted using nationwide airborne laser scanning (ALS) based regression models. The study material consisted of nine practical ALS inventory projects taken from different parts of Finland. We used field sample plots and airborne laser scanning data to create nationwide and regional models for each response variable. The final models had one or two ALS predictors, which were chosen based on the root mean square error (RMSE), and cross-validated. Finally, we tested how much predictions would improve if the nationwide models were calibrated with a small number of regional sample plots. Although forest structures differ among different parts of Finland, the nationwide volume and biomass models performed quite well (leave-inventory-area-out RMSE 22.3% to 33.8%, mean difference [MD] -13.8% to 18.7%) compared with regional models (leave-plot-out RMSE 20.2% to 26.8%). However, the nationwide dominant height model (RMSE 5.4% to 7.7%, MD -2.0% to 2.8%, with the exception of the Tornio region - RMSE 11.4%, MD -9.1%) performed nearly as well as the regional models (RMSE 5.2% to 6.7%). The results show that the nationwide volume and biomass models provided different means than real means at regional level, because forest structure and ALS device have a considerable effect on the predictions. Large MDs appeared especially in northern Finland. Local calibration decreased the MD and RMSE of volume and biomass models. However, the nationwide dominant height model did not benefit much from calibration..
