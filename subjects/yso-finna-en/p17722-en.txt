Abstract. - Yhteenveto.
The purpose of this thesis is to examine a corporate web site's role in strengthening the company's image as a potential employer. The goal is to find out how university students perceive the client company's web site and how this web site could be developed to help it correspond better to students' career aspirations. The client company's success in the market is closely linked to their human capital, which highlights the importance of attracting talented university graduates. The framework of the thesis consists of the different elements that affect an employer's image. It examines how the general corporate image affects a specific employer's image. After this, it looks at how recruitment communication and a corporate web site can be used to increase an organization's attractiveness to potential employees. As part of my thesis I conducted a Webropol survey for the third-year students of Aalto University School of Economics. The survey was conducted in May 2012. The first part of the survey examined the same factors than the employer image surveys conducted in 2011 and 2010 by Universum. However, the main focus in this case was on the client company's web site and how it reflects the desired employer image. The survey reveals that these students value the same things that they traditionally have valued, i.e. possibilities for training and development and a pleasant work environment. These students also consider a corporate web site as their preferred source of information, as was previously the case. However, the aspects that students consider the most important are not visible enough on the client company's web site. The company should focus on simplifying their employment content information and navigation so that students could find the relevant information more easily. One developmental suggestion was also to increase the transparency between the company and students.
