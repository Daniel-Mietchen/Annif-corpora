The term immersion continues to be applied inconsistently within and across different fields of research connected with the study of virtual reality and interactive media. Moreover, immersion is oftentimes used interchangeably with the terms presence and engagement. This article details a review of existing definitions of immersion originating within the study of video games, virtual environments, and literary works of fiction. Based on this review, a three-dimensional taxonomy of the various conceptualizations of immersion is proposed. That is, the existing definitions of immersion may be broadly divided into three categories, each representing a dimension of the taxonomy: immersion as a property of a system, a subjective response to narrative contents, or a subjective response to challenges within the virtual environment. Finally, four distinct theories of presence are introduced and, based on the established taxonomy, we discuss how the individual theories relate to existing definitions of immersion.

The storytellers are old and young and their lives reflect the diversity and commonality of deaf experience. The pain acknowledged by a generation brought up forbidden to sign contrasts with the confidence of young people using New Zealand Sign Language as they assert 'Deaf pride'. Children growing up in deaf families talk of their identity quite differently from those in hearing families. There is joy and sadness, confusion and resolution, regret and optimism. Several generations of deaf voices speak here of their experience in the wider context of New Zealand life: they echo the research and new political consciousness that identifies the deaf as a cultural-linguistic community. And their words hold a mirror to mainstream society's ill-informed perceptions of being deaf. Central of this book is a statement about the value of communication - within and beyond the deaf community.

If social, political, and material transformation is to have a lasting impact on individuals and society, it must be integrated within ordinary experience. "Refiguring the Ordinary" examines the ways in which individuals' bodies, habits, environments, and abilities function as horizons that underpin their understandings of the ordinary. These features of experience, according to Gail Weiss, are never neutral, but are always affected by gender, race, social class, ethnicity, nationality, and perceptions of bodily normality. While no two people will experience the ordinary in exactly the same way, the multiplicities, possibilities, overlaps, and limitations of day-to-day horizons are always intersubjectively constituted. Weiss turns her attention to changing the conditions and experiences of oppression from ordinary to extraordinary. This book is an impressive phenomenological, feminist reading of the complexities of human experience.

This volume offers key insights into the crisis of legitimization that music as a subject of arts education seems to be in. Music as an educational subject is under intense pressure, both economically, due to the reduction of education budgets, as well as due to a loss of status with policy makers. The contributions in this book illuminate Martin Heideggers thinking as a highly cogent theoretical framework for understanding the nature and depth of this crisis. The contributors explore from various angles the relationship between the pressure on music education and the foundations of our technical and rationalized modern society, and lead the way on the indispensable first steps towards reconnecting the cultural practices of education with music and its valuable contributions to personal development.

In this book, a team of international contributors examine bodies, leakage and boundaries, illuminating the contradictions and dilemmas in women's healthcare. Using the concept of pollution, this book highlights how women and health issues are categorised, and health workers and women are confined to roles and places defined as socially appropriate. The book explores in-depth current and historical practices, such as: childbirth and midwifery practice; policies and social practices around breastfeeding; gynaecological nursing, female incontinence and sexually transmitted infections; miscarriages and termination of pregnancy. Addressing things out of place, from the idea of 'dirty work' to feeling 'dirty', from diagnoses that disrupt our self-image to beliefs and practices which undermine health service provision, this book uses the contradictions in our thinking around pollution and power to stimulate thinking around women's health.

Abstract: This bachelor's thesis was conducted as a case study for restaurant Comico of Naururavintolat Oy. The aim of the study was to measure how customers perceive  experiences during their restaurant visit in the case company and to determine  whether the case company can be identified as an experience service provider. Other objectives were to identify certain details, such as ways to improve the  perception of experiences. The theoretical part of thesis was gathered from marketing and business literature, articles and previous publications all related to the topics at hand. The theory examines experience industry as a whole, with emphasis on customer's perception over different components related to a restaurant service. Customers are at central  focus in this study, which means that individual factors such as emotions, preferences and expectations are carefully investigated. A qualitative method was chosen for the empirical part of the study. An openended questionnaire was designed to interview customers. Interviews were recorded. Subsequently, restaurant's manager was interviewed with the same  technique. The interviews were summarized and analysed by using content  analysis. The results of the interviews are spread throughout the text along with  the theory. The results provide a direction to develop Comico's ability to act in the future. The case company's overall service process is good, yet some details should be improved regarding service attitude of the employees, consistency of the theme  and decorative details. The case company is also recommended to conduct a quantitative research to measure customer satisfaction. The most important  outcome of this thesis was to provide a framework for any restaurant business  willing to succeed in the field of experience industry. This thesis not only helps  service companies to identify failure points within their service processes but also  gives suggestions and examples how to improve them..
