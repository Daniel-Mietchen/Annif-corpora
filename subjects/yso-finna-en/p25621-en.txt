This book places equal emphasis on both ends of the transnational adoption chain: the formation of the adoptive family and the disaggregation of the family of origin. Situating these in the context of the Global North-South divide, it investigates the devastating effects of social inequalities on the adoption process and on the mothers whose children are adopted. The focus is on adoptions from Africa, which given the declining numbers of potential adoptees globally has recently emerged as a new continent of origin. Based on unique primary material gathered in in-depth interviews with South African families of origin and Finnish adoptive families, the book investigates the decision-making processes of both sets of parents and the encounters between them. The first mothers’ narratives are juxtaposed with those of the adopters and of the adoption social workers who act on the principles of the wider adoption system. Concluding with a critique of the Global Northism that exemp  lifies current practices, the author sketches the contours of a more just approach to transnational adoption that would shatter rather than perpetuate inequality. The book could also be read as an exposé of the consequences of current inequalities for poor families.
