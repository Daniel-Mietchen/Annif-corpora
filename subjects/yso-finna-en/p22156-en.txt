humanistic geography
People and the arctic : a prospectus for research on the human dimensions of the arctic system (HARC), for the National Science Foundation Arctic System Science Program
The purpose of the book is to tie together various perspectives, insights and constructions pertaining to contemporary landscapes and landscape representations from different theoretical and methodological positions as well as from diverse geographical and historical contexts in order to elucidate and illustrate processes of cultural transformation inscribed in space. The unifying theme, as well as the main goal and prospective contribution then, lies in the exploration of these developing forces and characteristics of the new cultural economy of space in the contemporary landscape(s).The primary objective of bringing together geographical perspectives from various subdisciplinary fields is to examine and discuss ways in which the complexities of this newly-emerging cultural economy of space are applied on various sorts of landscapes, i.e. urban and rural landscapes, landscapes of everyday life, landscapes of tourism and recreation, postcolonial and hybrid landscapes, landscapes of economic production, landscapes of the street and of public life, "national landscapes" and so on. The overarching question, thus, is: how do these processes work in different geographical contexts and contribute to place and landscape creation?

Geography and Geographers provides a survey of the major debates, key thinkers and schools of thought in human geography in the English-speaking world, setting them within the context of economic, social, cultural and political as well as intellectual changes. It focuses on the debates among geographers regarding what their discipline should study and how that should be done, and draws on a wide reading of the geographical literature produced during a fifty-year period characterised by both growth in the number of academic geographers and substantial shifts in conceptions of the discipline's scientific rationale.
