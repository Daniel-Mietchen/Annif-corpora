Nonprofit organizations, which collectively make up the emerging sector, have an increasingly influential role in the economies and societies of countries throughout the world. This book, the product of comprehensive international research into the sector, offers an international overview of its scope, structure, financing and role. The authors provide a comparative summary of the findings of individual empirical analyses into the nonprofit sectors in 12 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Japan, Brazil, Ghana, Egypt, Thailand and India. They explore the global scale of the sector, its sources of revenue, and differences between the countries analyzed. They assess how well-equipped nonprofit organizations are to respond to the shift towards voluntarism and away from government in many societies, and they identify the key issues such organizations need to address in the future, such as coming to terms with globalization.
