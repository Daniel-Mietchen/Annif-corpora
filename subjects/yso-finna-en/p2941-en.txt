This practical, one-of-a-kind field manual explains how equipment in industrial facilities operates and covers all aspects of commissioning relevant to engineers and project managers. This text contains a data log of all major industrial and power plant components, describes how they function, and includes rules of thumb for operation. Hundreds of handy reference materials, such as calculations and tables, plus a comprehensive listing of electrical parts with common supplier nomenclature are also included in this time-saving resource.

"Basic Pneumatics was developed as an introductory text for people who are studying to be maintenance personnel working on production machinery, and for upgrading the knowledge of other factory workers, including machine operators, line mechanics, and newly hired engineers. The book was designed to provide an alternative to the large number of books and manuals on the topic of pneumatics that have a heavy math and theoretical orientation. Basic Pneumatics is designed give a student a firm, hands-on foundation in the fundamentals of pneumatics. It presents a student with the basic competencies required to maintain and troubleshoot most of the pneumatic systems that he or she will encounter on the plant floor"--Back cover.
