Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen with an age-standardized seroprevalence of 52% in Finland. The most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection is labial herpes, but recently HSV-1 has emerged as the most common cause of primary genital herpes in Finnish women. HSV-1 can also lead to severe conditions such as encephalitis.After the primary lytic HSV-1 infection at the epithelia, the progeny viruses infect the innervating sensory neurons. The neuronal infection may lead to a quiescent infection form, called latency. Periodically, the virus may reactivate, which can lead to recurrent infection at the epithelia. During different phases of the viral life cycle the host cells try to restrict the infection. This study set out to investigate the roles of two HSV-1 proteins, γ134.5 and Us3 during different phases of the HSV-1 life cycle.The aim of the first study was to investigate how the deletion of Us3 affected host responses, especially Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling, in monocytic U937 cells. TLR3 expression was increased during Us3 deletion virus infections. This also led to increased activation of IRF-3 and increased expression of type I interferons (IFN) and an interferon stimulated protein. This study shows that TLR3 is involved in controlling the HSV-1 infection and that Us3 regulates IRF-3 activation.The second study focused on the role of the γ134.5 protein in HSV-1 latency. Embryonic mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures were used as a cell culture model for HSV-1 latency and reactivation. In this model γ134.5 deletion viruses did not reactivate as efficiently as wild-type viruses, even though they replicated well and established latency in the neurons.Stress granules are part of the host response. In the third study, the roles of the innate immunity effectors HSV-1 Us3 and human Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in stress granule format ion (SG) were studied. Wild-type HSV-1 efficiently prevented the formation of SGs. The overexpression of ZBP1 resulted in accumulation of smaller but more abundant SGs during oxidative stress. Overexpression of Us3 did not significantly affect the size or number of SGs, but during Us3 deletion virus infection, SG proteins localized to cis-Golgi.This work shows that HSV-1 uses Us3 to evade and modulate host responses and that the γ134.5 protein is required for reactivation in mouse DRG cultures.
