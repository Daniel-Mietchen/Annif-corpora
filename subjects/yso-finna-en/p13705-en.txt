Abstract: Visually recognisable lettering – Burned Serif typeface for the restaurant Soma. The subject of this Thesis is a creation of unique typefaces. The basics of letter formation and readability are covered in theory and how to follow those basics to get the best result. As a method, comparing the versions of the two most common typefaces provided a good background for the Thesis.  The customer's assignment was used as an example, which was to design a company profile to a restaurant/wine bar. The assignment was to design basic elements, such as the logo, web pages and a gift card plus something that the company would be recognized by. For this purpose it was required to create a unique, individual typeface for the company. A specific analysis accounts for the designed typeface with the goal of readability and maintaining a coherent line.  The requirement of readability is the same be it designing a typeface for print or web use. To this day basically grotesque typefaces have been used for the web, but the Author suggests that because of the always developing resolution of screens and pads, more antique typefaces will become more and more commonly used in the web world.
