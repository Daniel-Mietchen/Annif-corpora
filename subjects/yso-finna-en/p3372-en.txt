The main goal of this engineering thesis was to examine Tupla chocolate bar's route from manufacturer to consumer. The length of this transportation is interesting since the Tupla bar is food and therefore, will eventually expire. In February of 2003 there was carried out a withdrawal because of a misstaste found in Tupla. The Best Before  dates on the returned products reveal how old products there are for sale. A survey was also arranged to find out how the withdrawal was experienced both at Leaf Oy and at the cooperating companies this project concerned. The results of the survey were analyzed.
