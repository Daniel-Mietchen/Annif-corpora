The prime objective for writing this thesis was to introduce the concept of modern logistics and to survey both the elements of modern logistics management and specific example that can be helpful in fully understanding such a management in practical application. The well-known management guru Peter Drucker once described logistics as the last profit frontier. As a result, in business, either manufacturing or merchandising, should be of comprehension to the essentials of logistics management to build and manage an efficient logistics system. Retailer giant Wal-Mart, as one of the world's top 500 enterprises, has been holding a position of prestige in the global procurement market. Moreover, Wal-Mart attributes its success to the application of logistics modernization. Clearly, Wal-Mart has been aware that managing the entire modern logistics procedure â€“ from procurement, transportation, distribution, to supply chain and customer service is crucial to maximize profits and minimize costs.

This study is about change management in public health care and its logistic services. It concentrates on human behaviour, actions and feelings in the change process and presents how the cooperation was implemented in the hospital and health care centre point of view. The focus of the study is in communication and how health care centres and hospitals prejudices met the actual implementation.  This study uses two kinds of methods in data collection; Qualitative data collection and the Action Research method. These methods were chosen because the data collection is analysing human behaviour, actions, and feelings rather than analyzing numerical data. The analyze requires deeper interpretation of answers and there must be space for changes during the data collection as well.  The results showed that there were a lot of unclarity and uncertainty with the issues that the change might bring along. The biggest issues turned out to be economic efficiency, realiability of deliveries and communication. The respondents expected to have mutual information flows, cost follow-ups and functional operations. The participants felt that these expectations were not met in the level they seeked and expected to.  The unclarity and uncertainty of the change caused negative attitude which then caused unpreparedness in the change. The unpreparedness led to weaker performance of work which added more pressure on health care centres and hospitals. The pressure was then on the Logistic Centre employees. The pressure affected on personal relationships negatively and weakenend the team work between health care centres, hospitals and the Logistic Centre and this caused tense atmosphere. All the negativity might have caused more fears about the change; are employees in health care centres and hospitals able to meet the required quality of their work.
