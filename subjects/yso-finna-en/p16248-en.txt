The monograph considers the ways in which the Ottoman state in the early modern period mobilized human and material resources for war-making and what secondary effects this had on provincial society. Focusing on the Levantine trading center of Aleppo, it explores changes in the relations of power operating within certain urban institutions - residential quarters, military garrisons and guilds - during the military and fiscal transformations of the late seventeenth century. Using both documents of the central state treasury and the records of local law courts, it examines how the routinization of direct imperial taxes and the assimilation of soldiers to civilian life subverted the city's social and political order.
