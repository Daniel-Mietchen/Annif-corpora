Overview: People have been reading on computer screens for several decades now, predating popularization of personal computers and widespread use of the internet. But it was the rise of eReaders and tablets that caused digital reading to explode. In 2007, Amazon introduced its first Kindle. Three years later, Apple debuted the iPad. Meanwhile, as mobile phone technology improved and smartphones proliferated, the phone became another vital reading platform. In Words Onscreen, Naomi Baron, an expert on language and technology, explores how technology is reshaping our understanding of what it means to read. Digital reading is increasingly popular. Reading onscreen has many virtues, including convenience, potential cost-savings, and the opportunity to bring free access to books and other written materials to people around the world. Yet, Baron argues, the virtues of eReading are matched with drawbacks. Users are easily distracted by other temptations on their devices, multitasking is rampant, and screens coax us to skim rather than read in-depth. What is more, if the way we read is changing, so is the way we write. In response to changing reading habits, many authors and publishers are producing shorter works and ones that don't require reflection or close reading. In her tour through the new world of eReading, Baron weights the value of reading physical print versus online text, including the question of what long-standing benefits of reading might be lost if we go overwhelmingly digital. She also probes how the internet is shifting reading from being a solitary experience to a social one, and the reasons why eReading has taken off in some countries, especially the United States and United Kingdom, but not others, like France and Japan. Reaching past the hype on both sides of the discussion, Baron draws upon her own cross-cultural studies to offer a clear-eyed and balanced analysis of the ways technology is affecting the ways we read today-and what the future might bring.

Interdisciplinarity has become a buzzword in academia, as research universities funnel their financial resources toward collaborations between faculty in different disciplines. In theory, interdisciplinary collaboration breaks down artificial divisions between different departments, allowing more innovative and sophisticated research to flourish. But does it actually work this way in practice? Investigating Interdisciplinary Collaboration puts the common beliefs about such research to the test, using empirical data gathered by scholars from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The book's contributors critically interrogate the assumptions underlying the fervor for interdisciplinarity. Their attentive scholarship reveals how, for all its potential benefits, interdisciplinary collaboration is neither immune to academia's status hierarchies, nor a simple antidote to the alleged shortcomings of disciplinary study.

"The Leonardo Effect ties together the whole primary curriculum by demonstrating the ways in which art and science can be integrated, allowing children to build up both skills and knowledge. It also equips teachers to teach in a more creative and inspiring manner improving children's engagement and attainment. The method aims to excite children's curiosity and to capture their imaginations, igniting a passion for self-motivated learning. Divided into two parts, the first section consists of overview chapters written by lecturers in Education who describe The Leonardo Effect's unique method of integrating art and science in detail, and the outcomes achievable. Part two comprises a series of illustrated case studies contributed by teachers and head teachers who have embedded The Leonardo Effect in their schools, found it has transformed their curriculum, and has been positively evaluated by inspectors. These case studies deal with: - literacy; - creativity; - disaffected learners; - learners with special needs; - school leadership; and - assessment. This book is based on the experiences of researchers, teachers and school leaders who tested The Leonardo Effect in primary schools throughout the British Isles. It has been shown to transform children's learning and raise attainment. Feedback from the schools demonstrates how it enhances teaching and learning. The Leonardo Effect is ideal for students and practising teachers, curriculum developers and academics working in the field of education"--

The person-oriented approach to burnout : A systematic review
Charles S. Peirce (1839-1914) is known as a logician, philosopher, mathematician and physicist. He is one of the most important thinkers in the modern history of science. In the late and most important phase of his work (1891-1909), he wrote thematic essays and lectures selected explicitly as a series for the periodical The Monist. His contributions, of which only excerpts and heavily revised versions have been published thus far, are given in full publication in the Monist texts in this volume intended as a contemporary approach to the highly heterogeneous work of Peirce. It is an attempt to divulge Peirce's thoughts to the international scientific public without editorial modifications. The central objective of the Monist series is the creation of a semiotic methodology. The papers present statements on universal laws, logic, emotions, cognition, desire, experience and knowledge. Besides its relevance in the philosophical and cultural image of research in cognitive science and logic, it is shown by the topics discussed by Peirce that these essays have high relevance for the contemporary natural sciences.

"Through a series of exquisite encounters with children, and through a lucid opening up of new aspects of poststructuralist theorizing, Bronwyn Davies opens up new ways of thinking about, and intra-acting with, children. This book carefully guides the reader through a wave of thought that turns the known into the unknown, and then slowly, carefully, makes new forms of thought comprehensible, opening, through all the senses, a deep understanding of our embeddedness in encounters with each other and with the material world. This book takes us into Reggio-Emilia-inspired Swedish preschools in Sweden, into the author's own community in Australia, into poignant memories of childhood, and offers the reader insights into:new ways of thinking about children and their communities; the act of listening as emergent and alive; ourselves as mobile and multiple subjects; the importance of remaining open to the not-yet-known.Defining research as diffractive, and as experimental, Davies' relationship to the teachers and pedagogues she worked with is one of co-experimentation. Her relationship with the children is one in which she explores the ways in which her own new thinking and being might emerge, even as old ways of thinking and being assert themselves and interfere with the unfolding of the new. She draws us into her ongoing experimentation, asking that we think hard, all the while delighting our senses with the poetry of her writing, and the stories of her encounters with children. "--

"Current teaching, learning and assessment practices can lead students to believe that courses within a programme are self-sufficient and separate. Integrative Learning explores this issue, and considers how intentional learning helps students become integrative thinkers who can see connections in seemingly disparate information, and draw on a wide range of knowledge to make decisions. Written by international contributors who engaged reflectively with their teaching and their students' learning, the book seeks to develop a shared language of integrative learning, encouraging students to adapt skills learned in one situation to problems encountered in another, and make autonomous connections across courses, between experiences, and throughout their lives. More informed teachers can help students develop the necessary attributes for intentional learning, which include having a sense of purpose, fitting fragmentary information into a 'learning framework', understanding something of their own learning processes, asking probing questions, reflecting on their own choices, and knowing when to ask for help. Integrative Learning draws on international research and vast studies to provide the reader with the resources to ensure access to a unified learning experience. The book discusses conceptual and technical tools necessary for facilitating integrative learning across a range of disciplines as well as providing learning pedagogies and considers integrative learning in the context of the relevance of higher education in the complexity and uncertainty of the 21st century. It will appeal to academics and researchers in the field of higher education, as well as those generating higher education curriculums"--

Documents research on the impact of computer games on the learning of adults. Computer games and learning are characterized from a series of different theoretical and empirical viewpoints. Both civilian sector and military applications are presented. While effectiveness of game environments to support learning can be documented in terms of intensity and longevity of engagement (participants voting with their time), as well as the commercial success of the games, there is much less solid empirical information about what instructional outcomes are systematically achieved by the playing of individual and multiplayer games. This book will address these issues.Designed for professionals in the gaming, simulation, assessment and evaluation, educational technology, and educational psychology communities, this book explores the state of the art in the use of computer game technology for teaching and measurement of learning in adults. Its unique focus is on the empirical impact, both qualitative and quantitative, of computer games on the learning of adults.

Presented with the task of preparing students for life in a rapidly shrinking world, even scholars teaching in cross-disciplinary areas like women's studies may find themselves overwhelmed by the need to cross disciplinary and geographic borders-often in defiance of academic traditions and prejudices. And some faculty are leading the way to a curriculum that reflects the forces of globalization. Encompassing Gender is an anthology of more than 40 essays by 60 scholars, many of them working in groups that cut across the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences, all of them committed to an interdisciplinary approach to internationalizing the curriculum. These scholar-teachers promote the discovery of more diverse and global perspectives. Strategies for focus are key. The volume includes essays, course syllabi, annotated bibliographies and videographies, as well as novel teaching strategies and suggestions for a variety of international materials. The contributors take a fully integrated approach to such transformational curricular work, recommending both theoretical perspectives and specific strategies for teaching.
