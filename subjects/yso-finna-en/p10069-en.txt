"The Watercolors of Winslow Homer examines the artist's spectacular achievement in the medium, beginning in 1873 with his earliest watercolors depicting the carefree life of children playing at the shore, and concluding with the sparkling images he painted in the first years of the twentieth century that capture the tropical lushness of Florida, Bermuda, and the Bahamas. Along the way, Homer's watercolors embraced the variety of American life, from the New England coast to the rustic farms of upstate New York and Virginia. Homer's brush pictured both the genteel world of fashionable young ladies and the Adirondacks forests where rugged lumbermen and hunters plied their trade. Homer's travels also took him to the English coast where he painted somber, monumental watercolors of the storm-swept sea, and late in life to the Caribbean where the warm sun inspired some of his most colorful and sensuous works. Above all, Homer was a confirmed outdoorsman, and the watercolors he painted in the forests and lakes of the Adirondacks and Quebec are among the most profound evocations of natural beauty ever created."

"The Landscape Painting of China: Musings of a Journeyman offers a stunning demonstration of the power of visual-based methodologies in the examination of great art. In it, Chinese landscape painting is explored from the emergence of monumental landscape painting in the ninth century through the artistic transformations of the early seventeenth century. The leading masters--everyone from Jing Hao to Dong Qichang and Chen Hongshou--and the major monuments are subjected to a searching analysis, grounded in detailed observation and a mastery of both the traditional Chinese written source material and contemporary Western, Japanese, and Chinese scholarship."--Publisher's website.
