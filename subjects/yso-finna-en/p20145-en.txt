"In this information age, career and technical education (CTE) has become a multibillion dollar training enterprise. To make our students more competitive in the labor force and to make our nation economically strong and firms internationally competitive, we have to depend on CTE to train today's workers of various kinds. Definitive Readings in the History, Philosophy, Theories and Practice of Career and Technical Education brings together definitive writings on CTE by leading figures and by contemporary thinkers in the history, philosophy, practice and theories of the field. Filling a much needed void in existing literature, this book equips scholars and practitioners with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to succeed in the field of CTE." Provided by publisher.
