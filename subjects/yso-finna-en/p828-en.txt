The latest financial crisis has given rise to sweeping transformations in labor markets. Today, many developed countries require a variety of skilled workers in order to develop a knowledge economy. Since these countries face certain internal demographic and educational problems that are obstacles to sustained economic growth, they require skilled migrant workers. Our study analyzes these situations in two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden. We found that both countries are using an active strategy through policies aimed to attract and retain the most talented foreign students and workers, easing their entrance into labor markets and granting them permanent residence..

"Governing Cross-Border Higher Education examines the role of governments in relation to three key aspects of international education: student mobility; migration of international students; and transnational provision through collaboration or branch campuses. The research for this book is informed by interviews with key stakeholders in ten countries and extensive engagement with policy makers and international agencies. It analyses the ways in which governments are able to direct or at least influence these cross-border movements in higher education. The book explores key issues that national governments are invariably required to contend with in an increasingly globalised higher education market, as well as the policy options available to them in such a climate. Alongside this, there is analysis into why states adopt particular approaches, with critical assessment of their varying success. Key topics include: the political economy of international higher education;recruiting students;promoting and regulating transnational provision; student migration;governing educational imports; managing the outflow of students; the regulated market.This book will be a valuable and insightful resource for those involved in higher education policy and interested in the globalisation of the higher education market"--

"In today's modern climate, education and learning take place in multiple and diverse spaces. Increasingly, these spaces are both physical and virtual in nature. Access to and use of information and communication technologies, and the emergence of knowledge-based economies necessitate an understanding of the plurality of spaces (such as homes, workplaces, international space and cyberspace) in which learning can take place. The spaces of policy making with respect to education are also being transformed, away from traditional centres of policy formation towards the incorporation of a wider range of actors and sites. These changes coincide with a more general interest in space and spatial theory across the social sciences, where notions of simultaneity and diversity replace more modernist conceptions of linear progress and development through time. This volume proffers a unique perspective on the transformation of education in the 21st century, by bringing together leading researchers in education, sociology and geography to address directly questions of space in relation to education and learning. This collection of essays: - examines the changing and diverse spaces and concepts of education (occurring simultaneously at different scales and in different parts of the world) - explores where education and learning take place - discusses how spaces of education vary at different stages (compulsory schooling, tertiary and higher education, adult education and workplace learning) - inspects the ways in which the meanings attached to education and learning change in different national and regional contexts"-- Provided by publisher.
