In the past 30 years, the study of intimate partner violence (IPV) has advanced considerably. Previously, IPV was conceptualized narrowly as male physical violence against women due to a need for dominance. Now, experts realize that a variety of factors are associated with IPV and that IPV takes many forms - from verbal abuse or slapping to highly violent physical abuse or rape. In addition, research shows that women are often the perpetrators of IPV. As a result, IPV interventions have shifted over time from gender-focused interventions to gender-neutral interventions, with an emphasis on empirical evidence. Preventing Partner Violence presents a comprehensive overview of the most up-to-date research on IPV. Leading experts in the field cover a large range of topics, including theory, risk factors, health effects, surveillance, prevention, and intervention.The editors emphasize understanding the development of IPV perpetration by itself and in the context of other risk factors. Above all, they demonstrate the complexity of IPV and the importance of taking an empirical approach to prevention and treatment.

The theoretical part of the thesis is designed to give the reader current information on the issues related to security of personnel in reception work. The empirical part of the thesis is based on a questionnaire given to all receptionists of five S-hotels included in the study: Hotel Helsinki, Hotel Vaakuna, Hotel Klaus Kurki, Hotel Torni and Hotel Pasila.
