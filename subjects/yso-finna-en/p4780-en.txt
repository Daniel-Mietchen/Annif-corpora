This thesis examines the development possibilities of the Degree Programme in Tourism (DPT) in Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK) from the different stakeholders' perspective. The focus development area is the curriculum of the study programme which is under renewal and will be established in 2013. The aim of the thesis is to produce concrete development ideas from the experiences and opinions of the internal and external stakeholders of TAMK. The internal stakeholders are represented by the students of the DPT, and the external stakeholders are the representatives of the local labour market. The possible cooperation between the stakeholders is investigated in order to bring working life closer to the students and studies and to benefit the local businesses. Primary data was collected from the internal stakeholders with group theme interviews and from the external stakeholders with a semi-structured questionnaire, as well as with a semi-structured élite interview. Secondary data included existing data such as scientific literature, statistics, notes, the Internet, researches and other available publications. In the thesis process, the theories of competencies and qualifications were used as well as the Learning by Developing model of Laurea University of Applied Sciences discovered by benchmarking. The collected and analyzed data revealed the target areas of development. According to the internal stakeholders the improvements should be targeted to the working life relation of the studies; to the quality of education and the course contents; to the guidance received; and to the more practical approach in studies. All these would prepare the students better for the future working life. The external stakeholders stressed that the practical know-how and multidisciplinary skills are the requirements of the working life, and that the attention should be paid to the requirements imposed by the tourism industry trends in the Tampere Region in the DPT studies. The results indicate that mutually beneficial changes to the curriculum and cooperation between the stakeholders can be made, in which case the studies would prepare the students with competencies to meet the qualifications of the working life. According to the writers' of the thesis the working life relation in the studies should be emphasized more and it would also be one area for further research. Key words: Curriculum, developing, DPT, stakeholder, Tampere Region.
Article deals with foreign labour migration influence on both qualitative and quantitative human capital parameters. Three global challenges negatively affecting human capital in a recipient-country were found out: low-skilled migrants; contradictions in the present-day migration processes; non-application of competence-based approach towards foreign labour migrants. Authors elaborated a number of recommendations on migration policy for Russian authorities to overcome these disadvantages..

The analysis of the instructor accounts reveals three kinds of closely related problems inherent in the assessment of multimodality. First, there is a problem associated with the use of conventional criteria of texts, such as clarity or coherence, when instructors attempt to apply those to visuals. Secondly, there is a problem associated with the instructors attempt to describe the inter-dynamic relationship between the textual mode and the visual mode. These problems are related by a term, ''linkage,'' which is defined as containing material, technical, and theoretical aspects. Finally, there is a problem in the actual assessment of the projects that seems to be a consequence of the multiplicity of meaning available in the complex compositions. The instructors seem to abandon a criterion motivated assessment in favor of a more holistic procedure that relies upon implicit standards of rhetorical affect or creative or aesthetic qualities. The study concludes with recommendations for improved assessment practice and suggestions for further research.

This study examines the professed and actual practices of assessment of freshman year composition instructors. The aim of the study was to elicit the criteria and standards of assessment that guided the instructor's readings of the documents created by students for a visual rhetoric assignment. A set of interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the semester provided the data for analysis. A traditional grounded method of qualitative analysis was combined with a network textual analysis to understand the individual instructor accounts of their experience evaluating the student works.
