This is a book about the research process that led scientists to the discovery of a group of molecules that act as carriers of information among the cells of our body, which the book refers to collectively as "body messages." Among the thousands of body messages, the author selected those that are part of her own research, the cytokines, adipokines, and other proteins that regulate inflammation and metabolism. She also interviewed twenty researchers who contributed significantly to the field, asking details about their discoveries while also inquiring about their life and education. Along with scientists' personal recollections, the book reconstructs the discovery process based on published reports of the original experimental findings. Though the book's main theme is the process of discovery, it devotes considerable space to the biology of body messages and the consequence of their identification for medical practice.--

"Stem Cell Labeling for Delivery and Tracking Using Noninvasive Imaging provides a comprehensive overview of cell therapy imaging, ranging from the basic biology of cell therapeutic choices to the preclinical and clinical applications of cell therapy. It emphasizes the use of medical imaging for therapeutic delivery/targeting, cell tracking, and determining therapeutic efficacy. The book first presents background information and insight on the major classes of stem and progenitor cells. It then describes the main imaging modalities and state-of-the-art techniques that are currently employed for stem cell tracking. In the final chapters, leading scholars offer clinical perspectives on existing and potential uses of stem cells as well as the impact of image-guided delivery and tracking in major organ systems. Through clear descriptions and color images, this volume illustrates how noninvasive imaging is used to track stem cells as they repair damaged tissue in the body. With contributions from some of the most prominent preclinical and clinical researchers in the field, the book helps readers to understand the evolving concepts of stem cell labeling and tracking as the field continues to move forward"--Provided by publisher.

Now available with the most current and relevant research from Cell Press, Clark's Molecular Biology, Academic Cell Update Edition, gives readers both the concepts and the applications students need to know to fully grasp Molecular Biology. Clark introduces basic concepts and then follows with specific applications in research today. This book is further enhanced by its inclusion in the Academic Cell collaboration, providing it with links to current and recently published research. Molecular Biology draws in the applications from a number of fields including human cellular research, human medicine, agriculture research and veterinary medicine.
Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying numerous diseases of the central nervous system is of paramount importance to develop effective therapies and pharmaceutical agents. Cell to cell signal transduction lies within the foundation of healthy physiological function as well as countless disorders. Cellular signaling pathways traditionally initiate at the plasma membrane receptors capable of relaying an extracellular signal to the intracellular environment allowing a rapid response. In the last decade a specific transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor, GPR17, has been associated with such diseases as ischemia, multiple sclerosis and glioblastoma. It was demonstrated to have a degenerative effect on neuronal cells and a stimulating effect on white blood cells and myelin-producing cells of the brain. Yet, remarkably little is known about the precise pathway of its signaling. In this study attempts were made to unravel whether GPR17 receptor causes changes to normal function of essential cellular organelle, mitochondrion.   The effect of GPR17 on mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring the changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels generated and tightly regulated within mitochondria. The ROS levels were analyzed by staining GPR17-transfected cells with a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye. The fluorescence intensity was measured with a high-throughput microplate reader based technique.   This work established a connection between GPR17 receptor and mitochondrial ROS. The results demonstrate that activation of GPR17 with its effective agonist at normal and oxidative stress conditions leads to elevated ROS levels that contribute to cellular damage. It was shown that inhibition of GPR17 with its antagonist prevents generation of high ROS levels and its detrimental effects. It was concluded that targeting GPR17 with clinical antagonist drugs can alleviate ischemic injury to mitochondria. Furthermore, it was observed that GPR17 signalling pathway engages complex I of mitochondrial electron transport chain for signal transduction. Our work provides novel insights into GPR17 signalling pathway. Further research is required to validate our findings and discover yet unknown links in the biochemical chain of GPR17 signalling pathway. Keywords: GPR17, GPCR, mitochondria, signalling pathway, ischemia.
