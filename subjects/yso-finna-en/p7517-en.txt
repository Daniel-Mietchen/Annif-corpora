China was able to combine slow inflation with very rapid economic growth for more than a decade. Finally, in 2007 inflation started to accelerate and there are a number of factors that may increase the pressure on China's price level in the near future. Most importantly, money supply growth is expected to remain rapid due to the ballooning foreign currency inflows. In addition, according to some estimates, economic growth has accelereated above its long-term potential and also a number of structural factors are likely to push production costs up. Counterbalancing part of the rising costs, productivity growth has somewhat accelerated during recent years. With low cost levels and fastly growing exports, China is believed to have exported deflation into its trading partners in recent years. However, due to the fact that the direct impacts of globalisation on inflation in the advanced economies have been moderate, also the effect of a possible rise in China's cost leve!  l on inflation in eg euro area is expected to remain small. However, the indirect impacts on price dynamics are much more difficult to forecast.  Keywords: China, inflation, monetary policy .

Today's intense competition forces companies to improve their operations and track costs more accurately than before. Fast industrialism in China and continually increasing expenses in companies have made them to face the fact that the time of easy profits and cheap prices are long gone. Global sourcing and purchasing has opened multiple new opportunities for different companies but total cost calculations for these acquisitions can be complex and time consuming. But even rough averages from these calculations can help companies to identify the main cost drivers of different acquisitions and add purchasing cost know-how. This thesis was commissioned by Etola Industrial Products (Tianjin) Ltd that is located in Tianjin, China. The objective of the thesis was to determine the cost elements that occur in international and local purchasing, to build a total cost calculation for two different options to buy pressure lubrication unit components and to compare these two total cost calculations. Data used in this study is collected from purchasing literature, company documents, by interviewing Etola China CEO, department managers and suppliers. Time drivers used in total cost calculations were timed in Etola China factory in Tianjin China during normal working hours. In the theoretical part of the thesis global sourcing and purchasing, supplier evaluation and selection, and total cost of ownership are introduced. The theoretical part is based on purchasing literature and internet sources. In the theoretical part the basic information of the purchasing process, supplier evaluation and total cost calculation are introduced to provide the understanding of the cost drivers of purchase. The results from total cost calculations that were conducted in the empirical part of the thesis revealed significant costs in indirect cost drivers that have not been calculated before..The total cost comparison between two options revealed the effect that continually strengthening Chinese Yuan has on European supplier prices. Chinese Yuan has appreciated a lot within last year and some of the European suppliers? prices have already become more affordable than Chinese suppliers' products. The objectives of the thesis were achieved and the results that it provided are valuable for Etola China. With the help of the total cost analysis conducted in the thesis, Etola China can identify costs in international as well as in local acquisitions and to improve its purchasing to be more profitable. By using the TCO tool, Etola China purchasing can achieve cost savings and improve its position on continually leaner Chinese markets.

The development of large-scale agricultural mechanization required to sustain food production, combined with limited conventional fuel resources, spurs on to better assess the time and energy investments required for commodities production. The proposed analysis is based on the description of field working dynamics collected on an experimental tractor during a plowing operation. The energy needs can there be characterized as having a dual alternating profile, depending on the tractor working phase within the field. As a result, two field oriented performance indicators consisting in time efficiency [h.ha-1] and area specific consumption [l.ha-1] are defined out of the profile characteristics. A model converting the draft of an implement into an engine running point is then developed to compute these indicators. The model is fitted on data collected over conventional bench tests, and is validated by an application to a plowing operation. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis on the operational parameters is conducted.

The aim of this paper is to present the method and tool for optimisation of beef-fattening diets. Changes in policy environment and changes in costs of feed pose challenges for farm efficiency. We construct a spreadsheet from two modules based on mathematical deterministic programming techniques. In order to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of costs that may be incurred, the first module utilizes a linear program for least-cost ration formulation. The resulting value is then targeted as a cost goal in the second module. This is supported by weighted goal programming with a penalty function system. The approach presented here is an example of how a combination of mathematical programming techniques might be applied to prepare a user-friendly tool for "optimal" ration formulations. We report results that confirm this approach as useful, since one is able to formulate a least-cost ration without risking a decrease in the ration's nutritive value or affecting the balance between nutrients.
