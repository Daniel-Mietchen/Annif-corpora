The purpose of this Master's thesis was to improve a technology oriented mobile network performance monitoring towards a service oriented model, and study the fundamental mobile network characteristics affecting the mobile network performance reporting. This Master's thesis introduces relations between mobile network architecture, radio network structure and mobile network Performance Management. The Six Sigma methodology is introduced on a general level, and common statistics to monitor a process are presented. The research work for this Master's thesis was carried out inside the Author's Six Sigma Black Belt project to renew the Mobile Network Performance Quality Team Report. The Six Sigma DMAIC process was used to reach the results. The scope of the thesis was limited to speech telephone service and the primary measure for the analysis was the KPI call success.The DMAIC process Measure phase result was a new service oriented report structure which associates the technological KPI sets with the services critical to characteristics. There were two main results from the DMAIC process Analyze phase. The first Analyze phase result was the most critical input factors for the KPI call success. The mobile network's fundamental characteristics found were the populations Rural and Urban and the traffic share between them, which explains the long term variation in the statistically significant sense. The second Analyze phase result was the found root cause for the large short term variation. The formula of the used KPI call success itself was the root cause indicating lower performance for the days with a higher average call duration.The common finding of the long term and short term analysis was that the customer behaviour is a statistically significant factor for mobile network performance monitoring in the scope of traffic movements between the populations and call duration changes. The importance of customer behavioural factors increases if the KPI measures are used to compare the performance of mobile networks from different markets when such customer behaviour difference might occur.

The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the evolution of third generation mobile networks from certification laboratory point of view and to draw conclusions about affects of LTE to laboratory. Certification laboratory performs conformance testing to fulfill requirements set by certification scheme. Requirement consists of defined standards.3GPP is a standardization organization producing GSM/UMTS family standards, therefore this thesis deals with its creation and general structure as well as working group methods of standard creation processes. WCDMA technology development is handled in general and also with comparison to previous GSM technology networks in order to give a more comprehensive view to digital mobile systems. UMTS system architecture and LTE physical layer is highlighted due to the fact that it has a major impact to testing methods and processes. LTE Conformance testing specification is described in section level and conclusions of laboratory impacts are presented. Through this thesis work it became evident that due to the numerous changes in LTE network architecture, transmission schemes, physical channels and protocol stacks new type of test platforms are needed for the conformance testing purposes. Therefore certification laboratory needs to trigger multiple processes related to follow up vendor activities and to ensure staff competence in relations to new standard requirements.
