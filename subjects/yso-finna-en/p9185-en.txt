Analysis of Cosmetic Products advises the reader from an analytical chemistry perspective on the choice of suitable analytical methods for production monitoring and quality control of cosmetic products. In the format of an easy-to-understand compendium of published literature on the subject, this book will enable people working in the cosmetic industry or in research laboratories to: * become familiar with the main legislative and analytical literature on this subject and  * learn about and choose suitable analytical procedures for production monitoring and control of cosmetic p
Water quality : determination of fluoride : international standard. Part 2, Determination of inorganically bound total fluoride after digestion and distillation
This thesis includes the water quality assessment and sanitary inspection of 27 water sources in four districts namely Kavre, Rasuwa, Ramechhap and Chitwan in the Central region of Nepal. All the relevant information was collected and review by Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), Nepal with the help of its support organization. Altogether four different groups were formed, which would visit fields and carry out water quality testing. Altogether 18 physico-chemical parameters were tested and those parameters are pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, appearance, color, dissolved solids, suspended solids, alkalinity, bicarbonate, chloride, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, nitrate, ammonia, iron and manganese. Similarly, bacteriological parameter included the detection of the indicator bacteria, faecal coliform. Besides, Langlier saturation index was calculated for determining scale formation and corrosion potential.  Sanitary inspection was conducted for each water source in order to find out about the possible sources of contamination, if any.  Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed by HANA and ENPHO field kits. Faecal coliform analysis was carried out by membrane filtration method by using Del Agua field kit. Langlier saturation index was determined by calculation method and was based on the parameters like pH, temperature, calcium hardness and alkalinity. For sanitary inspection a standard form was developed and filled, which also included a check list to identify possible pollution sources. Risk levels have been assigned to each water source and there are four risk classes namely no risk, low risk, intermediate risk and high risk. Each source falls in one of the four categories based on the results obtained from physico-chemical analysis; bacteriological analysis, saturation analysis and Sanitary inspection. The results will be discussed in the details which show that there are no risks at all.

Traditional in situ surface water sampling produces accurate information on water chemistry and biology. Such sampling is conducted primarily as part of water quality monitoring programmes. If sufficiently consistent, the once collected water quality data could also provide valuable resources for subsequent use in scientific research and long-term monitoring. We examined the spatial and temporal coherence of the archived data resources stored in the environmental information system of the Finnish Environmental Administration (the Hertta-PIVET register). We used phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and primary productivity data collected during 1971-2006 as sample resources for environmental studies on the highly fragmented SW coast of Finland (Northern Baltic Sea). 733 sampling stations were categorized according to the total number of sampling days, the consistence of sampling, the number of representative years and the continuity of sampling. Considerable spatial and temporal inconsistencies were observed, making the accumulated data resources rather unsuitable for many types of environmental studies. Synchronization of sampling activities could improve the representativeness of spatial and temporal coverage of regional sampling. Strategic planning of sampling is required to achieve more concerted data generation activities and to facilitate long-term spatially representative analyses.

This book provides a contemporary approach to the study of bilingualism. Drawing on contributions from leading experts in the field, this book brings together - in a single volume - a selection of the exciting work conducted as part of the programme of the ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory and Practice at Bangor University, Wales. Each chapter has as its main focus an exploration of the relationship between the two languages of a bilingual. Section by section, the authors draw on current findings and methodologies to explore the ways in which their research can address this question from a number of different perspectives.
