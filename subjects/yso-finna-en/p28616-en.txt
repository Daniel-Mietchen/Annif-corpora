Folklore research at the University of Rostock : the Wossidlo Archive, its development and present situation
"It has become increasingly accepted that important digital data must be retained and shared in order to preserve and promote knowledge, advance research in and across all disciplines of scholarly endeavor, and maximize the return on investment of public funds. To meet this challenge, colleges and universities are adding data services to existing infrastructures by drawing on the expertise of information professionals who are already involved in the acquisition, management and preservation of data in their daily jobs. Data services include planning and implementing good data management practices, thereby increasing researchers' ability to compete for grant funding and ensuring that data collections with continuing value are preserved for reuse. This volume provides a framework to guide information professionals in academic libraries, presses, and data centers through the process of managing research data from the planning stages through the life of a grant project and beyond. It illustrates principles of good practice with use-case examples and illuminates promising data service models through case studies of innovative, successful projects and collaborations"--
Invites teachers and students in gender and women's studies to engage with the library not as an instrument for knowledge, but as a subject and object of knowledge in its own right. The authors and editors had three specific aims. Firstly, to highlight how Gender Studies and the institutions and practices that preserve and disseminate feminist knowledge are historically and systematically intertwined. Secondly, the necessity to reflect on the symbolic meaning and practical institutionalization of libraries and archives as they are undergoing profound transformations under the influence of new (technological) developments; finally, to engage with the question of how these transformations give way to new ways of producing, preserving and disseminating feminist knowledge through practices situated between the force fields of cultural and academic institutions, material and virtual culture, and the collective imaginary.

"Intellectual encounters abound in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century India, comprising surveyors, collectors, antiquarians, philologists and their Indian assistants. The Origins of Modern Historiography in India uncovers everyday practices surrounding acts of collecting, surveying, and antiquarianism in the early period of British colonial rule in India. The new historical method construed by antiquarians, philologists, and their assistants profoundly shaped access and perception of the Indian past. By examining early imperial strategies of producing historical knowledge, this book traces the colonial conditions of the production of "sources," the forging of a new historical method, and the ascendance of positivist historiography in nineteenth-century India"--
