Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (pICH) is a severe, suddenly occurring disease involving high mortality and poor functional outcome. In the absence of curative treatment patient management is mainly supportive with the emphasis on preventing hematoma enlargement and complications. Better understanding of the factors predicting outcome are needed to define effective treatments.An unselected population-based registry study of 982 pICH patients admitted to Oulu University Hospital during the years 1993 to 2008 was conductedThe study revealed that concomitant use of warfarin and serotonin-modulating antidepressants at the time of pICH increases the case fatality rate compared to patients with warfarin alone.An elevated C-reactive protein value on admission was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome after pICH. This association was not explained by pre-existing heart disease, diabetes, severity of the bleeding, or infections.Patients undergoing surgical hematoma evacuation were observed to have improved 3-month survival compared to conservatively treated patients. Improved survival was noticed especially in patients with ≤70 years of age with ≥30ml supratentorial ICHs. Hematoma evacuation did not improve functional outcome.Earlier ischemic stroke was found to be an independent predictor of recurrent pICH. Diabetes seemed to increase and treated hypertension decrease the risk for fatal recurrence. Aspirin or serotonin-modulating antidepressants did not seem to increase the risk of recurrence.

In the present study, some of the difficulties in the treatment of the most common malignant lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), were evaluated. Some patients develop local or central nervous system (CNS) relapse after first-line treatment. The treatment of relapsed disease is challenging and despite all efforts, some patients die of the disease. Chemoresistant disease also remains challenging because some patients suffer from refractory disease of a progressive nature.The antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (Prxs) and thioredoxin-1 (Trx) were evaluated as prognostic and predictive markers of DLBCL. High cytoplasmic expression of Prx VI was found to correlate with poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL. Trx knockdown in lymphoma cell culture revealed a possible predictive role of Trx. Trx knockdown sensitized cells to doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent in treatment schemas of DLBCL. Etoposide, another widely used chemotherapeutic agent, on the other hand, killed more native DLBCL cells than did doxorubicin. Patients with high Trx expression at the diagnostic stage of the disease benefitted from etoposide-containing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and did not develop post-transplantation relapses which Trx-negative patients did.Antithrombin III (AT III) in cerebrospinal fluid has been suggested to be a biomarker in previous studies of CNS lymphoma. In the present study, AT III was evaluated in patients with CNS lymphoma and with neurological diseases. High concentrations of AT III in cerebrospinal fluid reflected the magnitude of blood-brain barrier leakage and because of this, AT III should not be used as a biomarker in clinical practice.

This book demonstrates that the much-needed global shift in energy production and use must happen at a territorial level in order to be truly successful and sustainable. This book enables regional implementation efforts by connecting broad EU environmental policies with plans for action at the territorial level, analysing efficient resource allocation and cost effectiveness to achieve national objectives. Each EU Member State is considered in depth, in order to identify the opportunities and challenges of this regional approach. The regional dimension of the authors' analysis refers to the territorial level NUTS 1 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) that, starting from the administrative borders of the EU countries, divides the territory into 97 regions on the basis of major socio-economic characteristics. Because the model of the EU "green economy" is characterized typically by top-down interventions that focus exclusively on the resource productivity and investment business, its practical implementation can be de-railed. This book provides the pivotal missing piece- the detailed territorial comparative analysis necessary to obtain an optimal energy mix of renewable energy sources (RES), energy conservation and energy efficiency characteristics of each specific local context.

Regeneration of trees in the treeline ecotone : northern Finnish Lapland
The objective of our research was to find out if forest will invade the treeless areas in the present treeline ecotone in northern Finnish Lapland and which factors might impede forest advance. The field studies were carried out on Ailakkavaara near Kilpisjärvi, in the Pallastunturi area, and in northern Utsjoki(Rodjanoaivi, Koahppeloaivi-Staloskaidi, Jesnalvaara). In the Kilpisjärvi area and in northern Utsjoki only mountain birch is represented in the treeline ecotone, except for Jesnalvaara, where pine also occurs. In the Pallastunturi area, mountain birch, pine and spruce are represented in the treeline ecotone up to the treeline. In all study areas, a mosaic of widely scattered trees, tree groves and almost treeless subarctic dwarf shrub-lichen heath characterize the treeline ecotone. This mosaic is closely related to the locally varying topography and its influence on site conditions. In all the places, adverse physical and biological factors impede the forest from invading the present treeless areas within the treeline ecotone. Generally, seedlings are rare on top of wind-swept convex topography compared to better wind-protected snow-rich depressions such as little stream sides. Low or missing winter snow cover, ice particle abrasion, sand blast, and reindeer cause damage to seedlings and sparse young growth. Sandy till, typical of the ecotone on Rodjanoaivi, Koahppeloaivi and Staloskaidi (northern Utsjoki), is highly susceptible to wind erosion once the protecting plant cover has been destroyed. Thus, on the prevailing convex, wind-exposed topography, frequented by reindeer, the topsoil is eroded leaving the bare mineral soil exposed. Due to the sandy texture and lack of organic matter these sites drain rapidly. Drought and poor nutrient supply are most adverse to seedling establishment. In the other study areas (Ailakkavaara, Pallastunturi and also Jesnalvaara in northern Utsjoki) wind erosion is far less important. Seedlings are more frequent in wind-sheltered, snow-rich and moist shallow valleys and depressions. Altogether, our studies do not support the optimistic forecasts of a rapid advance of the forest to greater elevation. Even with warmer conditions the adverse effects of severe microclimate, drought and reindeer would override in spite of decades of slightly raised temperatures.
