The preservation of viable agricultural landscapes is essential in Finland and throughout Europe, because a considerable proportion of threatened species are associated with rural habitats, particularly various grasslands. In this study, the regional distribution of Finnish grasslands was studied using an existing nationwide digital land-use database. Further, the occurrence of traditional rural biotopes and selected butterfly and bird species living in different grassland habitats was investigated in relation to agricultural landscape mosaic. The results showed that grasslands were typically abundant in versatile agricultural regions, land uplift shores as well as in agriculturally marginal landscapes experiencing decrease of agricultural activities. Grasslands were generally scarce in intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes. The occurrence and siting of traditional rural biotopes in grassland networks vary greatly regionally, abundant and wellconnected traditional rural biotopes being found e.g. in river valleys and few isolated biotopes in intensively cultivated or agriculturally marginal, forested regions. Furthermore, the nationwide occurrence of selected butterfly and bird species was positively related to the abundance of grasslands. Overall, grasslands enrich the Finnish agricultural landscape both at the habitat and species level. In addition to species-rich semi-natural grasslands, other low-productive grasslands also hold significant potential in the maintenance of diverse agricultural environments.

The main objective of the study was to compare nutrient balances of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) on fertilized grass pasture (high input) and unfertilized grass-clover pasture (low input) both grazed by dairy cattle. The second aim was to quantify P loss in surface runoff from the fertilized grass pasture. The study was conducted on a lysimeter field that included two surface runoff collector ditches. The whole area was rotationally stocked five times per year and the amount of milk was recorded. Nutrient balances were negative on both grass and grass-clover pastures except the P balance for grass pasture, which was 18 kg ha-1 positive. The amount of total P in the surface runoff from fertilized grass pasture was 1.2-0.9 kg ha-1 y-1. It seems that in short-term ley farming, grass-clover swards can retain nutrients in the soil better than pure grass swards.
