Interpolation and approximation
B-splines are fundamental to approximation and data fitting, geometric modeling, automated manufacturing, computer graphics and numerical simulation. With an emphasis on key results and methods that are most widely used in practice, this book provides a unified introduction to the basic components of B-spline theory: approximation methods, modeling techniques and geometric algorithms. Topics discussed include the Bezier form; approximation and interpolation; error estimates; spline representations of curves, surfaces and solids; hierarchical bases; and finite element simulation.
