The first edition of this book ('American Social Studies, 1991') soon became the most widely used course book for American social studies in English departments at Swedish universities and colleges. The second edition (1997) maintained and strengthened this position into the new century. Starting with the third edition, the constantly evolving book has been titled Window on the United States. The fifth edition is thoroughly revised, providing an up-to-date survey of American geography, ethnic diversity, government, education, and social problems. It is intended primarily for university-level English-language courses in countries outside the United States, but it can also be of interest to general readers, including Americans. The author explains many basic concepts and phenomena with the foreign adult reader in mind and illustrates his points with numerous relevant examples. The web addresses that are listed at the end of each chapter for further reading are complemented by a dedicated Web site. This convenient forum enables readers to log on for fresh updates and to communicate more readily with both the author and other readers regarding issues presented in the book.

Few would dispute that we live in an unequal and unjust world, but what causes this inequality to persist? Leading social commentator and academic Danny Dorling claims in this timely book that in rich countries inequality is no longer caused by not having enough resources to share, but by unrecognised and unacknowledged beliefs which actually propagate it. Based on significant research across a range of fields, in Injustice Dorling argues that, as the five social evils identified by Beveridge at the dawn of the British welfare state are gradually being eradicated (ignorance, want, idleness, squalor and disease), they are being replaced by five new tenets of injustice, that: elitism is efficient; exclusion is necessary;prejudice is natural;greed is good and despair is inevitable. In an informal yet authoritative style, Dorling examines who is most harmed by these injustices and why, and what happens to those who most benefit. Hard-hitting and uncompromising in its call to action, this is essential reading for everyone concerned with social justice.
