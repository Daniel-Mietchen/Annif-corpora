The Routledge Handbook of Motor Control and Motor Learning offers a survey of neurophysiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of motor function. Adopting an integrative approach, it examines the full range of key topics in contemporary human movement studies, explaining motor behaviour in depth from the molecular level to behavioural consequences. The book contains contributions from many of the world's leading experts in motor control and motor learning, and is composed of five thematic parts: Theories and models Basic aspects of motor control and learning Motor control and learning in locomotion and posture Motor control and learning in voluntary actions Challenges in motor control and learning Mastering and improving motor control may be important in sports, but it becomes even more relevant in rehabilitation and clinical settings, where the prime aim is to regain motor function. Therefore the book addresses not only basic and theoretical aspects of motor control and learning but also applied areas like robotics, modelling and complex human movements.
