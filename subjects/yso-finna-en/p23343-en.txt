On the steel breeze
Children into swans : fairy tales and the pagan imagination
Mermaid ancestry can be traced from the classical past to the present. From her roots in Assyrian reliefs to inn signs, figureheads and tattoos, from the seductress of sailors to Picasso's mural of Syrena, the legends and folklore surrounding the mermaid remain as open to interpretation as the myths that have ensured her survival. She is blessed with one tail or two, as happy in freshwater as salt, and her line of descent runs from Homer's sirens to the nymphs in Pirates of the Caribbean. And what of the selkies, or seal-folk, or the fish-tailed maidens found entangled in fishermens nets? -- The earliest surviving images of mermaids date from 3,000 years ago. For much of her existence she has been an object of desire: in medieval bestiaries and pre-Raphaelite paintings, mermaids were symbols of lust and temptation. Only recently has the mermaid been reclaimed as neither vamp nor victim, but confident self-aware woman. Few creatures match her allure. A sexual hybrid, woman to the waist and fish below, her enduring popularity spans eras, continents and art forms.
