Diagnostic imaging : pediatric neuroradiology
"Diagnostic Imaging: Pediatric Neuroradiology, Second Edition is a useful tool for all health professionals involved in ordering, performing, or interpreting imaging studies of the child's brain, head, neck, spinal column, and spinal cord. The book consists of diagnoses of all common disorders of the pediatric nervous system and many that are not common. For each diagnosis, information is included concerning the clinical presentation(s) of affected patients, the best sequences to perform for imaging analysis, what each imaging sequence is expected to show (in both common and uncommon presentations), and examples of images showing the key features. In addition, information is included concerning the pathophysiology and pathology of the disorders being discussed, and some basic information concerning the causative genes (when appropriate). In addition to the diagnoses, the book contains introductory chapters in multiple sections that give background on basic embryology, anatomy, and physiology as well as typical imaging features of normal structures in areas being imaged. Put together, the contents of the book make it useful for readers of many different backgrounds and at nearly all stages of training as well as practicing health professionals. This beautiful second edition comes with Amirsys eBook Advantage, an online and searchable version of the book with linked references. In classic Amirsys style, both print and electronic content is viewable in easy-to-read bulleted lists supported by clearly described images. With a comprehensive overhaul, Diagnostic Imaging: Pediatric Neuroradiology, Second Edition promises to become another classic."--Provided by publisher.

"Edited by a renowned musculoskeletal radiologist and an internationally recognized Emergency Radiologist, and enhanced by contributions from invited acknowledged authorities, the Fifth Edition of this comprehensive reference is unsurpassed as a source of practical information on imaging of the acutely ill and injured patient during the acute phase of their emergent admission. Ideal for both the radiologist and for all members of the emergency team, the text builds upon current applications of plain-film radiography--while adding substantial coverage of other modalities, including MPCT and MRI. The fifth edition has again strived to keep up with the changing technology in diagnostic imaging in addition to emphasizing current practice in EDs and trauma centers. New chapters on imaging of skull fractures, maxillofacial trauma, chest trauma, and the acetabulum have been added to this volume to emphasize the importance of these areas with respect to imaging techniques and changes in clinical diagnosis and practice. In addition to redefining the importance of standard radiographs, the fifth edition has incorporated high-quality multidetector computed tomographic (CT) images, 3-D reformations, and magnetic resonance imaging to provide new information with evolving clinical practice" -- Provided by publisher.

Now in its eighth edition, "Torres' Patient Care in Imaging Technology" is trusted to develop the knowledge and skills that enable students to become safe and sensitive practitioners in every aspect of patient care. The text is designed to present key concepts effectively for beginning students as well as more advanced students and practitioners who want to improve their skills in patient care and imaging technology. "Torres' Patient Care in Imaging Technology" is a highly visual, focused, comprehensive text that presents key concepts, current trends, and advances in imaging technology and patient care in an engaging manner. The new edition includes an introductory chapter on radiography and contains expanded coverage of HIPAA and diversity. Two new features: cultural Considerations boxes and case Studies with critical thinking questions, build on the text's emphasis on helping students develop the skills needed to think critically and react appropriately in an actual clinical setting. The student-friendly writing style and logical organization allow instructors to cover the essentials of patient care in a limited amount of time. It is an illustration - and feature - rich approach enhances learning for students of multiple learning styles.
