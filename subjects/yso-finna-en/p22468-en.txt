My thesis was a comprehensive study on microfinance in Ghana. The purpose of this  thesis was to delve into the proliferation of microfinance companies in Ghana and its  associated challenges, the mode of establishment and operation. Part of this thesis  was to analyze the effects of the challenges and its impact on petty traders.  The theoretical part includes a description of the micro financing in the informal sector  with a brief history of the Ghanaian business system. Also, more light was shed  on what goes into the start-up phase of micro finance companies in Ghana from legal  regulations right to the licensing stage. The theory was based on information from  various credible websites and online publications.  This thesis was research based. Qualitative research data was employed in the empirical  part. A semi-structured interview was conducted with Pimcel Microfinance  Company. The results from this interview as well as the author's in-depth knowledge  of micro finance in Ghana played a big role in the thesis. Also, information gathered  from interactions with friends working in various microfinance institutions was deployed  in writing the empirical part of the thesis.

Market microstructure : confronting many viewpoints
The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize outlines his vision for a new business model that combines the power of free markets with the quest for a more humane world--and he tells the inspiring stories of companies that are doing this work today. In the last two decades, free markets have swept the globe, bringing with them enormous potential for positive change. But traditional capitalism cannot solve problems like inequality and poverty, because it is hampered by a narrow view of human nature in which people are one-dimensional beings concerned only with profit. In fact, human beings have many other drives and passions, including the spiritual, the social, and the altruistic. Welcome to the world of social business, where the creative vision of the entrepreneur is applied to today's most serious problems: feeding the poor, housing the homeless, healing the sick, and protecting the planet.--From publisher description.
