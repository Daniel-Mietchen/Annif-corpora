This paper exploits the fact that implied volatilities calculated from identical call and put options have often been empirically found to differ, although they should be equal in theory. We propose a new bivariate mixture multiplicative error model and show that it is a good fit to Nikkei 225 index call and put option implied volatility (IV). A good model fit requires two mixture components in the model, allowing for different mean equations and error distributions for calmer and more volatile days. Forecast evaluation indicates that in addition to jointly modeling the time series of call and put IV, cross effects should be added to the model: putside implied volatility helps forecast callside IV, and vice versa. Impulse response functions show that the IV derived from put options recovers faster from shocks, and the effect of shocks lasts for up to six weeks.

This paper presents a mixture multiplicative error model with a time-varying probability between regimes. We model the implied volatility derived from call and put options on the USD/EUR exchange rate. The daily first difference of the USD/EUR exchange rate is used as a regime indicator, with large daily changes signaling a more volatile regime. Forecasts indicate that it is beneficial to jointly model the two implied volatility series: both mean squared errors and directional accuracy improve when employing a bivariate rather than a univariate model. In a two-year out-of-sample period, the direction of change in implied volatility is correctly forecast on two thirds of the trading days.

This thesis aims at answering the question regarding the reasonability of real options valuation in the hotel industry by conducting a case study with the support of secondary and primary research.  By incorporating the value of individual capital investment opportunities into a project's gross  present value, real options valuation can be characterised as an extension of traditional valua-tion approaches such as the discounted cash flow methods, thereby reducing their uncertainty,  inflexibility, and incomprehensiveness.    Taking advantage of the analogy between financial and real options, institutionalised valuation methods such as the Black-Scholes formula (1973) or the binomial options pricing model by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) have been applied to evaluate different options of a real hotel investment project.     Although controversially discussed and so far practically unproven in the hotel industry due to a certain complexity, it is shown that it can be very valuable to incorporate real options into the valuation process.      Based on several simplifications and by recognising the need to investigate each individual option more in detail, this thesis reveals that the evaluation of real options can serve as an important decision base for hotel investors under the condition of a fairly certain future outlook and relatively stable environmental conditions.
