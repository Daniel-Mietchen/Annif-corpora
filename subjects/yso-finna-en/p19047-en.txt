The objective of this thesis was to conduct a thorough Business-to-Business market research of three selected target markets in China on Finnish language study material for the commissioning company-- Finn Lectura Oy. The main research question was to find out who forms the current market for Finnish language study material in China, which was broken down to four sub-questions to answer for a better understanding of the market situation.    The theoretical framework was built based on PESTLE, Porter's Five-force model, SWOT, marketing mix and B-to-B buying situation and process; a conceptual model was also designed by the author through analyzing the mentioned theories mostly from Kotler, Armstrong, Keller, Hollensen, Jobber, Blythe & Zimmerman, Brennan, Can-ning and McDowell.    The primary research part was carried out in the form of structured telephone interviews. Twelve interviews in total were conducted with staff members from relevant departments at existing and potential B-to-B customers during two separate phases due to the Chinese school winter holidays. The B-to-B customers are universities, schools, language training centers and book stores.    The results revealed that China is a young market for Finnish language material currently with great potentials. Since the supply has been very scarce in the market, and the demand on the other hand keeps growing at a rapid pace, Finn Lectura Oy, if willing to be the first “mover”, should be able to take over the majority of the market share.    In conclusion, this could be a good opportunity for Finn Lectura Oy to start contacting with the listed B-to-B customers in China and at the same time working out a strategic marketing plan in order to gain most of the sales in the Chinese market through the first entry.

The purpose of the thesis is to gather information about K-Rauta Kuninkoja's business-to-business customers, about their customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. This information is used to enhance K-Rauta's services and to create a stronger base for the customer relationships. Customers these days do not accept merely good customer service; they expect to be completely satisfied with the service they get. The companies cannot compete just with the products; they need to give the customer a personal experience. Loyal clientele is a significant advantage for a company. Loyal customers bring straightforward value, not only by their own transactions but also through the positive experiences shared with others. The path towards the customer satisfaction and moreover customer loyalty is a sum of different things and actions between the customer and the company. Often too much energy is spent for gaining new customers, without taking care of the existing ones. If the company fails on delivering the customer the level of satisfaction the customer expects, the relationship is failed. Due to the uniqueness of the Finnish hardware stores it is also an interesting area to do research of. This particular customer group was selected for the survey due to the lack of previous knowledge from them and due to their separation from the regular consumers. The results got from the customer survey supported the theory and proved the fact that even if the customers are merely satisfied with the stores services, it does not necessarily mean they would also be loyal towards the store. The results from the survey were positive towards K-Rauta Kuninkoja, but still the customers answered to use the other hardware stores more often. The survey proved that improving the level of satisfaction does not always need large investments. It can also be conducted by shaping the service processes and by gathering feedback from the customers regularly. The customers must also feel that their feedback is taken into account. Through these results K-Rauta Kuninkoja gets the ability to detect  their customers? needs and more precisely answer to them.

Nowadays, the biggest challenge in marketing is to get noticed in the big sea of competition. Companies are overwhelming customers with different kinds of marketing messages and information. Consequently, this makes them more reluctant to even read the messages and can lead to failure of the marketing campaign. This thesis was carried out as a research-based thesis for Lufthansa Cargo Finland & Baltic States. The objective was to study the connections between marketing communications and the behavior of the company's B2B customers. It aims to reveal which marketing communication tools are perceived as most effective and which attributes are seen as important in marketing messages. The approach of the thesis was deductive since the theoretical framework was based on the relevant theory (e.g. Fill, Hutt & Speh). The method applied in the empirical part of the study was quantitative. Following the theoretical analysis and the summarizing framework, an online survey was carried out with a total of 106 respondents from Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The distribution for the survey endured three weeks, from May 11th to June 1st 2010, after which the results were gathered, presented and analyzed. Based on the analysis, the framework model concerning the influences and effectiveness of marketing communications was revised and conclusions were made. In conclusion, the company's marketing communications are seen as satisfactory. It was confirmed that the increased shift from offline to online behavior has outplayed the use of traditional delivery channels. Electronically delivered marketing messages are favored the most and due to their speed and the fact that geographic location and time are not a concerning factor anymore, they are seen as highly convenient. However, personal communications, such as customer visits, are seen as most effective. Besides its high credibility and reliability, the fact that they offer a great possibility to build and strengthen relationships gives this tool such a strong benefit and makes it successful. To sum up, the findings indicate that certain attributes and characteristics, which B2B customers see as important, fluctuate depending on the marketing communication tools used and therefore make some tools more effective than others.

Theory part of this thesis were gathered from books. Most of the segments were found to not be profitable for CubiCasa to sell their products to at this time. The company operating in real estate business, Zillow, is the most relevant ones from these companies and segments because of the technology of CubiCasa and their production process. But even in the case of Zillow CubiCasa still have to wait until they have managed to create an almost fully automated production process on the floor plans.
