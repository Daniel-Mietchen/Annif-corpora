The goal of the thesis project was to design a concept prototype of a hand-held tool and to use components in the products the company has designed. The tool had to develop a 55kN force, maximum cycle time was four seconds and the hand part of the tool could weight no more than two kilograms. In the first phase goals were defined and the information was gathered on the projected loading cycle, lifetime, different solutions, components and techniques used in them. The solution concepts were compared using a morphological table and calculations files done with MatLab program. Based on the rankings and performance calculations, two basic design choices were compared: an electro-mechanical and an electro-hydraulic solution. The electro-hydraulic solution was chosen for further development. For it a new aluminium double acting hydraulic cylinder was designed along with a plastic tool body. Two different basic models of the tool were made for appraisal and one of them was chosen for development. The 3D-model, static loading simulations, 2D-drawings and initial failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) were done for this solution. Performance goals for the tool were met but the tool was 300 g over the weight limit set of two kilograms. The conclusions of this project are useful for the company as they can make a prototype based on 2D drawings and use the information gathered on further development of the tool. A thorough report of the work done is included in the report given to FELCO Motion SA. The public thesis focuses on the basic theory used in the project and on the design of the hydraulic cylinder.
Assessment of skin physiology is moving rapidly away from a purely descriptive approach as we gain a deeper understanding of biophysical and biochemical processes in the stratum corneum, such as those relating to its barrier function and hydration. As a result of research utilizing bioengineering methods, reliable and reproducible approaches are now available for product testing in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as well as in basic research. This book examines in detail all aspects of cosmetic testing -- legal, general, and practical. After discussion of regulatory and ethical issues and guidelines, essential guidance is provided on the planning, performance, and evaluation of scientific studies in skin physiology. The topics addressed range from laboratory and staffing requirements through to testing devices and methods, factors influencing measurements, and study design. In addition, detailed information is provided on test settings for a range of cosmetic products. All of the authors are recognized experts in their field. This book will be invaluable to researchers, students, and medical staff in explaining how best to assess skin functions in controlled studies using non-invasive biophysical instruments.
Product development teams are composed of an integrated group of professionals working from the nascent stage of new product planning through design creation and design review and then on to manufacturing planning and cost accounting. An increasingly large number of graduate and professional training programs are aimed at meeting that need by creating a better understanding of how to integrate and accelerate the entire product development process. This book is the perfect accompaniment and a comprehensive guide.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the leading business model in cloud-computing market. Not only in Oulu but also in Finland, SaaS businesses have been the key driver for the economy. However, to achieve success in building a SaaS start up, it requires a smart business strategy and an efficient product development process in order to not only compete with the competitor but also to achieve user satisfaction. motiMind is a young SaaS startup from Oulu, runs by a group of enthusiastic entrepreneurs and friends who have a long working history together from Nokia. Currently, motiMind is offering an innovative and complete way to monitor well-being and satisfaction of employee in organization. Their product packages streamline from collecting employees responses by mobile application to analysing the information through the system and show the result in the administration site. With the transparency and ease to use of the product, motiMind is on its way to grow further. In this thesis, studies will be conducted to understand how SaaS startups become successful, what the appropriate approach in product development is and how to apply it in motiMinds case.

Abstract: ANTS-Automated NetAct Testing Suite.
Infrastructure and mobile radio devices hardware can be roughly divided in three different sections: RF (Radio Frequency), DFE (Digital Front End) and BB (Baseband). RF and DFE sections can vary between different products, but usually the BB section is very similar. Because of this the testing of the Baseband section is also similar between different products and versions. The time between different product versions is rational to minimize to keep the product schedule of a product announcement on time. This fact brings a schedule pressure to a Research and Development testing. Products should be tested faster and the test coverage should be sufficient. This Master’s thesis was commissioned by Elektrobit Wireless Communications Oy. Infrastructure and mobile radio device planning belongs to their portfolio. The aim of this Thesis was to speed up and to ease the work of test designers and test operators. It was done by creating a ready test library for the research and development phase testing. The library contains basic information and examples about different tests done to a device under test. The same library will also help in measurement instruments acquisition and resource planning. SpiraTest test management software was used in test library generation. The purpose of the Automation is to investigate how Research and Development phase Baseband testing can be speed up. LabVIEW programming language was chosen to be used as automation tool. The main reason for its selection was the available device drivers. Clock signal quality measurement test was chosen to be automated. The oscilloscope setup for different signals and results saving was automated.

"The missing manual on how to apply Lean Startup to build products that customers love The Lean Product Playbook is a practical guide to building products that customers love. Whether you work at a startup or a large, established company, we all know that building great products is hard. Most new products fail. This book helps improve your chances of building successful products through clear, step-by-step guidance and advice. The Lean Startup movement has contributed new and valuable ideas about product development and has generated lots of excitement. However, many companies have yet to successfully adopt Lean thinking. Despite their enthusiasm and familiarity with the high-level concepts, many teams run into challenges trying to adopt Lean because they feel like they lack specific guidance on what exactly they should be doing. If you are interested in Lean Startup principles and want to apply them to develop winning products, this book is for you.This book describes the Lean Product Process: a repeatable, easy-to-follow methodology for iterating your way to product-market fit. It walks you through how to: Determine your target customers Identify underserved customer needs Create a winning product strategy Decide on your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Design your MVP prototype Test your MVP with customers Iterate rapidly to achieve product-market fit This book was written by entrepreneur and Lean product expert Dan Olsen whose experience spans product management, UX design, coding, analytics, and marketing across a variety of products. As a hands-on consultant, he refined and applied the advice in this book as he helped many companies improve their product process and build great products. His clients include Facebook, Box, Hightail, Epocrates, and Medallia.Entrepreneurs, executives, product managers, designers, developers, marketers, analysts and anyone who is passionate about building great products will find The Lean Product Playbook an indispensable, hands-on resource"--
