Virtue and vice, moral and epistemic
"Virtues and vices matter in both ethics and epistemology - it matters whether an agent has moral and intellectual virtues or moral and intellectual vices.

If so, how much do virtues and vices really matter? Are they - or are exemplars - at the foundation of moral and epistemic theory? And if virtues and vices do matter, what exactly are they? Virtue and Vice, Moral and Epistemic presents a series of thought provoking essays that delve deeply into the role of virtue and vice that cut across the fields of ethics and epistemology. Featuring the voices of both virtue ethicists and epistemologists, readings offer competing accounts of the foundation of moral theory while exploring the connections between virtue and emotion, and virtue and contextualism. Other essays analyze universal love, open-mindedness, epistemic malevolence, and epistemic self-indulgence.
