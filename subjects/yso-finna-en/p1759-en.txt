This thesis is a project oriented assignment which concentrates on the event promotion and sponsorship. The project is to implement the Guideline for Promoting Surf Events. The author is doing this guideline for the A.S.E.O. which is a surf association in Oaxaca, Mexico. The main objective of the A.S.E.O. is to organize surf events, mainly competitions, to improve the performance of its member surfers nationally and internationally. The primary objective of this thesis is to improve the event attraction of the surfing competitions. The author segments the different target groups and also analyses their needs. In July 2009, she made a questionnaire for the participants of the Surf and Music Festival. With the survey the author found more detailed information about the topic and she was able to use some results directly when implementing the guideline. The event sponsors are the most essential target group of the event marketing when it comes to the success of an event. The challenge for the event marketer is to convince the audience that the event is a one-of-a-kind experience, involving extreme sport. This thesis presents how to make these target groups interested in participating the events and by which marketing communication tools they can be reached. The thesis consists of the report and the Guideline for Promoting Surf Events (attached). The introduction of the report describes to the reader the background, the objectives and the stricture of the thesis. In the second chapter the author brings out the main theory frame concerning the topic by presenting which marketing communication tools can be used when improving the event publicity. The author combines different sources from the event marketing literature for example Allen, O'Toole and McDonnel's “Festival and special event management” and Hoyle's “Event Marketing: How to Successfully Promote Events, Festivals, Conventions, and Expositions”. The third chapter concentrates on the implementing the thesis output. This section shows which choices were taken when writing the Guideline for Promoting Surf Events. The author explains the reasons for the decisions and the evaluation of the importance and practicality. The last part of the thesis report is describing the conclusions of the whole project and it suggests how this thesis can make the activities of the A.S.E.O. easier in the future. Along with this thesis the association can start noticing the changes in the sport event industry and the changes in the behavior of different target groups.

Integrated Advertising, Promotion, and Marketing Communications speaks to an evolved definition of integrated marketing and teaches students (of marketing or otherwise) how to effectively communicate in the business world. This text covers advertising and promotions, but also the role of social media, blogs, mobile messaging, and other marketing tactics. As marketing has evolved to include more stealth approaches, so has the text. To help students retain ideas, each chapter includes tools that allow them to apply concepts to real-life situations.
