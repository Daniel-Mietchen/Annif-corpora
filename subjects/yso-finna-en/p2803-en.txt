Abstract. Tertiary amines are amines with three alkyl or aryl groups attached to a nitrogen atom. There are certain tertiary amines that form commercially useful products when let to react with hydrogen peroxide. These amines usually have 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the long carbon chain and two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. The types of products that form from this kind of reaction are called amino oxides. They are amines that have formed an additional covalent bond with an oxygen atom. In this thesis amine oxides were produced in a reaction calorimetric vessel. After the reaction data was evaluated, it was possible to answer the following questions about heat released during the reaction, specific heat capacity and maximum temperature of the reaction. Then, the produced amine oxides were examined by using differential scanning calorimetry to determine the properties the amine oxide has in high temperatures. The special object of interest was to see how the amine reacts and to identify the presence of water and amine in the sample. Finally, the heat release was determined to be approximately 106kJ/mol. The maximum temperature that the reaction could reach was 111.25°C on average, and therefore the adiabatic temperature rise of the reaction would be about 86.25 degrees, when assumed that 25°C is the lowest temperature for the reaction. According to the risk severity assessments table, these reactions possess a medium level of severity. From the differential scanning calorimetry signal can be said that the evaporation of the water and decomposition of the amine occur during the heating from 25°C to 250°C.

Phosphate barriers may mitigate dissolved P losses from critical source areas. We studied P retention of industrially produced Ca - Fe oxide as potential P barrier material. In batch tests with 1 mg l⁻¹ P solution, P retention was 85% efficient in 5 min. In a flow-through system, the granule phosphate-retention capacity was 6 - 7 mg g⁻¹, being largely unaffected by pre-leaching. Phosphate release from P-saturated granules was pH-dependant and suggested P association with Fe oxides, and as Ca-phosphate precipitates. In a sequential extraction of P-saturated granules, about 25% of retained P was released, whereas a separate anaerobic incubation resulted in negligible release of P. Immersion of unleached, P-saturated granules for 16 days in a low-P-concentration lake resulted in more than 80% Ca loss, but no loss of metals, and about 25% loss of P accumulated earlier in granules. These granules are promising for P retention and merit a field-scale study.

In response to the tightening emission legislation of marine and stationary engines, Wärtsilä has developed Wärtsilä NOx Reducer, in short, Wärtsilä NOR. Wärtsilä NOR is based on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology which has the purpose of nitrogen oxide emissions abatement from exhaust gas. The goal of this thesis was to plan a training area, a training cell, for Wärtsilä NOx Reducer in Wärtsilä Land & Sea Academy Turku Training Centre. The objective was to determine the efforts needed to establish it, the needed equipment and the training possibilities with the cell. In addition, planning of the cell layout and general operating instructions was required. This study was carried out as a project for Wärtsilä Training Development department. It included inspections at the Turku Training Centre, meetings and discussions with technical experts in Wärtsilä, and self-directed planning. The starting point was good since the premises for the training cell were suitable. The old SCR simulator was already on the site, and utilizing the associated equipment and facilities was considered a cost-efficient compromise. The simulator and its components were upgraded to match the current Wärtsilä NOR system. As a result, the thesis forms a proposal for SCR simulator with Wärtsilä NOR equipment, with a possibility to do several various training exercises, including commissioning and maintenance procedures. The layout, including the working areas, is planned as well. The outcome is a preliminary plan to provide support and background information when considering acquiring Wärtsilä NOR simulator equipment.
