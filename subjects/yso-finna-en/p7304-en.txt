In the growing body of research on sign language linguistics, one area onf inquiry considers an important compononent of all sign languages - handshapes - and whether the use of spesific shapes increases in direct relation to the ease of their formation. In this study, author Jean Ann provides significant clarification through an incisive assessment of Taiwanese sign language, a perfect model for bringing resolution to the handshape question.  Ann employs a straightforward methodology in her examination of the use of Taiwan sign language (TSL) handshapes in five succint chapters. In the first chapter, she discusses the two approaches linguistics have taken towards understanding languages, and how these theories have influences sign language researchers' consideration of the ease of articulation and frequency of handshapes. In her second chapter, Ann delineates the physiology of hands and explains why certain digits move with greater dexterity tha others. She applies this physiological information in the third chapter to construct a model for determining the ease of articulation of any logically possible handshape. She divides the handshapes into three categories, ranging from impossible to easy.  In the fourth chapter, Ann uses her model to examine the patterns of TSL, first by describing the 56 handshapes identified with TSL, then detrmining how often each is used. She then compares the usage data to the handshapes' ease of formation. The final chapter summarizes her findings and suggests implications of this work that are bound to generate further speculation and study of sign language handshapes in the future.
