"This book is a follow-up to our steady seller Natural Architecture. Presenting all new work by twenty artists not featured in the first volume as well as new projects by a selection of artists discussed in the first edition, Natural Architecture Now will showcase extraordinary spaces and exceptional structures created using natural materials and manual labor. The works make direct reference to the world of nature in terms of their location, the materials used, and a minimum application of non-artisan techniques. These are beautiful structures that use the resources of place, the specific characteristics of the site, growth processes, and spontaneous and accidental phenomena to investigate our feelings about nature, while addressing ecology, landscape, and environment as belonging to art"--

Becoming juniper : performing landscape as artistic research
This text consists of two parts, with an introduction and an epilogue. In the first part I discuss the notion of landscape briefly. In the second part I describe an example of a practice of performing landscape and discuss some of its aspects that might be useful for understanding or developing related practices. Finally, as an epilogue, I take up the question of how to speak of the environment.
