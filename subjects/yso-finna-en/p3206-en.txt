The return of the gift : European history of a global idea
"This book is a history of European interpretations of the gift from the mid seventeenth to the early twentieth century. Reciprocal gift exchange, pervasive in traditional European society, disappeared from the discourse of nineteenth-century social theory only to return as a major theme in twentieth-century anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy and literary studies. Modern anthropologists encountered gift exchange in Oceania and the Pacific Northwest and returned the idea to European social thought; Marcel Mauss synthesized their insights with his own readings from remote times and places in his famous 1925 essay on the gift, the starting-point for subsequent discussion. The Return of the Gift demonstrates how European intellectual history can gain fresh significance from global contexts"--Provided by publisher.

The objective of this thesis was to explore the mobility of students in Dalarna University and HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences. The main research question was how organizations and people reacted to the mobility issue, how they have done it, and what the present student mobility situation in HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences and Dalarna University is. Another aim was to find out the factors encouraging and preventing student exchange and to see what could be done in order to enhance the interest in exchange. The theoretical framework concentrates on organisational behaviour. The theory on barriers to trade enlightens how softer values may act as barriers for mobility even though the technical barriers have been removed. Strong organisational cultures and fear of change can be a burden when facing new situations and challenges, but the theory of resistance to change presents how these can be managed. In addition, the theory of rational decision-making demonstrates how to make decisions in order to optimise the desired outcome. The study was conducted by a qualitative research method. A few members of administrative staff and students were interviewed in both universities. These interviews were carried out both face-to-face and via e-mail. Data on student mobility in general in Sweden and Finland was gathered from different organisations and official institutions. Also the development of the Bologna process and its effects on educational organisations and thus mobility was studied. Although the empirical part of the thesis also includes researching overall student mobility in both countries, the findings and recommendations are limited to the aforementioned universities. The results show that there is cooperation between universities and mobility has been made easier, but HAAGA-HELIA students tend to study more abroad when compared to students from Dalarna. The reasons why Swedish students do not go abroad vary but are not altogether due to financial issues. More information on in-coming exchange students and students who have already been on exchange, comprehensive internet pages on exchange possibilities, and developed and smooth cooperation between universities and different organisations can be some methods that could make  students still hesitating more confident about exchange.

The thesis is about Welcome to Tampere fair 2008 and how the integration of the foreign students into Finnish society could be made easier with similar events and actions. In addition to the writing about integration, a theory about organizing fairs has also been written. The thesis was carried out to summarize the work done for the event and to see what else could be done to make the event even more purposeful. The integration of foreign students into our society is an important matter and the fair is one way to tackle the issue of integration.  Methods used to gather the data for the thesis were for primary data a questionnaire at the fair from the visitors as well as from the exhibitors & sponsors and for the secondary data different publications about integration and organizing fairs were used. Also the feedback from Welcome to Tampere 2009 was used to compare the results. Data from the questionnaire was used to evaluate the necessity of an event such as this and from the exhibitors' point of view how did they find the arrangements and did they find it worth a while to attend the fair. The secondary data was used to get a more in depth view of the matter of integration and also the process of organizing a fair. The secondary data's main purpose was to give more ideas how to get the fair more successful in the future by understanding the key elements of the problem. According to the feedback received it was a positive thing to arrange the event. It gave the students information about the city and this way had the wanted influence in the integration. Also the the feedback from the exhibitors and sponsors gave good ideas and suggestions how to even better in the coming years. The secondary data supported the results in both organizing a fair as well as in the integration process. The results of this thesis could be used as a guideline when organizing events that are alike in the future. With the given details many of the errors made could be avoided and similar events could be organized elsewhere as well. Next step for the cities in Finland is to boost up their images in the eyes of the foreign students by starting to make the integration much less complicated.

Trade schools, universities, and programs for international students have begun to experiment with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) as a viable pedagogy for instruction, as the pedagogy of CLIL increasingly gains recognition as a practical form of language and content education in Europe and beyond, and its application in instructional settings becomes more diverse. Corresponding with CLIL's growth, this book focuses on foreign language use during peer interactions in a new CLIL setting. It particularly concentrates on how to conduct research when the focus is on learner interactions. The theoretical background, research methods, and research instruments are explained in a brief and understandable manner. This book is intended for those interested in CLIL and peer interactions and includes a framework and ideas for investigating new CLIL contexts in a practical manner allowing undergraduate and graduate students to conduct their own research in these settings.

The emergence over the last 10 years of the analytic concept, 'Translanguaging', has had a forceful impact on the field of Applied Linguistics. This book addresses how it has contributed to our understandings of language, bilingualism and education. Ofelia Garcia and Li Wei trace the development of the theory of Translanguaging and consider its relationship with traditional theories and models of language and bilingualism. Based on practices by students and teachers in a variety of educational contexts, this book describes how Translanguaging is used by bilingual learners to learn and by teachers to teach. Ultimately, the book affirms the transformative nature of Translanguaging; it involves the act of languaging between and beyond systems that have previously been described as separate, and in so doing, new meanings emerge and new understandings are generated, transforming not only semiotic systems and speaker subjectivities, but also social structures.

In Making Things Better, A. David Napier demonstrates how anthropological description of non-Western exchange practices and beliefs can be a tonic for contemporary economic systems in which our impersonal relationship to "things" transforms the animate elements of social life into inanimate sets of commodities. Such a fundamental transformation, Napier suggests, makes us automatons in globally integrated social circuits that generate a cast of a winners and losers engaged in hostile competition for wealth and power. Our impersonal relations to "things"-and to people as well-are so ingrained in our being, we take them for granted as we sleepwalk through routine life. Like the surrealist artists of the 1920s who, through their art, poetry, films, and photography, fought a valiant battle against mind-numbing conformity, Napier provides exercises and practica designed to shock the reader from their wakeful sleep. These demonstrate powerfully the positively integrative social effects of more socially entangled, non-Western orientations to "things" and to "people." His arguments also have implications for the rights and legal status of indigenous peoples, which are drawn out in the course of the book.

"International Teaching and Learning at Universities investigates both the positive and the more problematic aspects of the internationalization of education. The flow of students to universities is no longer unidirectional from East to West but truly global with a diminishing difference between the two major educational centers. Slethaug and Vinther explain how liberal education, the movement of students across the globe, autonomy for students and teachers, and internationalization of education influence each other in constructing a new educational reality. These elements are vital to the continued development of learning, economic growth, and the democratic process of our societies in the East and West"--

"It is the present-day, and the world is as we know it: smartphones, social networking and Happy Meals. Save for one thing: the Civil War never occurred.  A gifted young Black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service. He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called "the Hard Four." On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right - with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself.  A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child who may be Victor's salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all - though his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface. Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost. Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe"--
