Abstract: The impact of in-store customer service on postpurchase impulse-buying behaviour : a case study based on Gallery, a street fashion store. The purpose of this study is to research how in-store customer service can affect satisfied impulse purchasers' postpurchase behaviour in terms of store returns. The results of this study revealed that in-store customer service can positively affect impulse-buyers' postpurchase evaluations of service, and by increasing the level of in-store service the sales personnel can influence the customers' cognitions, and move an initial impulse purchase into a permanent adoption (Kang & Johnson, 2009). This in return can minimise store returns. This study provides information as to why in-store customer service should be considered as a part of the strategic store environment, and how service-oriented emphasis can influence impulse-buying behaviour.
