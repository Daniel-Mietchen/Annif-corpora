The First Comprehensive Guide to Educational Interpreting As many as 22,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students are currently enrolled in local school programs where their access to the language of learning is dependent upon an interpreter. This book brings together comprehensive information about the practice of interpreting in educational settings. As the author points out, the field of educational interpreting has developed quickly in recent years, creating the need for this practical guide to serve as a resource for interpreters, general education teachers, special education teachers, special education directors, parents, speech-language pathologists, school administrators, and others concerned with the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The book takes a developmental approach to curriculum and instruction regarding students who use interpreters, moving from preschool on through the graduate school. The topics covered relate to the specific needs of learners at each age and apply to interpreters who use sign language, cued speech, and oral interpreting. Each section is presented in a question-answer format, with an emphasis on the challenges posed by interpreting in educational setting and the practices best suited to meeting those challenges. For each of the educational settings, engaging case studies focus on real-life situations and are followed by suggested best-practice solutions as well as questions for further thought.
