The customer of this project is Dometalot Ltd company. It is a Finnish construction company specialized in the creating and building of individual passive houses. The type of this thesis is research task. The goal of this research is to measure and comparethe sound insulation characteristics of different types of Dometalotâ€™s wall structures and one basic wall structure. The research in this thesis is divided into two parts. The first of them is an analysis of standards by the International Organization for Standardization. The description and analysis of the research is presented in the second part of this thesis. The method of measurement of airborne sound insulation of internal wall is the consistent measurement and comparison of the average sound pressure level on the premises.The main used materials are standards ISO 10140. The drawings of the walls were created with AutoCAD program. The company can use the results of the research in the future to improve their wall structures.
Structure as Architecture presents a comprehensive analysis of the indispensable role of structure in architecture. An exploration, as well as a celebration, of structure, the book draws on a series of design studies and case study examples to illustrate how structure can be employed to realize a wide range of concepts in contemporary architecture. By examining design principles that relate to both architecture and structural engineering, Andrew Charleson provides new insights into the relationship between both the technical and aesthetic aspects of architecture. Now in its second edition, the text has been extensively revised and updated throughout. Features include: * A brand new chapter on hidden structure, adding to the material on exposed structures * Two new chapters on using structure to realise common architectural concepts through a combination of precedents and creative design * Over 50 new case studies from across the globe * Easy-to-understand diagrams and a highly visual design to aid understanding and accessibility More than two hundred case studies of contemporary buildings from countries such as the UK, the US, France, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan illustrate how a thorough integration of structure adds layers of richness and enhances the realisation of architectural design concepts.
