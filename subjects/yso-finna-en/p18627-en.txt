During recent years, research in developmental psychology has yielded many new insights into the minds of young children and a number of widely accepted notions are now having to be reconsidered. This book presents a balanced selection of that research and provides an editorial commentary which, by making clear the connections and implications, helps to create an overall picture. What emerges is that by the time children come to school they already possess many highly developed skills as thinkers, language-users and social beings. However, in addition to learning new skills, they are then required to display many of their existing ones in novel and unfamiliar ways. If they are to do this successfully they need help that is based on a good understanding both of their strengths and of their limitations. These papers will contribute to the growth of this understanding. Their practical value for developmental and educational psychologists and for teachers in training and in practice will be completely clear.

"For developmental scientists, the nature versus nurture debate has been settled for some time. Neither nature nor nurture alone provides the answer. It is nature and nurture in concert that shape developmental pathways and outcomes, from health to behavior to competence. This insight has moved far beyond the assertion that both nature and nurture matter, progressing into the fascinating terrain of how they interact over the course of development. In this volume, students, practitioners, policy analysts, and others with a serious interest in human development will learn what is transpiring in this new paradigm from the developmental scientists working at the cutting edge, from neural mechanisms to population studies, and from basic laboratory science to clinical and community interventions. Early childhood development is the critical focus of this volume, because many of the important nature-nurture interactions occur then, with significant influences on lifelong developmental trajectories"--Provided by publisher.

"Research shows that poor language and communication skills have a profound effect on the life chances of children and young people. This highly practical book will enable you to give children in your care the help they need to build their language skills at the earliest point in their development. Based on the author's highly regarded SPIRALS language development programme, the book provides 40 tried and tested sessions to help develop children's early speech, language and communication. Each language concept is introduced one at a time and builds on the most frequently used words by infants and uses music, repetition and simple meaningful gestures and signing to reinforce children's understanding. Features include: - Concise explanations of the terms and concepts involved - Clear guidelines for setting up and running individual and group sessions - Ideas for progression - Suggestions for involving parents - Photocopiable resources - Lists of further reading and resources Written by a leading authority in the field, this exciting new resource provides everything you need to support young children's language skills at the earliest point in their development"--

"It is widely known that babies and infants will flourish in an environment that supports and promotes their learning and development. But what constitutes an appropriate environment for children under three? Drawing on recent research, this book explores the concept of an appropriate environment, both within and beyond the early years setting. It sets this within the context of child development and practically demonstrates how a high quality environment can be created for babies and children under three that supports their learning and development. Features include: - clear explanation of relevant theories - case studies and examples of good practice - focus points for readers - questions for reflective practice Providing a wealth of practical ideas and activities, this handy text provides detailed guidance on how to develop an appropriate indoor and outdoor environment for babies and children under three to help practitioners ensure effective outcomes for the youngest children in their care"--.
