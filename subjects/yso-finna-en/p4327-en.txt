Economic value added : a simulation analysis of the trendy, owner-oriented management tool
The globalised business environment has forced companies to improve efficiency, cost effectiveness and transparency especially in their support functions, such as financial administration. The strategy in many multinational enterprises has been to standardize business processes internationally and to jointly provide a specialized service from a Center of Excellence (CoE) for the local units in different countries. Introducing uniform processes for countries that have their own characteristics in business environment is not an easy task. The objective of this study was to examine the post-implementation challenges that have arisen in centralizing finance processes to off shore Centers of Excellence, focusing on one case company, Oy International Business Machines Ab (IBM Finland). IBM is the world's largest technology and consulting employer, with clients from 170 countries. The company has been one of the forerunners on international operating models. This study gives examples on the transfer of IBM Finland's treasury function to an in-house Center of Excellence in Bratislava in autumn 2010. The transfer was a part of IBM's Finance Transformation strategy which leads the enterprise towards a centralized operating model. The theoretical part discusses the background, reasoning and evaluation for centralizations in large multinational enterprises as well as the future insights within the phenomenon according to recent research articles. The empirical data was collected using thematic interviews in the case company with the finance professionals both in Finland and in the Treasury Center of Excellence in Slovakia. The findings of the study indicate that centralization has both soft, people related challenges and challenges in the process itself. The new operating model requires a broader set of skills from the finance specialists. The special characteristics of processes in different countries lead to the continued obligations for the country units to assist in the function, which is a great challenge since in the global operating model, country units struggle for resources. It is essential to find a balance for resources in the CoE and the country units to ensure continuity of knowhow and the required quality of the service.

Financial management and policy
This paper surveys the literature on ownership structure and corporate governance in Russia.The market structure is compared to traditional German and Anglo-Saxon market models.We argue that the Russian market constitutes a dynamic hybrid of the two models, i.e. its direction of development has yet to be resolved.As several current cases indicate, the risk of unfair treatment of minority shareholders in Russian companies is considerable.While we acknowledge that both the legal framework and the incentives of the management are equally important in protecting minority shareholder rights, the scope of the paper is deliberately limited to discussion of the legal framework.The information disclosure requirements of Russian companies are compared with the US requirements.Also the regulatory bodies in the two countries are discussed.Some differences between International Accounting Standards and Russian accounting practice are also reviewed.The final part of the paper is dedicated to the recent reforms proposed by the Russian government regarding disclosure and protection of minority shareholder rights. Keywords: ownership structure, shareholders, information disclosure, FCSM, Russia .
