Following on from the successful first edition of Waste Treatment & Disposal, this second edition has been completely updated, and provides comprehensive coverage of waste process engineering and disposal methodologies. Concentrating on the range of technologies available for household and commercial waste, it also presents readers with relevant legislative background material as boxed features. NEW to this edition: Increased coverage of re-use and recycling Updating of the usage of different waste treatment technologies Increased coverage of new and emerging technologies for waste treatment and disposal A broader global perspective with a focus on comparative international material on waste treatment uptake and waste management policies.

Food Industry Wastes: Assessment and Recuperation of Commodities presents emerging techniques and opportunities for the treatment of food wastes, the reduction of water footprint, and creating sustainable food systems. Written by a team of experts from around the world, this book will provide a key resource for implementing processes as well as giving researchers a starting point for the development of new options for the recuperation of these waste for community benefit. There were over 34 million tons of food waste generated in the US alone in 2009 - at a cost of approximately $43 billion. And while less than 3% of that waste was recovered and recycled, there is growing interest and development in finding ways to utilize this waste in ways that will not only reduce greenhouse gasses, but provide energy, and potentially provide resources for other purposes. Food waste is an area of focus for a wide range of related industries from food science to energy and engineering. This international authoring team represents the leading edge in research and development. Provides insights on leading areas of current research as well as looking toward future opportunities for reusing food waste.

Textile exerts various environmental impacts throughout its life cycle. Prevention of textile waste is one means to reduce these impacts. This study seeks to map-out the flow of textile products in the three Nordic Countries - Denmark, Finland and Sweden - from the time they are put on the market until they are discarded. Based on the findings on the flows as well as on the perception of stakeholders, the study reviews and discusses government interventions that may be useful for the enhancement of textile waste prevention. Potential use of various policy instruments based on the concept of extended producer responsibility (EPR) is analysed. The study indicates a handful of areas where further research is needed in order to fine-tune policy actions that would best address the situation specific to the case countries.
