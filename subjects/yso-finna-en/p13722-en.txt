In this book, leading researchers consider how media inform democracy in six countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Taking as their starting point the idea that citizens need to be briefed adequately with a full and intelligent coverage of public affairs so that they can make responsible, informed choices rather than act out of ignorance and misinformation, contributors use a comparative approach to examine the way in which the shifting media landscape is affecting and informing the democratic process across the globe. In particular, they ask: Can a comparative approach provide us with new answers to the question of how media inform democracy? Has increased commercialization made media systems more similar and affected equally the character of news and public knowledge throughout the USA and Europe? Is soft news and misinformation predominantly related to an American exceptionalism, based on the market domination of its media and marginalized public broadcaster? This study combines a content analysis of press and television news with representative surveys in six nations. It makes an indispensable contribution to debates about media and democracy, and about changes in media systems.

From the publisher. In the spring of 1994, after decades of intermarrying and living in relative harmony with each other, Rwandan Hutus, en masse, went on a murderous rampage against their Tutsi neighbors. By the end of just three months, nearly three-quarters of the entire Tutsi population had been exterminated. This swift, appalling genocide followed a relentless propaganda campaign broadcast from government-controlled radio, which for over three years had demonized Rwandan Tutsis. What role do the media have in creating the conditions for atrocities such as occurred in Rwanda? Conversely, can the media be used to preserve democracy and safeguard the human rights of all citizens in a diverse society? How will the media, now global in scope, affect the fate of the planet itself. Veteran journalist Maria Armoudian explores these intriguing questions and more in this in-depth examination of the media's power to either help or harm. Armoudian begins by documenting how the media were used to spread a contagion of hate in three deadly conflicts: Rwanda, Nazi Germany, and the former Yugoslavia. She then turns to areas of the world where the media acted constructively -- by aiding the peace process in Northern Ireland, rebuilding democracy in Chile, bridging ethnic divides in South Africa, improving the lot of women in Senegal, and boosting transparency and democratization in Mexico and Taiwan. Finally, she explains how the media interact with psychological and cultural forces to impact perceptions, fears, peer-pressure, "groupthink," and the creation of heroes and villains. This wide-ranging, insightful book will make readers keenly aware of the media's power, while underscoring the role that we all play in fostering a media climate that cultivates a greater sense of humanity, cooperation, and fulfillment of human potential.
The transformation of political communication : continuities and changes in media and politics
Political journalism : new challenges, new practices
"This book offers new and compelling insight into the emergent shared culture of the relationship between political actors and journalists in nine European democracies. It is a truly comparative account of the attitudes of 2,500 political communication elites between Helsinki and Madrid on various aspects of the media's role in politics and on the mutual relationship of politicians, political spokespersons and journalists. The study identifies national political communication cultures across Europe over the importance of journalists in advocacy and commentary, pressures on the media and perceived political influence. It also highlights that professional roles determine the perception of news-making, the interpretation of daily political life and the ethos of professional conduct and interaction. "--

"Peycam looks at how the journalism that came out of colonial Saigon became a powerful tool for political activism, and a vehicle for mobilizing and unleashing popular forces. The manuscript covers the evolution of Vietnamese journalism in colonial Saigon from its inception (before 1916) to its transformation beginning in 1930, with the impact of the Great Depression on the one hand and the onset of mass protest movements on the other. Inspired by Habermas, the author argues that what contemporary Vietnamese called the "newspaper village" journalism created an unprecedented public sphere in which all sorts of issues could be and were debated. He also traces its gradual shift from a forum for advocacy and debate to a vehicle for popular mobilization, as many of those who became journalists saw newspapers more as vehicles for the expression of opinions than for the dissemination of information. By looking at the links between colonial capitalism and new possibilities for self-expression and nationalism, Peycam illuminates the role of the colonial state in setting the parameters for journalistic activities, subsidizing those it wished to use as its propaganda instrument and fighting those it deemed inimical to its interests."--Publisher's description.

"In the twenty-first century, the advent of digital photography, camera phones and social media platforms has altered the relationship between photographers, the medium and the audience- as well as contributing to an ongoing blurring of the boundaries between news and entertainment and professional and amateur journalism. The Violence of the Image explores how new vernacular and artistic modes of photographic production articulate international friction."--Page 4 of cover.
