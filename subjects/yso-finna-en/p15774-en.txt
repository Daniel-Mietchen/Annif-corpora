Drawing upon economic history, cultural studies, intellectual history and the history of science and medicine, this collection of case studies examines the transatlantic transfer and transformation of goods and ideas, with particular emphasis on their reception in Europe. It critiques and enriches Atlantic history and the history of consumption by highlighting a degree of resistance to unfamiliar goods and information as well as the asymmetrical and violent nature of many types of exchange. It considers agents who forged networks and relations within and beyond the Spanish Empire, including Jesuit missionaries, Sephardic merchants, African laborers and farmers from Oaxaca to Santo Domingo to the Piedmont. While uniting increasingly homogenous and connected societies, the expansion of European horizons also generated diverse interests and divergent material cultures.

Textiles are a key component of the industrial, industrious and consumer revolutions, which are seen as transforming the economy, society and culture of Western Europe during the long eighteenth century. Yet we lack a coherent picture of how the marketing of textiles varied across time and between different regions and countries. This book provides important new insights into the ways in which changes in the supply of textiles related to shifting patterns of demand, not just in terms of imported novelties such as chintz, but also more traditional, locally-produced and even second-hand textiles. It focuses on the processes and practices of retailing, and assesses how these responded to and promoted wider changes in value systems and supply networks. It encompasses discussion of fashion and taste, advertising and pricing, cultural norms and local tradition, cleanliness and hygiene, shopkeepers and stock.

"In this timely books, Theodore Koutsobinas explores the system of status markets and their social effects including inequality. He explains how media fascination with superstars and luxury consumption goods amplify positional concerns for all, distort aspirations of the middle class and cause relative deprivation. Building on themes first identified by Veblen and Galbraith, the author analyses extensively the behavioural evidence from modern interdisciplinary research and contributes constructively to a new genre of economic analysis. The Political Economy of Status compels us to seriously consider redistributive culture change policies targeted to assist the underprivileged. This book will be a valuable resource for academics in various fields including economic theory, political economy, sociology, social psychology and cultural studies" --Back cover.
