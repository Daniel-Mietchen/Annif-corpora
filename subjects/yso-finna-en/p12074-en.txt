The purpose of this study was to determine if differences existed when dysarthric speech was evaluated using three measures, intelligibility, comprehensibility and acceptability using younger and older typical adults as listeners. Intelligibility, an objective measure, was defined as percent of words heard correctly, comprehensibility, also an objective measure, as the ability to understand what is being said, and acceptability, a subjective measure, as how the listener rates the person's overall speaking ability. Four young adult males with traumatic brain injury and one control were recorded reading sentences from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS). Sentences were played back to younger and older listeners who provided all ratings. All ratings by both groups were high for intelligibility and comprehensibility. Ratings for acceptability indicated a group difference with older listeners rating acceptability similar to intelligibility and comprehensibility, while younger listeners rated acceptability at significantly lower levels compared to the other to measures. Results suggest that counseling may be necessary for younger TBI patients and their families to overcome possible peer rejection despite the fact that the patients actually produce highly intelligible and understandable speech.

Essential for professionals in school settings, this book helps readers establish a beginning functional communicative repertoire for learners with severe disabilities. Professionals will start with an in-depth intervention framework, including a guide to AAC modes and technologies, variables to consider when selecting AAC, and how AAC research can be used to support practice. Then they'll get explicit, evidence-based instructional strategies they'll use to help children and young adults initiate, maintain, and terminate an interaction.

"Focusing on the anatomic concepts that speech-language pathology students must master, Atlas of Neuroanatomy for Communication Science and Disorders is a user-friendly guide to the neural basis of human communication and brain-based disorders. With this book, students will acquire a full understanding of the basic anatomy and physiology of human communication; the neural mechanisms controlling speech, language, cognition, and swallowing functions; the anatomic underpinnings of speech-language disorders of the nervous system and related communication impairments; and much more. Features an extraordinary, full-color visual library of labeled anatomic illustrations, from Thieme's world-renowned Atlas of Anatomy Series"--Provided by publisher.

Language is integral to our social being. But what is the status of those who stand outside of language The mentally disabled, wild children, people with autism and other neurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificial intelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders. In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the "disarticulate", those at the edges of language, have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles. Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such as Billy Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise, and The Echo Maker, among others, the author shows in this study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Here the author argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.
