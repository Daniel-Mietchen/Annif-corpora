Everyone has the capacity to dance right now. With A Sense of Dance, you will learn about the physical expression of dance, gain confidence in your movement potential, and discover your own creativity. Written in a conversational tone, this interactive text will inspire you to develop creative thinking, reasoning skills, and self-expression. Through the use of examples and exercises based on nonstudio experiences, you'll learn how to translate your life experiences into the art of dance. You'll also acquire the tools necessary to appreciate, discuss, and write about dance as a fine art. Plus you'll find your own voice as a choreographer and a dance appreciator. In this book you'll find important information on the ways we use our bodies to be expressive, how we instinctively apply the elements of dance in daily life, dance exploration basics and the elements of movement, how to develop your own dance perceptions and creative resources, and how to translate your perceptions into dance. Whatever your level of artistic awareness, this engaging text will help you tap into the power and energy of dance.

In sport disciplines such as running, ice skating, bicycling and cross-country skiing the aerodynamic drag force constitutes the major obstacle to overcome. Furthermore, in ski jumping and in various activities involving a ball the aerodynamic lift force comes in addition into action. This book describes the various sport disciplines on the basis of aerodynamic analysis and also covers the biomechanics part by illustrative performance examples. Such treatment of the underlying physical phenomena of sport activities gives a valuable supplement to existing literature on sport. The reader will also be guided to references which exist for the various topics discussed, so she or he can go into a deeper study of the particular sport activity at wish.
