Dance Production: Design and Technology introduces you to the skills you need to plan, design, and execute the technical aspects of a dance production. While it may not seem that staging a dance production is that different from a play or musical, in reality a dance performance offers up unique intricacies and challenges all its own, from scenery that accommodates choreography, to lighting design that sculpts the body, and costumes that complement movement. This unique book approaches the process of staging a dance production from a balanced perspective, making it an essential resource for dancers and designers alike. Covering a broad range of topics, author Jeromy Hopgood takes the reader through the process of producing dance from start to finish - including pre-production planning (collaboration, production process, personnel, performance spaces), design disciplines (lighting, sound, scenery, costumes, projections), stage management, and more. Bridging the gap between theatrical and dance design, the book includes a quick reference guide for theatrical and dance terminology, useful in giving dancers and designers a common working vocabulary that will ensure productive communication across the different fields.

What does a “producer” actually do? How does one travel from that great idea for a show to a smash hit opening night on Broadway? John Breglio cannot guarantee you a hit, but he does take the reader on a fascinating journey behind-the-scenes to where he himself once stood as a child, dreaming about the theatre. Part memoir, part handbook, I wanna be a producer is a road map to the hows and wherefores, the dos and don'ts of producing a Broadway play, written by a Broadway veteran with more than 40 years of experience. This comprehensive and highly informative book features practical analysis and concepts for the producer – and is filled with entertaining anecdotes from Breglio's illustrious career as a leading theatrical lawyer and producer. Breglio recounts not only his first-hand knowledge of the crucial legal and business issues faced by a producer, but also his experiences behind the scenes with literally hundreds of producers, playwrights, composers, and directors, including such theatre luminaries as Michael Bennett, Joe Papp, Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Patti Lupone, August Wilson, and Mel Brooks. Whether you are a working or aspiring producer, an investor, or are just curious about the backstage reality of the theater, Breglio shares his knowledge and experience of the industry, conveying practical information set against the real-life stories of those who have devoted their lives to the craft.

This thesis is a written report on the event management process of the annual corporate client event of GNT Finland in October 2008. The emphasis in the project description lies in the implementation of the event theme "Hevi Horror". The thesis is commissioned by the Event Management company responsible for the event supervision and production: BSG Marketing Ltd / Eventgarden. The report is written in the perspective of the author who serves as the event manager and producer of the event. The report is divided into an introduction giving an overview of the project and its broader frame, the theoretical frame of reference and the project description providing a detailed overview of the work involved, the project results and the project evaluation and analysis. The project is described based on the logical order of the theoretical part of the report: from the event analysis phase, over the event planning and implementation phase to the event evaluation. The analysis phase was carried out starting in March 2008, planning and implementation of the event was done from that time until the actual event on 3.10.2008 and the event evaluation process lasted until February 2009. Key results of the project describe the implementation of the event theme throughout all event elements: the event venue, sounds, lights and audiovisuals, the event entertainment and activities, the event catering and the event décor and props. The author describes in detail the results of the design of the overall event atmosphere, as well as the sourcing process for all related suppliers. A critical evaluation of the event management process is given in the last part of the thesis report. The author presents suggestions for improvement within in the own completion of tasks. For the commissioning party the report can serve as a guideline for improving the internal project management, particularly regarding the supplier sourcing process.

Over the last three decades, one music producer and record man has transformed the business, discovering and producing some of the greatest acts in pop music history, including Toni Braxton, Kanye West, Rihanna, TLC, Outkast, Mariah Carey, Pink, Justin Bieber, and Usher. At the helm of four celebrated and innovative music labels--LaFace, Arista, Island Def Jam, and Epic--LA Reid set his sights on finding one star after the next, and then worked behind the soundboard to create some of the most unforgettable hits of the last two generations. Now, for the first time, he tells his story, taking fans behind the scenes of his rise to record business stardom. He chronicles the journey from his small-town R&B roots in Cincinnati, Ohio, to his fame as a Grammy Award-winning producer to his gig as a judge on the hit reality show The X Factor. With fascinating insight into his process of scouting new talent, Reid also offers a detailed look at his involvement with the artists he's mentored into legends--from the beginning of their rises to that critical moment when he knew they would be the next big thing. What emerges is a captivating portrait of the inner workings of the pop music machine, and the story of a man climbing to the top on passion and raw talent alone, a multifaceted genius who continues to shape our culture to this day.--Adapted from dust jacket.
