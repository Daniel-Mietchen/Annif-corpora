"While people are now using peer-to-peer (P2P) applications for various processes, such as file sharing and video streaming, many research and engineering issues still need to be tackled in order to further advance P2P technologies. Peer-to-Peer Computing: Applications, Architecture, Protocols, and Challenges provides comprehensive theoretical and practical coverage of the major features of contemporary P2P systems and examines the obstacles to further success.Setting the stage for understanding important research issues in P2P systems, the book first introduces various P2P network architectures. It then details the topology control research problem as well as existing technologies for handling topology control issues. The author describes novel and interesting incentive schemes for enticing peers to cooperate and explores recent innovations on trust issues. He also examines security problems in a P2P network. The final chapter addresses the future state of the field. Throughout the text, the highly popular P2P IPTV application, PPLive, is used as a case study to illustrate the practical aspects of the concepts covered.Addressing the unique challenges of P2P systems, this book presents practical applications of recent theoretical results in P2P computing. It also stimulates further research on critical issues, including performance and security problems"--

Design and implementation of mobile peer-to-peer application
Energy efficiency is a powerful measure for promoting sustainability in technological evolution and ensuring feasible battery life of end-user devices in mobile computing. Peer-to-peer technology provides decentralized and self-organizing architecture for distributing content between devices in networks that scale up almost infinitely. However, peer-to-peer networking may require lots of resources from peer nodes, which in turn may lead to increased energy consumption on mobile devices. For this reason, peer-to-peer networking has so far been considered unfeasible for mobile environment. This thesis makes several contributions towards enabling energy-aware peer-to-peer networking in mobile environments. First, an empirical study is conducted to understand the energy consumption characteristics of radio interfaces and typical composition of traffic in structured peer-to-peer networks. This is done in order to identify the most essential obstacles for utilizing peer-to-peer technology in mobile environments. Second, the e-Aware model for estimating the energy consumption of a mobile device is developed and empirically verified to achieve 3-21% error in comparison to real-life measurements. Third, the e-Mon model for the energy-aware load monitoring of peer nodes is developed and demonstrated to improve the battery life of mobile peer nodes up to 470%. Fourth, the ADHT concept of mobile agent based virtual peers is proposed for sharing the peer responsibilities between peer nodes in a subnet so that they can participate in a peer-to-peer overlay without compromising their battery life.The results give valuable insight into implementing energy-efficient peer-to-peer systems in mobile environments. The e-Aware energy consumption model accelerates the development of energy-efficient networking solutions by reducing the need for time-consuming iterations between system development and evaluations with real-life networks and devices. The e-Mon load monitoring model facilitates the participation of battery-powered devices in peer-to-peer and other distributed networks by enabling energy-aware load balancing where energy-critical mobile nodes carry less load than other nodes. The ADHT facilitates the participation of constrained-capacity wireless devices, such as machine-to-machine nodes, in a peer-to-peer network by allowing them to sleep for most of their time.

"Preface Peer-to-peer computing, at least on a conceptual level, is a genuine paradigm shift--intelligence is at the edge, computing is completely decentralized, and the network is just there to knit the distributed intelligence together. Indeed, with advancements in hardware technology, proliferation of the open source development culture, and abundant information at our fingertips, computing power and user competence at the edge of the network has risen to an unprecedented level. Thus, devices at the edge (not restricted to desktop PCs) can congregate and share their resources (computing power, file data, etc.) to provide services to participating users in a self-sufficient manner, without the need of dedicated servers. With potentially up to millions of machines participating simultaneously (e.g., when some hot events are occurring), the aggregated computing resources can dwarf any powerful server farm. Well, well, well, ...these are "conceptual level" thinking as of now. There are still many road-blocks to such a vision, even though we do see millions of machines working together in a P2P manner (e.g., streaming live video events). Again, as the old saying goes, the devils are in the details. Thinking of such gigantic scale of sharing computing resources is one thing, while implementing the idea is definitely another. Road-blocks to the grand vision of truly global P2P sharing include architectural maintenance problems arising from the sheer scale of the system, incentives for truthful cooperation, trust among peers when they need to accept data from remote sources, security issues caused by the inevitable existence of malicious users, etc"--

"It is apparent that file sharing on the Internet has become an emerging norm of media consumption especially among young people. This book provides a critical perspective on this phenomenon, exploring issues related to file sharing, downloading, peer-to-peer networks, "piracy," and (not least) policy issues regarding these practices. Andersson Schwartz critically engages with the justificatory discourses of the actual file-sharers, taking Sweden as a geographic focus. By focusing on the example of Sweden home to both The Pirate Bay and Spotify he provides a unique insight into a mentality that drives both innovation and deviance and accommodates sharing in both its unadulterated and its compliant, business-friendly forms"--
