Describing learner characteristics of handicapped children and youth
Peer support and social relationships have a tremendous influence on development, motivation, and achievement for all students, including struggling learners and those with disabilities. This highly practical book is one of the few resources available to guide classroom teachers and special educators in the application of peer-assisted instructional strategies in grades K-12. Expert contributors describe evidence-based approaches for building students' skills in reading, writing, math, and other content areas, as well as social competence and executive functioning. Sample lessons and more than a dozen reproducible tools are provided.

Special educational research in Finland
"Investigating the Language of Special Education guides the reader through the complex issues and ideas pertinent to understanding the language of special education. It responds to some of the subject's most pressing concerns, including the function and effects of language in labelling disabilities and disorders, the extent to which current special educational language reflects legal frameworks and definitions, and whether changes in language can lead to changes in perceiving a 'social reality' of special education. This volume brings clarity to these and other ambiguous areas in special education. Utilising a wide range of theoretical traditions from philosophy, sociology and anthropology, this book aims to raise the reader's awareness of the power as well as the limitations of language in relation to special education. It will therefore be of great interest to educators as well as students and researchers of applied linguistics and disability studies"--

Special education in Finland
Special education is now an established part of public education in the United States by law and by custom. However, it is still widely misunderstood and continues to be dogged by controversies related to such things as categorization, grouping, assessment, placement, funding, instruction, and a variety of legal issues. The purpose of this 13-part, 57-chapter handbook is to help profile and bring greater clarity to this sprawling and growing field. To ensure consistency across the volume, chapter authors review and integrate existing research, identifying strengths and weaknesses, note gaps in the literature, and discuss implications for practice and future research. This book is an appropriate reference volume for anyone (researchers, scholars, graduate students, practitioners, policy makers, and parents) interested in the state of special education today: its research base, current issues and practices, and future trends. It is also appropriate as a textbook for graduate level courses in special eduction.

Classroom assessment for students in special and general education
The field of special needs education is well established, and although it continues to develop in exciting and controversial ways, involving some of education's leading thinkers, many people feel it is lacking a coherent theoretical analysis of its own. Students and practitioners, looking for some solid theory to reinforce their own study or practice, commonly have to "borrow" from other disciplines, such as psychology and sociology, since there has been no attempt to provide a theoretical foundation for the special needs community. This book seeks to provide taht foundation and brings together contributions from key names in the field from the UK and beyond.
