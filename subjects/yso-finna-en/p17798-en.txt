The crustal and upper mantle structures of the Shield on the regional scale were investigated using the data of the POLENET/LAPNET passive seismic array and the previously published models of active and passive seismic experiments in the study area. This area is centred in northern Finland and it extends to surrounding areas in Sweden, Norway and northwestern Russia. The bedrock there is mostly of the Archaean origin and the lithosphere of the region was reworked by two orogenies during Palaeoproterozoic.One of the results of the thesis was a new map of the Moho depth of the study area, for which new estimates of the crustal thickness were obtained using receiver function method and complemented by published results of receiver function studies and controlled source seismic profiles. The map differs from the previously published maps in two locations, where we found significant deepening of the Moho. The 3D structure of the upper mantle was studied using teleseismic traveltime tomography method. The resulting model shows high seismic velocities below three cratonic units of the study area, which may correspond to non-reworked fragments of cratonic lithosphere and a low velocity anomaly separating these cratonic units from each other.The regional scale studies were complemented by two smaller scale studies in upper crust level using combined interpretation of seismic profiling and gravity data. These studies were centred on Archaean Kuhmo Greenstone Belt in eastern Finland and central Lapland in northern Finland located in the crust reworked during Palaeoproterozoic. Both areas are considered as prospective ones for mineral exploration. Both studies demonstrate the advantage of gravity data inversion in studying 3D density structure of geologically interesting formations, when the Bouguer anomaly data is combined with a priori information from petrophysical and seismi c datasets.

Advanced tomographic methods in materials research and engineering
X-ray computed tomography (CT) has experienced an explosion of technological development for a quarter century. Six years after the second edition of Computed Tomography, this third edition captures the most recent advances in technology and clinical applications. New to this edition are descriptions of iterative reconstruction, statistical reconstruction, methodologies used to model the CT systems, and the searching methodologies for optimal solutions. A new section on 3D printing introduces approaches by early adopters in the area. Also added is a description and discussion of the size-specific dose estimate, an index that attempts to more accurately reflect the dose absorption of specific-sized patients. The coverage of dual-energy CT has been significantly expanded to include its background, theoretical development, and clinical applications.

Performance and methodological aspects in positron emission tomography
Polymer nanocomposites are organic-inorganic hybrid materials where the inorganic filler has at least one dimension in the nanometer scale. They have properties that are far superior to those of not only the parent materials but also conventional microcomposites. These include optical, magnetic, thermal, energy-scavenging, biosensing, gas/water barrier, antimicrobial, and biodegradability properties. Two factors are responsible for these superior properties: the interface between polymer and matrix and the confinement of polymer matrix chains at the nanolevel.
