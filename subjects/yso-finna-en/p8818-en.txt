" For a phenomenon that is less than 10 years old, neuromarketing is now recognized as an important trend in the development of marketing techniques and applications. Providing a focused and in-depth examination of marketing research that studies consumers' sensorimotor, cognitive and affective responses to marketing stimuli, Neuromarketing in Action shows both the scientific frameworks and the practical applications of this increasingly popular marketing tool. The authors showcase the latest thinking on brain function and intelligence, and the subconscious influences on consumer behavior, referencing global brands such as Chanel, Lacoste, Amazon and Nike. In addition, they examine the ways in which marketing efficiency can be improved through the satisfaction of the customer's senses, emotions, memory and conscience - both in terms of current marketing activity (selling methods, sensory marketing, product modification) and potential future developments (value innovation, sensory brands, increased interaction with social networks and permission marketing)"--

Evidence is mounting that we are not as in control of our judgements and behavior as we think we are. Unconscious or 'automatic' forms of psychological and behavioral processes are those of which we tend to be unaware, that occur without our intention or consent, yet influence us on a daily basis in profound ways. Automatic processes influence our likes and dislikes for almost everything, as well as how we perceive other people, such as when we make stereotypic assumptions about someone based on their race or gender or social class. Even more strikingly, the latest research is showing that the aspects of life that are the richest experience and most important to us - such as emotions and our close relationships, as well as the pursuit of our important life tasks and goals - also have substantial unconscious components. "Social Psychology and the Unconscious: The Automaticity of Higher Mental Processes" offers a state-of-the-art review of the evidence and theory supporting the existence and the significance of automatic processes in our daily lives, with chapters by the leading researchers in this field today, across a spectrum of psychological phenomena from emotions and motivations to social judgement and behavior. The volume provides an introduction and overview of these now central topics to graduate students and researchers in social psychology and a range of allied disciplines with an interest in human behavior and the unconscious, such as cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind, political science, and business.

"Providing a focused and in-depth examination of the field of marketing research that studies consumers' sensorimotor, cognitive and affective responses to marketing stimuli, Neuromarketing in Action is the first book to show both the scientific frameworks and the practical applications of this increasingly popular marketing tool. Through 18 chapters, referencing many global brands such as Aston Martin, Chanel, Lacoste, Amazon, Nike, Carrefour and Dunhill, the authors showcase the latest thinking on brain function and intelligence, and the subconscious influences on consumer behaviour. The book then examines the ways in which marketing efficiency can be improved through the satisfaction of the customer's senses, emotions, memory and conscience and looks at the impact on current marketing activities (selling methods, sensory marketing, product modification) and future strategies (value innovation, sensory brands, increased interaction with social networks and permission marketing). Neuromarketing in Action provides both a practical review of current thinking and a detailed review of future developments, showing how the latest marketing techniques can be validated and legitimized through the prism of the consumer brain"--

Inception
Leonard Mlodinow examines how the unconscious mind shapes our experience of the world, and how, for instance, we often misperceive everything from our relationships with family, friends and business associates, the reasons for our investment decisions, to our own past. Your preference in politicians, the amount of tip you give the waiter - all our judgments and perceptions - reflect the workings of our mind on two levels, the conscious, of which we are aware, and the unconscious, which is hidden from us. The latter has long been the subject of speculation, but over the past two decades scientific researchers have developed remarkable new tools for probing the hidden, or subliminal, workings of the mind. The result of this explosion of research is a new science of the unconscious, and a sea change in our understanding of how the mind affects the way we live. These discoveries have revealed that the way we experience life-our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment - is largely driven by the mind's subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed.
