Rehabilitation : A Post-critical Approach reexamines the philosophical foundations of rehabilitation, expanding the concept of movement beyond the physical body. Drawing from disability studies, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, cultural studies, and bioethics, this theoretically rigorous yet accessibly styled text: explores the limitations of biomedicine as the organizing framework of rehabilitation, evaluates new directions to diversify contemporary rehabilitation practice, establishes the parameters for a reconfigured ethics of rehabilitation. By embracing multiple ideas of movement―not only physical, but also social, emotional, and political―alternative approaches to rehabilitation are revealed.
