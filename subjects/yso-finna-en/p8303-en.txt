"The psychological impact of dealing with the stress of the daily management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be arduous and challenging. Yet this area is rarely discussed in medical settings despite the fact that the emotional context can undermine the person's ability to stay motivated in the essential self-care tasks that are vital for good health.Diabetes and Wellbeing presents a range of research-based psychological principles that have been demonstrated to positively impact emotional wellbeing. It covers a broad spectrum of diabetes care from managing the initial diagnosis, overcoming depression and diabetes 'burnout', dealing effectively with fears and anxiety, managing food and weight issues and eating disorders, coping with the impact of sexual difficulties, and communicating with healthcare professionals.Jen Nash effectively guides the reader through strategies for better management of the issues associated with living with diabetes, moving individuals towards greater physical and psychological wellbeing and - as a result - a healthier future. This innovative yet practical guide is invaluable for individuals living with diabetes, those supporting others with diabetes, and healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with diabetes"--

"Diabetes and Wellbeing is a practical guide for those newly-diagnosed with diabetes, for individuals who have been managing the challenges of diabetes for many years, and the professionals who help those who deal with the complications of diabetes. This volume presents proven techniques for improving emotional wellbeing and is the first to take an explicitly CBT approach to diabetes. Positive Diabetes addresses the need for this kind of information among individuals with diabetes and healthcare providers"--

The aim of this study is to find out patients compliance to the treatment and management of diabetes and the factors that influencing it. Background to this study was prior clinical placements, a placement in a Diabetes Clinic in Kenya and personal experiences with relatives affected by diabetes. These experiences motivated interest in doing this study especially as compliance was a big issue among these patients. Qualitative research design was used and it adopts a phenomenological approach. Data collection was done using a semi-structured interview and participant observation. Eight (n=8) participants attending diabetes clinic at a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya were interviewed during the research process. The data collected from the interview was analysed using content analysis where four major themes were identified. Theme themes were: awareness, motivation, socio-economic factors and coping strategies. They were discussed and compared to literature reviewed. The results of the study indicated that there were various factors that affected compliance/adherence to treatment management of diabetes. Diabetes patients have to deal with a chronic illness that weighs on their quality of life and compliance seems to be affected by aspects in their life they can or cannot control for instance the vast knowledge of diabetes, high costs of diabetes, stress of the illness among other factors. There is positive effect on adherence which is results from continuous education and by developing other coping strategies. Patients have a significant role in the management and treatment of their illness and therefore they need to be included in their own care as this motivates their adherence.
