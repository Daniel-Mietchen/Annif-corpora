The enterprise lacks the talent echelon of simulation technology application. The application of simulation technology maturity of most enterprises is still relatively low, the lack of simulation process specification, material database, but simulation technology independent application in various disciplines; from application and product simulation technology design and test department, also can only be simulation technology as a means of verification. The potential of China simulation software market is huge, but also need long-term cultivation. Aonesoft Company should keep their leading position in industry, development rapidly without loss of stability, continue to strive for best partner of ANSYS Asia Pacific area. Therefore Aonesoft Companys future will be thriving. The future of simulation software will be more intelligent and cross platform development. By strengthening the research and development of new simulation software and strengthen industry demand, through the pilot to promote the application of traditional simulation software upgrade. The environment and the industry structure of simulation software in the future will be more complete and solid also vivid.

The software product business is living a new era due to break-through innovations concerning application, workstation and server virtualization. This process has influenced on the whole branch and forced manufacturers, distributors and resellers to their licensing policies and earning logics. The ICT-cluster is in front of the new challenges, because of the shortened life cycle of the products and continuously moving economical aspects caused by the customers, which are not willing to pay according to same licensing principles as before. The software asset management is both the challenge and the answer for the customer organizations to get direct and indirect software licensing savings and better license management. The traditional licensing policy and management are the challenges for the customers and the changes mentioned above will make it more difficult than ever. The need of the overall understanding is to acquire dedicated persons or specialized service providers to plan and manage the software asset management processes to get the best possible features and benefits of the software asset management concept. The added-value of this thesis is to give a set of tools to understand the complex licensing policy and pay attention to the possibilities of the software asset management concept.

This sector is going through major changes, which resulted in the unbundling of products and services. As the services business grows, it becomes the main revenue generating item, and telecommunication companies become software and services companies. Telecommunications services are based on software based solutions, and software needs continuous care, namely software maintenance.    The scope of this thesis is software business, more closely it deals with software maintenance budget planning. The starting point of the study was the following: the software update revenue – earned by the sponsor company - needs to be split up between the different software maintenance programs in a more efficient way, hence improving the budget planning of these programs. The study has three objectives: overviewing the way software business is approached by the sponsor company, finding relevant parameters to help more accurate software maintenance program budgeting, and analyzing the relationship between software update sales and problem ticket reporting.    First, the study overviews the relevant literature of products, services and software maintenance. Then it overviews the sponsor company's approach to software business. After this, the methodology of the study is presented. This means the investigation software maintenance programs of the sponsor company in order to find relevant parameters for budgeting. It is achieved by collecting evidence from various sources. The rest of the thesis presents and summarizes the findings, discusses the quality of the report and gives recommendations for future research.    The results of the study are the following. First, the report presents a summary of the SW Business approach at the sponsor company, which can be used as a compact self-study material on the topic. Further results are the relevant parameters for software maintenance program budgeting, as follows: installed base information, product characteristics, new vs. mature technologies, low cost vs. high cost locations, and different cost structures of the ex-companies. The study also presents a general formula for SW Update cost calculation in a global organization. Taken into consideration these result help a better budget planning for software maintenance programs.
