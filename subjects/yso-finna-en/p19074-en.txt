The copper scroll : overview, text and translation
Under natural conditions, a field trial was introduced to explore influences of soil acidification on availabilities of Cu and Pb and their transferences in soil vertical profiles. Four different levels of simulated acid rain (SAR) were sprayed to the field to acidify the soils so as to observe behaviors of available Cu and Pb. Soil samples were collected from four soil layers: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-60 cm. Results indicated that SAR could effectively decrease soil pH of four layers. With the decline of soil pH, contents of available Cu and Pb increased generally and high SAR level resulted in greater increases. In terms of vertical distributions in soil profiles, soil available Cu rose with the depth, indicating a downward movement of Cu to deeper soil layers; while soil available Pb increased only in the layer of 20-30 cm, but decreased dramatically in the deep soil layer (30-60 cm). This suggested that the available Cu was easy to transfer and available Pb was relatively immobile, under the influences of soil acidification. The results also revealed, with the prolongation of soil acidification, contents of soil available Pb increased, whereas contents of soil available Cu decreased, which implied soil available Cu was inclined to be transferred out of soils into groundwater, posing a threat to groundwater system, and soil available Pb was easier to accumulate in soils and be taken up by plants, posing a threat to the food security.

Nordic Solar is an architecturally fully integrated unglazed solar thermal collector, manufactured by the company Aurubis Finland Oy. The collector consists of a patinated copper absorber with a hidden solar thermal energy system on the back. The purpose of this study was to propose cost effective solutions for the second generation of Nordic Solar products. The objective was to find and analyse different alternatives for improving the collector by reducing its costs and increasing its applications, without altering the efficiency, architectural integration or lifespan of the product.   The Nordic Solar product is evaluated through SWOT analysis, and its main comparable competitors are investigated. The European solar thermal market and current trends in solar integration are evaluated to determine the market potential of the product. Different collector structure designs and joining methods to attach the pipes to the absorbers are studied, and the possibilities of expanding the product applications are analysed. The study is supported with research methods, mechanical tests, manufactured samples, and observations from pilot plant and simulation models. Development proposals that improve the system have been made. Further development and pilot testing is required to validate them. Research and results are covered by a confidentiality agreement.

The aim of the study was to determine the influence of Cu-glycine chelate on the chemical composition of the liver and blood parameters of broiler chickens. A total of 250 one-day-old Ross 308 male chicks were allotted into 5 groups with 5 replicates of 10 birds each. Rearing of birds lasted 42 days. In the experiment Cu was added to the premix in the form of CuSO4 (16 mg, 8 mg Cu), and in the form of Cu glycine chelate (16 mg, 8 mg, 4 mg Cu). The parameters in the chickens' blood remained within the range of physiological norms when lower levels of the analyzed elements were added. Adding lower levels of Cu (8 or 4 mg·kg-1) in comparison with the recommended doses (16 mg·kg-1) for broilers, in the form of highly assimilable organic sources, did not reduce the content of minerals Cu, Fe, and Zn in the chickens' liver, but reduced the faecal Fe, Cu and Zn concentrations compared to CuSO4.
