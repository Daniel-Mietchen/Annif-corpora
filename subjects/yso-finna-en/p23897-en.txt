Cancer-associated fibroblasts in skin squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer : role of fibroblast-derived integrin a11 and collagen XV in carcinogenesis
"The integrin family is composed of 24 members and approximately ten years ago (2003) we published a book devoted to the nine I domain integrin subunits. In this second edition, I am pleased that most of the original authors have been able to contribute to the updated version. I domain containing integrins include collagen receptors and leukocyte receptors. In 2003 the knockout mouse phenotypes for all of the I domain integrins had not yet been published; they are now, and are summarized and discussed in this edition. Interestingly, a recent 10 integrin mutation in dogs has indicated that collagen-binding integrins in the musculoskeletal system might have much more severe phenotypes in larger animals/humans compared to the mild integrin phenotypes observed in collagen-binding integrin deficient mice. This finding is further discussed in the book. In the cancer field, the microenvironment is taking center stage, and here collagen receptors on fibroblasts are predicted to play important roles in paracrine signaling, in regulating tissue stiffness and matrix remodeling. New technologies, new mouse models in combination with analyses of I integrins in larger animals/humans are thus predicted to increase our knowledge about this group of receptors. With this in mind we look forward to another 10 years of research with I domain integrins." -- (Back Cover)

"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been recognized primarily as autocrine/paracrine factors that regulate embryonic development and organogenesis. However, recent studies have revealed that some FGFs function as endocrine factors and regulate various metabolic processes in adulthood. Such FGFs, collectively called endocrine FGFs, are comprised of three members (FGF15/19, FGF21, and FGF23: FGF15 is the mouse ortholog of human FGF19). These endocrine FGFs share a common structural feature that enables the endocrine mode of action at the expense of the affinity to FGF receptors. To restore the affinity to FGF receptors in their target organs, the endocrine FGFs have designated the Klotho family of transmembrane proteins as obligate co-receptors. By expressing Klothos in a tissue-specific manner, this unique co-receptor system also enables the endocrine FGFs to specify their target organs among many tissues that express FGF receptors" -- Provided by publisher.
