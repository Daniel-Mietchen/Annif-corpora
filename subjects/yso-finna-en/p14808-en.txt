Deaf Professionals and Designated Interpreters: A New Paradigm defines a new model that depends upon strong partnerships between the growing number of deaf experts and their interpreters. Editors Peter C. Hauser, Karen L. Finch, and Angela B. Hauser have called upon more than a score of widely respected researchers to discuss the new dynamics of interpreting for deaf professionals. Divided into two parts, this volume first delineates Designated Interpreting, in which interpreters team with deaf professionals to advance a shared point of view. Chapters in this section include the linguistics of the partnership (Look-Pause-Nod); the varying attitudes and behavior of deaf professionals and their interpreters; interaction in the work-related social setting to ensure equal participation; interpreting as affected by conversational style and gender factors; academic and educational interpreting for deaf academics; and adjusting company policies with professional interpreter guidelines. Part II, Deaf Professional and Designated Interpreter Partnerships, offers relevant examples of interpreting for deaf professionals in real estate, contemporary art, medicine, business administration, education, mental health, film-making, and information technology. These anecdotal chapters demonstrate the critical complexity of the relationships between professionals and interpreters, a revolutionary transformation that will be appreciated by interpreter preparation programs, instructors, interpreters, and their clients alike.
Signed language interpreting continues to evolve as a field of research. Stages of professionalization, opportunities for education and the availability of research vary tremendously among different parts of the world. Overall there is continuing hunger for empirically founded, theoretically sound accounts of signed language interpreting to inform practice, pedagogy and the development of the profession. This volume provides new insights into current aspects of preparation, practice and performance of signed language interpreting, drawing together contributions from three continents. Contributors single out specific aspects of relevance to the signed language interpreting profession. These include preparation of interpreters through training, crucial for the development of the profession, with emphasis on sound educational programmes that cover the needs of service users and the wide-ranging skills expected from practitioners. Resources, such as terminology databases, are vital tools for interpreters to prepare successfully for events. Practice oriented, empirical investigations of strategies of interpreters are paramount not only to increase theoretical understanding of interpreter performance, but to provide reference points for practitioners and students. Alongside tackling linguistic and pragmatic challenges, interpreters also face the challenge of dealing with broader issues, such as handling occupational stress, an aspect which has so far received little attention in the field. At the same time, fine-grained assessment mechanisms ensure the sustainability of quality of performance. These and other issues are covered by the eighteen contributors to this volume, ensuring that the collection will be essential reading for academics, students and practitioners.
Reflecting the recent and revolutionary changes in policy and practises affecting deaf people, this book is a resource that serves deaf people, nondeaf people, interpreters, educators, and the general public. Examine the past and present models of interpreting by taking a journey from the early days of interpreting to today's professionalization of interpreters. The goal of this book is to further the understanding of all stakeholders - to provide a basis from which you can determine your interests and needs in this area - and to help improve the quality of the interpreting process.

This book is intended for people working primarily from ASL to English. It identifies skills required to render ASL to English interpretations using the same research method as the first book. These two pieces of research complement each other and should be used together. In both books, the term ASL is used in its broadest sense meaning that Deaf/deaf signers may use a wide range of language from ASL native signing to a more English-based signing. This entire range of signing was included in the research. No restrictions were placed on the degree of ASL fluency.

So you want to be an interpreter? : an introduction to sign language interpreting
The Sign Language interpreter provides the service of transmitting language between deaf and hearing people in everyday living situations. For example, the college classroom, a job interview, religious services, a visit to the doctor's office, a courtroom hearing, an evening at the theater, or even specialized television broadcasts. This important book appeared at a time when Sign Language interpreting is becoming the fastest growing profession within the field of deafness. It discusses relevant topics such as the interpreters role, specialized skills, ethics, various sign systems, situation assessment, and the certification procedure. In short, book is an invaluable text for students and teachers of interpreting, professionals and administrators of support services, and for anyone interested in integrating deaf and hearing individuals in any situation.

Deaf interpreters at work : international insights
This report presents the findings on the number and distribution of BSL/English interpreters and interpreter agencies in England, Scotland and Wales using survey data collected during 1999. It describes the qualifications and skills of BSL/English interpreters and the organisation of the service provided by interpreters and interpreter agencies. In addition to a survey of interpreters and interpreting agencies, the researchers conducted interviews and held public meetings with deaf people and hearing organisations that used BSL/English interpreting services to examine their demand for BSL/English interpreting services and their experience of the service provided. It is estimated that there are between 28,000 and 70,000 deaf people who use BSL as their first or preferred language. This report does not address other sign languages or other means of communication used by deaf or hearing impaired people.

Interpreting: the art of cross cultural mediation : Proceedings of the Ninth National Convention of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf July 4 - 8, 1985
The thought processes of Deaf interpreters served as the research focus for this study. This longitudinal qualitative study was designed to assess the thought processes, using a three-phase research approach--a preliminary interview, Think Aloud Protocol, and a retro-debriefing interview to explore the strategies and recourses for effective interpretation. The Think Aloud Protocol was conducted with a given task in which the participants had to think aloud as they worked through the task. The preliminary interview gathered background information and experiences as interpreters and the retro-debriefing interview served a technique of collecting further thoughts after the Think Aloud Protocol activity and as a closure for the three-phase procedure. The entire study was videotaped and then translated from American Sign Language to English. A triangulation of the study explored the depths of the thought processes of six Deaf participants during the three-phase activity. Findings indicated results on best practices for strategies and resources for effective interpretation by Deaf interpreters.

"This ground-breaking work, originally published 15 years ago, continues to serve as the primary reference on the theories of omission potential and translational contact in sign language interpreting. In the book, noted scholar Jemina Napier explores the linguistic coping strategies of interpreters by drawing on her own study of the interpretation of a university lecture from English into Australian Sign Language (Auslan). A new preface by the author provides perspective on the importance of the work and how it fits within the scholarship of interpretation studies. The concept of strategic omissions is explored here as a tool that is consciously used by interpreters as a coping strategy. Instead of being a mistake, omitting part of the source language can actually be part of an active decision-making process that allows the interpreter to convey the correct meaning when faced with challenges. For the first time, Napier found that omission potential existed within every interpretation and, furthermore, she proposed a new taxonomy of five different conscious and unconscious omission types. Her findings also indicate that Auslan/English interpreters use both a free and literal interpretation approach, but that those who use a free approach occasionally switch to a literal approach as a linguistic coping strategy to provide access to English terminology. Both coping strategies help negotiate the demands of interpretation, whether it be lack of subject-matter expertise, dealing with dense material, or the context of the situation. Napier also analyzes the interpreters’ reflections on their decision-making processes as well as the university students’ perceptions and preferences of their interpreters’ linguistic choices and styles. Linguistic Coping Strategies in Sign Language Interpreting is a foundational text in interpretation studies that can be applied to interpreting in different contexts and to interpreter training."

Sign language interpreters and interpreting
Signed language interpreting is about access, states author Jeremy L. Brunson at the outset of his new book, and no manifestation of access for deaf people can be considered more complex than video relay services (VRS). In Video Relay Service Interpreters: Intricacies of Sign Language Access, Brunson delineates exactly how complicated the service can be, first by analyzing sign language interpreting as a profession and its relation to both hearing and deaf clients. He describes how sign language interpreters function in Deaf communities and how regulatory processes imposed by VRS providers can constrain communication access based on each individuals needs. Brunson proceeds by acclimating readers to the environment of VRS and how the layout of the typical physical plant alters the practice of interpreting. The focus then falls upon intended VRS users, providing insights into their expectations. Interpreters shared their experiences with Brunson in 21 formal interviews and discussions. Many remarked on the differences between face-to-face interpreting and VRS training, which often runs counter to the concept of relating informally with deaf clients as a way to expand access. This thoughtful, sociological study outlines texts that originate between users and interpreters and how they can be used to develop VRS access. Video Relay Service Interpreters concludes with the implications of VRS interpreting for sign language interpreting in general and suggests where scholarship will lead in the future.
This revision of the book incorporates the many changes that have occurred in the field since the publication of the original text in 1981. It reflects the shifts in philosophy and current trends in interpreting. Like the first text, this revision is down to earth and unpretentious while respectful of the field and complexity of the task. Revised edition remains an invaluable text for students and teachers of interpreting, professionals and administrators of support services, and for anyone interested in integrating D/deaf and hearing individuals in any given situation.
