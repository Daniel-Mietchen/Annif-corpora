"As the digital landscape has changed buyers' habits it's increasingly difficult to reach them early enough in their decision-making process using traditional sales methods. Developing relationships with decision-makers through social networks has become an increasingly critical skill - enabling sales professionals to engage early on and 'hack' the buying process. Social Selling provides a practical, step-by-step blueprint for harnessing these specific and proven techniques including: - How to use networks purposefully to build social trust and create a high quality community - How to develop real influence and authority in your subject area and connect with change-makers - How to scale the social selling strategy across an organisation including maturity and investment models, risk and governance, and technology platforms"--

"In WE-Commerce, visionary marketing strategist Billee Howard lays out her plan for a new vision of success and long-term, purposeful profitability in the new global, sharing economy Today, the most successful businesses and entrepreneurs thrive through connectivity, socialization, and sharing. It is an age of WE-Commerce, an economy centered on the power of "we" instead of "me," focused on the needs of the many over the few. Booming companies such as UÌˆber and Airbnb leverage technology to create platforms that rely largely on social media and community feedback to facilitate people's ability to collaborate with one another. Instead of traditional business strategies, companies must now inspire belief and trust in their communities; collaborate with their customers; create business models that are socially and environmentally responsible; find opportunities for creative collaboration with large, global markets; and become a new generation of innovators--"artists of business." With advice from "stay small but include all" to "profit with purpose" and "embrace disruption," Billee Howard gives readers the reinvented business toolkit that they will need to effectively collaborate, co-create, and succeed in a WE-Commerce landscape, and to acquire a new set of skills that will position them as leaders in the transformed economy"--

The primary objective of the thesis was to find out how the foreign representatives of Tamtron Group evaluate the cooperation between them and Tamtron Group. The study was conducted from the foreign representatives' point of view. The meaning was to identify how the foreign representatives experience the cooperation. The intention was to gather information for Tamtron Group to help it to improve these relationships. The study was conducted by using quantitative methods. The data was collected by using a self-completion questionnaire which was sent by email. The questionnaire contained both multiple choice questions and open questions. The sample of the research included all the foreign representatives of Tamtron Group. The questions handled the overall assessment of the relationship, positive aspects in the relationship, challenges facing the representatives and development ideas of the representatives. All the foreign representatives were categorized according to how long relationship they had with Tamtron Group. The categorization was made in order to see whether there were differences in the answers between the different groups. The study shows that the foreign representatives are in general satisfied with the cooperation. The overall satisfaction of all the representatives was basically at the same level, not depending on the length of the relationship they had with Tamtron Group. The most positive aspect in the relationship seemed to be the personal relations. The price reasoning and lack of technical competence formed the biggest challenges for the representatives. The issues for development seem to be technical and commercial training and more marketing material in representative's own language. The answers of the respondents to questions concerning challenges facing the representatives and development ideas varied to some extent according to the length of relationship. Lack of technical competence seemed to be bigger problem for representatives who had only few years' relationship with Tamtron Group than for representatives with longer experience. This means that Tamtron Group should focus on different issues on different phases of the relationship in order to improve the cooperation.

This bachelor's thesis is a study into the implications that social media have on business-to-business marketing communications and customer relationship development. It starts off from the observation that traditional marketing and communications are currently facing a transitional phase, as the new paradigm for relationship marketing in electronic media has introduced a competitive model for interactive and collaborative communication. In that regard, the thesis frames the research questions by integrating theory from the relationship marketing perspective of value-driven buyer-seller relationships with social media marketing communication aspects. Although there is still a shortage of academic research and proven practice on the research topic, this study aims to showcase current efforts to generate knowledge on relationship marketing communication in social media, with a particular emphasis on business-to-business markets. The central goal of this thesis is to provide the case company, Dimedia Oy, with a model that integrates the development of marketing relationships with marketing communication practice in social media, and thus encourages it into entering the social media space. The contribution solves the problem by showing that the characteristics of social media add another layer to marketing communications, which needs to be treated differently compared to traditional marketing efforts. In addition, the study suggests that by building a roadmap for social media engagement, organizations can create a social media marketing communications strategy that matches their current expertise, comfort level, and available resources. Successful implementation of this strategy can increase the quality and frequency of interaction with customers, and build relationships with prospects much earlier in the purchasing cycle as well as in all of the phases of relationship development. The analysis leading to this contribution is done in three steps over the course of three chapters. The first of these steps consist providing a theoretical background by covering the basics, strategy, and the business-to-business side of relationship marketing, marketing communications, and social media. The second step offers a more practical perspective to the study by combining important aspects of theory with practice in relation to the role of social media in business-to-business marketing communications and customer relationship development. To counter the current trends described in the first and second parts, the third step of the thesis develops a possible approach by providing the case company with a practical social media policy document as well as elements and recommended procedures for creating and enforcing social media policies and strategies for its customers.
As we move deeper into the 21st century, firms continue to struggle with the implementation of sales force technology tools and the role they play in sales representative performance. Foreseeing a changing environment, many sales organizations have begun to focus on technology-related strategies, business processes, and applications to adapt to these emerging issues. With this in mind, sales force technology usage has changed the methods of selling. Salespeople are no longer selling just a "product"; instead, they are providing a valuable "solution" to customer problems. Salespeople now act as consultants or experts and provide customized solutions. This role requires salespeople to develop a technological orientation to access, analyze, and communicate information in order to establish a strong relationship with customers. Sales technology enables salespeople to answer the queries of customers and effectively provide competent solutions. The ability to answer queries and provide solutions leads to strong relationships between a salesperson and a customer. Thus, technology tools are not only used for smoothing the work process, but they also have strategic utilizations. With the adoption of technological tools at exponential rates, many firms fell into pitfalls and witnessed failure of their technology initiatives. The purpose of this book is to outline the important steps that must be considered and adhered to when implementing sales force technology. Perhaps the most important aspect covered within this book is that technology usage is both a strategy and a tool; therefore, we outline both strategic considerations as well as implementation procedures throughout each chapter. It is important to consider all the steps and the necessary actions that will need to take place before the first penny is spent; then, and only then, will the technology have its intended effect.

"It is easy for today's leaders to fall into the trap of the trendy technology associated with these initiatives--of designing "cool" systems that generate superficial results. But it is not the technology that makes these three initiatives so important, so promising and so misunderstood. It's that they have changed the way consumers behave, and it's only when these changes are understood and responded to from a business perspective that the potential of the BIG-SOCIAL-MOBILE enterprise can be realized. The premise of BIG-SOCIAL-MOBILE is that these three major business trends have the potential to improve enterprise performance significantly but only if they're implemented in a holistic fashion; and only if they're implemented to enhance and support what has traditionally made a business unique rather than to reinvent the company. The book offers an integrative process that has helped a wide range of companies connect these initiatives to each other and to their enterprise strategy, and one that has yielded transformative results--creating a truly BIG-SOCIAL-MOBILE enterprise"--

Successful exchange relationships between organizations and their various partners in those exchanges - suppliers, customers, employees, or a wide variety of other types of exchange partners - have become critical to the overall success of organizations in an economy that is increasingly global, hypercompetitive, and evolutionary. This Handbook highlights relationship marketing as an area of growing interest and ongoing development within marketing, providing key insights that illustrate its important role in guiding customer-directed business strategies. Relationship marketing is an approach to increase long-term profitability through loyal customers. With increased customer retention, fewer resources need to be invested in acquiring new customers and marketing costs go down. The Handbook on Relationship Marketing brings together contributions from some of the leading figures in the field to analyze the role of marketing with suppliers and customers, as well as internal and lateral partners. The Handbook will appeal to scholars and students of marketing and business. It will also be a useful resource for practitioners looking to exploit relationship marketing for better customer retention.

With the ever increasing online community and opportunities, digital marketing is fast becoming the mainstream in the field of marketing. At the same time marketers have to be up-to-date with the current digital trends in order to be able to improve themselves and make valuable contributions to their organisations. The significance of digital marketing thus should make any thoughtful organisation want to plan for, perform, evaluate and improve its digital marketing endeavours where necessary, in order to take advantage of the opportunities available. This importance therefore necessitated this research. This thesis was commissioned by Koodiviidakko Oy, a Finnish company producing digital marketing software. The focus of this research is on business to business digital marketing in a digitally emerging market, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the case study. A broad literature review of the concept of business to business (B2B) was performed, touching on aspects such as organisational buying behaviour, decision making unit and relationship marketing. Also discussed was B2B marketing communications from two dimensions; channel and relationship. Furthermore, the report examined the concepts of content marketing, digital marketing and digital marketing channels which are important concepts relevant to the thesis subject matter. The research was both qualitative and quantitative with analytical tools used to gather statistical data on the commissioner's digital marketing channels. The results gathered from the research showed that the commissioner's digital marketing efforts in the UAE are on the right track but more needs to be done especially in the areas of customer acquisition, customer conversion and measuring return on investments. Finally, based on the findings, recommendations were made, that the commissioner could employ in order to improve its digital marketing.

Abstract: Analysis of Attitudes towards Mobile Direct Marketing Directed to Consumers Involved in Loyalty Programs. The main objective of this dissertation was to analyze general attitudes consumers have towards mobile direct marketing, when it is executed by some company whose loyalty program they are involved in. The study was then investigating the level of interest towards such advertising. The research was based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative research, and an online survey of 94 individuals from different age groups and professions was conducted for data collection purposes. The research aimed at giving generalized view of the consumers' reaction to the topic and suggestions on how this information could be used by any company planning on incorporating mobile direct marketing to their loyalty programs. A critical review of relevant secondary data was carried out to get insight on consumer behavior, when it comes to loyalty programs and mobile direct marketing. The literature review discusses in general terms of the topic related concepts of marketing and consumer behavior, and finishes with introducing the different uses and types of mobile direct marketing. This information gave the basis for primary research. Results of the research placed some of the theory of secondary data under consideration, and further recommendation for research would therefore be focusing on viral activity related to loyalty program messages as well as realization of paid-for ordering service. Limitations of research include the absence of a commissioner, which affects the reliability of the primary research results.

The objective of this study is to demonstrate that there is a connection between increased customer satisfaction and usage intensity with service improvement in the B2B environment. Laattapiste Oy was used as a case company to demonstrate this connection.      The theoretical framework was based on theories proposed by authors Parasuraman A, Zeithaml V. and Berry L. â€“ A conceptual Model of Service Quality as well as GrÃ¶nroos C. author of Service Management and Marketing- A Relationship Management Approach. The theory presented concept of service quality, customer relationship and servicescape.     The study was carried in form of face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The data was gathered in January 2011 by conducting five face-to-face interviews with the help of a pre-formulated questionnaire. Each interview lasted for approximately one hour. The analytical approach was qualitative, as it was the best approach suited for examining the topic. The sample was a group of professional architect and designer customers of Laattapiste Oy.     The findings revealed that the customers were mainly satisfied with the service at Laattapiste Oy, however getting contact with the salespeople was found somewhat difficult as well as keeping promises on deliveries â€“ specifically samples. The study focused more on functional quality rather than on technical quality. The findings also revealed that the servicescape, the Bathroom Studio Showroom was considered good, but the premises were considered slightly boring, more products and technical information was wanted for display. Respondents were also interested in short lectures on products. The findings also revealed that customers found the social, financial and geographical bonds important. Problems with the deliveries and responsiveness were identified.     In conclusion, the research questions posed in the beginning were answered. The study showed that in order to increase customer satisfaction the company needs to constantly keep in touch with its customers, not only focus on acquiring new customers but fostering good relationships with current key customers. The service quality must be assessed and improved. The servicescape was also considered as a tool for customer retention and its improvement meaning better service for customers.
