This market research was conducted on a request of the logistics software specialist Soloplan GmbH to discover business opportunities in the Finnish Transport Management System (TMS) producer market. The basis for the research lies in numerous theories which suggest certain key factors to be examined to better predict success or failure for a company in a target market. These essential factors were said to be the macro environment, the market size and trend, the competitive setting on the market and most importantly the features of the customers. The goal was to acquire enough information about all of these to be able to analyze whether it could be recommended for Soloplan GmbH to establish business operations in Finland. The research proved Finland being attractive due to its supportive macro environment, the high importance of transportations sector to the country in general and the large number of potential customers i.e. the road haulage companies. A survey was conducted to estimate the demand and to learn more about the potential customers. The results showed that the usage of TMS is not widespread, but the interest in it exists. However, the survey also indicated that the target market is segmented and dominated by smaller transporters with less need for such management tool and high price-sensitivity. Also the competition in the market was found to be quite intensive. It was concluded that successful market entry for Soloplan GmbH would require product customization for the local needs and it is not recommended alone for the small Finnish market.

What impact has globalisation had on transport? And what have been the consequences for the environment? This book aims to answer these questions and more. It looks in detail at how globalisation has affected activity levels in maritime shipping, aviation, and road and rail freight, and assesses the impact that changes in activity levels have had on the environment. The book also discusses policy instruments that can be used to address negative environmental impacts, both from an economic perspective and from the point of view of international law.
