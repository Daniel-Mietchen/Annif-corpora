This study evaluates potential factors determining match wins in tennis Grand Slam men's singles. Previous studies used true experimental designs, quasi-experimental designs and questionnaire surveys with small sample sizes to capture the conditions in the events. However, they generally fall short of producing a comprehensive answer to the key research question. The authors use a large-scale sample of 9144 matches (including 845 players) in tennis men's singles Grand Slam tournaments from 1991 to 2008, retrieved from the official open-access website of the Association of Tennis Professionals.

Bringing together the current knowledge and evidence about the causes and management of tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, the diagnosis and various treatment options for this common sports injury are presented in detail. Generally attributed to overexertion or repetitive motion of the elbow joint, tennis elbow causes pain, tenderness and stiffness in the elbow and wrist even in non-athletic, day-to-day activities, such as lifting and pulling. Beginning with its etiology, subsequent chapters explore both conservative and surgical treatments, from physical therapy, joint injections and acupuncture to arthroscopy, open surgery and denervation. Outcomes, rehabilitation and return to play are also discussed, as are techniques and indications for handling complications and revision surgery. Ideal for orthopedic surgeons and sports medicine practitioners, Tennis Elbow: Clinical Management is a practical reference for any clinician treating athletes or active patients.
