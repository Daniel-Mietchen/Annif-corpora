"Jeremy Salt offers the background essential for understanding the Middle East today by chronicling the long and bloody history of Western intervention in Arab lands. He examines the major events that have shaped the region - ranging from the French in Algeria and the British in Egypt in the nineteenth century to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and to the continuing war in Iraq. Making use of extensive research in U.S. and British archives to reveal what politicians were deciding behind closed doors, and why, this book will change the way we see the Middle East."--BOOK JACKET.

Environmental protection and the law of war : a 'Fifth Geneva' convention on the protection of the environment in time of armed conflict
Summary: The strategic decision making process inside Bush government was informal, influenced by strong personalities and sometimes strict disputes. These qualities were combined with heavy neo-conservative thinking and, above all, the shock effect of 9/11 terrorist attacks. These attacks gave the justification for Commander-in-Chief leadership style. Decisions were made as fast and effectively as possible and they were followed through  even if they were controversial in nature.
