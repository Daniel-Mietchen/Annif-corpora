"As the search for alternative energy technologies heats up, no topic is hotter than fuel cells. Updating its successful first edition, Fuel Cell Fundamentals, Second Edition gives advanced undergraduate and beginning level graduate students an important introduction to the basic science and engineering behind fuel cell technology. Emphasizing the foundational scientific principles that apply to any fuel cell type or technology, the text provides straightforward descriptions of how fuel cells work, why they offer the potential for high efficiency, and how their unique advantages can best be used."--Jacket.
