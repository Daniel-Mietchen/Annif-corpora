Ruby, Blue and Blanket
This is a collection of new writing on the way in which objects in everyday life are made socially acceptable and "appropriate" for women and men. What does the Strawberry Shortcake doll tell us about views of the adult female body? When does the necktie become anti-establishment? How does a woman relate to a washing-machine? And can a hearing aid really be gendered? This book attempts to answer these questions and raise others about genderization in the design of everyday objects.
