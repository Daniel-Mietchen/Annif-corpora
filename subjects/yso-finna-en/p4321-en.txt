Essays on the effects of gains and losses on the trading behavior of individual investors in the Finnish stock market
The objective of the study was to gather information of China's real estate market and local consumer's buying behaviour linked with residential properties in Nanjing. The purpose is to help foreign investors to develop a better understanding of Chinese consumer and its real estate market. The findings will answer the research questions: what is the investment climate of China's real estate market like? And what are the characteristics of consumer's behaviour on purchasing residential properties in Nanjing, China? The theoretical framework is based on the combination of three theories which are PESTE, Five Forces Industry Analysis and Consumer's Buying Behaviour. PESTE analysis gives a general picture of investment climate related to real estate in China. Five forces industry analysis presents close and detailed information of the China's real estate industry. And Consumer's buying behaviour model focuses on the buying decision-making process of consumers, especially the criteria and factors that influence it. The research methodology used was mainly quantitative, primary data was collected by qualitative interviews and a questionnaire. 80 questionnaires were collected and analysed. Secondary data was mainly collected from books, internet web pages and research reports.     The findings show that China's investment climate is positive and China's real estate market has a great potential for development. Price, type, structure, design, location of housing are the main influences on potential buyer's decision making process. Foreign investors need to have suitable marketing strategy based on good knowledge of the current industry situation and major factors which can give great influences on consumer's buying behaviour, in order to cater to targeted buyer's needs and desires for residential properties.  The study suggests foreign investors to 'touch the stone while crossing rive'. It is important for foreign investors to know the trend of the market and understand Chinese consumers' needs and desires for their future residential properties. Investors need to bear in mind to build up and keep a good relationship with suppliers and Chinese authorities within the real estate industry. In addition, in order to enhance investors' competitiveness in terms of penetrating China's real estate market, to establish a good reputation and to have a continuously close monitoring action on the major player's performance are key issues.

"As today's preeminent doomsday investor Mark Spitznagel describes his Daoist and roundabout investment approach, "one gains by losing and loses by gaining." This is Austrian Investing, an archetypal, counterintuitive, and proven approach, gleaned from the 150-year-old Austrian School of economics, that is both timeless and exceedingly timely. In The Dao of capital, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel--with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career--takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring. Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and--as Spitznagel has shown--highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel "brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio. "The Dao of capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process--a harmony that is so essential today"--

As incredible as it may seem in this hyper-connected, technologically advanced era, half the planet’s population exist as "Financial nomads"—those who nourish and shelter themselves without using traditional banking services. While the wealthy live at the top of a metaphorical pyramid, taking financial security and banking services for granted, there are billions of people who struggle at the pyramid's base in an exhausting state of financial exclusion and insecurity. Times are changing rapidly, but despite global uncertainty, technology has the capacity to reach and equip people in all walks of life. Advances in communications have reconfigured the ease with which we interact with our money—and these advances can provide innovative financial services to the unbanked and underserved around the world. Financial inclusion for all is indeed within our reach, and with this conviction, authors Karl Mehta and Carol Realini propose a vision for a better world and a blueprint to get there.

"Over the past three years, the notorious @GSElevator Twitter feed has offered a hilarious, shamelessly voyeuristic look into the real world of international finance. Hundreds of thousands followed the account, Goldman Sachs launched an internal investigation, and when the true identity of the man behind it all was revealed, it created a national media sensation--but that's only part of the story.  Where @GSElevator captured the essence of the banking elite with curated jokes and submissions overheard by readers, Straight to hell adds John LeFevre's own story--an unapologetic and darkly funny account of a career as a globe-conquering investment banker spanning New York, London, and Hong Kong."--Amazon.com.

The classic text has been annotated to update Graham's timeless wisdom for today's market conditions.
This book traces the evolution of connoisseurship in the booming Dutch art market of the seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries. The question whether or not seventeenth-century painters such as Rembrandt and Rubens created the paintings which were later sold under their names, has caused many a heated debate. Much is still unknown about the ways in which paintings were produced, assessed, priced, and marketed. Who was credited with the ability to assess paintings? How did a painting's price relate to its quality? And how did connoisseurship change as the art market became increasingly complex? This groundbreaking study includes insightful essays by, among others, Eric Jan Sluijter, Hans Van Miegroet and Neil De Marchi. It is not to be missed by anyone with an interest in the Old Masters and the early modern art market.
