Novel immunological markers of Lyme borreliosis
This book showcases advanced empirical research that applies the concept of organizational routines to understanding organizations and how they change and evolve. Specific issues highlighted include the use of event-sequence methods in the analysis of organizational routines, the impact of standard operating procedures on recurrent behavior patterns, and the stability, resilience, and change of organizational routines. The book thus provides an overview of different empirical methods applied to study organizational routines, and of their prerequisites, analytical power, and contribution.
