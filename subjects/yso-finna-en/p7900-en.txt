Conservative care, total contact casts and footwear are discussed, as well as the management of infections and osteomyelitis. Acute fractures and Charcot arthropathy for the forefoot, midfoot and ankle follow, including plate and axial fixation techniques, with authors' preferred treatment strategies presented in step-by-step fashion. Written and edited by recognized leaders in the field, this is a must-have for orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists treating diabetic patients and will be an excellent resource for treating these debilitating afflictions.
