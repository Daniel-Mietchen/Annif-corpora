Human rights education : reflections on theory and practice
The law relating to parent and child in Scotland
This major new study focuses on human rights education in theory and practice. It has three main themes that are inter-related and developed over a range of national and international contexts. The first theme addresses the role of human rights teaching in citizenship education and in education for sustainable development. The second theme focuses on the rights of children in education and the concept of 'voice'. The third theme locates human rights education in curriculum design and classroom practice. This book, which brings together a range of papers originally presented at a conference hosted by the Centre for Human Rights and Citizenship Education in St. Patrick's College in Dublin, makes an important contribution to the current thinking and best practice in human rights education. Contributors include Fionnuala Waldron, Hugh Starkey, James A. Banks, Peter Kirschlaeger, Anita Prunty, Paula Murphy, Susan Pike, Brian Ruane, Colum Kenny and Fintan McCutcheon.

The law relating to children
"In the years since the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) childrens rights have assumed a central position in a wide variety of disciplines and policies. This handbook offers an engaging overview of the contemporary research landscape for those people engaged in the theory and practice of childrens rights. The volume consists of two parts with the first providing an insight into interdisciplinary approaches to childrens rights, with contributions from history, childhood studies, sociology, social work and educational sciences, law, anthropology, and gender studies. The second part considers key issues in childrens rights situating them at the intersection of the global and the local. This combination of disciplinary approaches and thematic analysis allows the reader to gain a deep understanding of childrens rights. The handbook takes a critical approach to the topic, questioning and analysing assumptions underlying childrens rights practices. The specially commissioned chapters have been written by renowned scholars and researchers working in the field and come together to provide an invaluable guide to the challenges and dilemmas currently facing childrens rights"--

Sociologies of childhood and educational thinking
There is urgent need for adults to re-think their ideas about childhood. Sociological approaches to childhood are needed as key contributions to improve basic conceptual thinking about how society works; as a matter of social justice; and as theoretical bases for educational reforms. Children have been traditionally understood in the education system as immature, incompetent, morally suspect pupils. Sociological thinking can help reconceptualise them as people to be respected; as knowledgeable, critical, competent participants in learning. Universities have an important role in providing opportunities for studients to study sociological approaches to childhood.

Children : rights and childhood
This edited volume discusses UNESCO's contributions to inclusive education over the past 20 years, the normative and technical leadership roles this organization has been playing together with its peers and competitors in educational development, and the current status of this issue in academic debates, as well as conceptualizations from different cultures. The chapters reflect and critically discuss a range of positions on the relation between inclusive education, education for all, and special needs education and particularly express the role disability plays in these thematic contexts. The book brings to light that although the term inclusive education is commonly associated with people with disabilities, there are contexts - e.g., research strands on school development in the UK - in which inclusive education is considered as an approach in which the focus of special (needs) education is widened in terms of the target group, reaching out to the heterogeneity of learners, thus taking diversity as a starting point for educational theory and practice. This book highlights the differences in narratives of inclusive education in the United States and abroad and is intended to bridge the various approaches to the study of inclusive education and disability, particularly in the US, the UK, and the Nordic countries within Europe. Although academics and students in Disability Studies are the target audience, the book is also of high relevance to policy makers in the growing field of inclusive education, as well as being potentially interesting for practitioners in education and social work.

This volume explores the political geographies of children and young people and aims to cement this research area within human geography and beyond. Indeed, the policies that specifically target young individuals and groups, and the politics in the everyday lives of children and youth across all scalar dimensions deserve broad attention. The book is structured in four sections with specific focus on the spatialities of the rights of the child, children and young peopleâ€™s agency in politics, youthful practice as political resistance, and active youth citizenship. In the 28 chapters, a total of 43 authors based in 14 different countries explicate how issues of youthful citizenship, childrenâ€™s rights, and children and young people's political agencies cross disciplinary, methodological and theoretical boundaries, with notable geographical variation. Particular attention falls on children and young peopleâ€™s active roles in different kinds of political situations, environments, processes, and practices. The volume also emphasises that there is scope for future research, not least because of the shifting (geo)political landscapes across the globe.
