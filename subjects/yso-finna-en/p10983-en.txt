ANTHROPOLOGY. We inherit mechanisms for survival from our primeval past; none so obviously as those involved in reproduction. The hormone testosterone underlies the organization of activation of masculinity: it changes the body and brain to make a male. It is involved not only in sexuality but in driving aggression, competitiveness, risk-taking - all elements that were needed for successful survival and reproduction in the past. But these ancient systems are carried forward into a modern world. The ancient world shaped the human brain, but the modern world is shaped by that brain. How does this world, with all its cultural, political, and social variations, deal with and control the primeval role of testosterone, which continues to be essential for the survival of the species? Sex, aggression, winning, losing, gangs, war: the powerful effects of testosterone are entwined with them all.

Summary.
The Steroids Game cuts through the hype and misinformation common in most books on anabolic steroids. One of the world's top steroid authorities, Charles Yesalis, teams up with Virginia Cowart to provide a straightforward and balanced discussion of what steroids are, how they work, their effects on athletic performance, their health consequences, and possible solutions to the growing problem.
