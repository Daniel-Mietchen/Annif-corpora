This book is written for researchers and students interested in the function and role of chemical elements in biological or environmental systems. Experts have long known that the Periodic System of Elements (PSE) provides only an inadequate chemical description of elements of biological, environmental or medicinal importance. This book explores the notion of a Biological System of the Elements (BSE) established on accurate and precise multi-element data, including evolutionary aspects, representative sampling procedures, inter-element relationships, the physiological function of elements and uptake mechanisms. The book further explores the concept Stoichiometric Network Analysis (SNA) to analyze the biological roles of chemical species. Also discussed is the idea of ecotoxicological identity cards which give a first-hand description of properties relevant for biological and toxicological features of a certain chemical element and its geo biochemically plausible speciation form. The focus of this book goes beyond both classical bioinorganic chemistry and toxicology.

Microplastic Pollutants introduces the reader to the growing problem of microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment and is the first ever book dedicated exclusively to the subject of microplastics. Importantly, this timely full-colour illustrated multidisciplinary book highlights the very recent realization that microplastics may transport toxic chemicals into food chains around the world. Microplastic pollutants is currently an important topic in both industry and academia, as well as among legislative bodies, and research in this area is gaining considerable attention from both the worldwide media and scientific community on a rapidly increasing scale. Ultimately, this book provides an excellent source of reference and information on microplastics for scientists, engineers, students, industry, policy makers and citizens alike.
"Biology of Freshwater Pollution is a highly regarded overview of the subject aimed at advanced undergraduates and professionals. This latest edition provides an up-to-date summary of the whole field covering recent research, case studies and examples. The book begins by describing contrasting examples of pollution events. Individual chapters then deal with the major types of pollution introducing their sources, exploring their impacts on biological systems and water resources using contemporary examples, and discussing methods for mitigating impacts. Techniques used to investigate pollution are introduced throughout and the penultimate chapter deals extensively with the biological assessment of water quality. The final chapter looks at water resource management in the twenty-first century and the role of the biologist in that process." "This book is aimed at advanced students in Aquatic and Applied Biology, Limnology and Environmental Science and scientists working in the water industry."
