"In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us that math isn't confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do--the whole world is shot through with it. Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It's a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does "public opinion" really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician's method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman--minus the jargon. Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. "--

From an early age, deaf children excel in thinking about and remembering what they learn through visual spatial instruction. This strength in information processing can be used in the mathematics classroom to achieve better learning outcomes.  This book discusses ways to teach deaf children about the four arithmetic operations through spatial representation in problem solving. Examples for the teaching of fractions and graphs are also included. These visual representations are useful to support the children's understanding of mathematical concepts and to promote peer collaboration.  The teaching programme was tested with deaf children in six schools with excellent results: the children in the project made significantly more progress in one school year than expected for either deaf and hearing children over the same time.
