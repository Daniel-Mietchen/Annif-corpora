Brown bear (Ursus arctos) population structure, demographic processes and variations in diet in northern Eurasia
Data on the Finnish bear, mainly from the period 1960 - 1971, were collected from various sources. Of the bears killed during the period 1960 - 1971, the sex of 536 was determined and the age of 666. The present range of the bear in Finland covers a narrow zone on the eastern frontier in North Karelia and Kainuu, and eastern and central parts of Lapland...
