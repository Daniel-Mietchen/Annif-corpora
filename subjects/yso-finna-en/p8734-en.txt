Phonetic imitation, accent, and the learner
This insightful volume explores the use of imitation and the modern cult of originality through a consideration of the disparate fates of two Venetian painters - the canonized master Titian (c. 1488-1576) and his artistic heir, the little known Padovanino (1588-1649). "Titian Remade" compares three of Padovanino's paintings - "Sleeping Venus" (1610), "Triumph" (1620), and "Self-Portrait" (ca. 1630) - with corresponding works by Titian, and argues that repetition is not simply the last resort of the uninspired, but can be a positive act of artistic self-definition.

"In this study of prehistoric innovation, the author argues that a range of technologies and practices need to be considered in order to place innovation into the pre-existing social and technological systems in which it functioned and to assess the means by which it was accepted and valued. In particular the study focuses on how archaeological interpretations of stone objects and stone-working can help understand the adoption and continued presence of metal and metallurgy in prehistoric Europe. The author compares traditionally identified stone skeuomorphs--that is, meaningful imitations--of metal with their putative prototypes. Three separate corpora of these stone skeuomorphs have been identified: polished stone shafthole axes from the Netherlands and surrounding areas, identified as copies of perforated, copper axes; flint daggers from Jutland, identified as copies of bronze, metal-hilted daggers; and jet spacer-plate ornaments from the British Isles, Ireland and Brittany, identified as copies of hammered gold lunulae."--

By definition, a palimpsest is "a written document, usually on vellum or parchment, that has been written upon several times, often with remnants of erased writing still visible." Palimpsests (originally published in France in 1982), one of Gerard Genette's most important works, examines the manifold relationships a text may have with prior texts. Genette describes the multiple ways a later text asks readers to read or remember an earlier one. In this regard, he treats the history and nature of parody, antinovels, pastiches, caricatures, commentary, allusion, imitations, and other textual relations.
