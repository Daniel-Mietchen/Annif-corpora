war propaganda
Wars are now mediated in unprecedented ways and through a variety of communicative forms. Correspondingly, there is an increasing awareness among those involved in war of the need to gauge and manage what is communicated. Communicating War: Media, Memory and Military contextualises these developments by locating the emergence of recent wars and terrorist activity in a wider frame of global socio-political change, highlighting the social, political and historical aspects of 'communicating war'. This includes: the remembering and forgetting of wars through cultures of collective memory and media selectivity; the organization, practice and culture of media institutions in the mediation of war information; and the strategic use of information by military institutions and terrorist organizations in the execution of war and terrorist acts. Remaining sensitive to the complexities of conflict, the book moves beyond a focus on UK and US interventions and reflects upon the communication of war in relation to all forms of conflict, particularly terrorism and under reported civil conflicts. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, Communicating War: Memory, Media, Military will be of interest to students in journalism, media, war and peace studies, international relations and international politics. Contributors include practitioners from within the journalistic and military communities and international scholars from a broad range of social sciences: Stuart Allan, David Altheide, Chris Atton, Oliver Boyd-Barrett , Nico Carpentier, Neal Curtis, Richard Keeble, Andrew Hoskins, Makram Khoury-Machool, Sarah Maltby, Donald Matheson, Lara Pawson, Ron Schleifer, Martin Shaw, Angus Taverner, John Tulloch, Howard Tumber and Jeremy Tunstall.

Propaganda is all around us, used to promote a sense of common cause and belonging, change behaviour or influence ideas, as well as to mislead, deceive, even destroy. Perhaps the greatest and most sophisticated exponent of propaganda is the modern state. Using universal themes of conflict, public education, protest and leadership, this book, which accompanies a major new exhibition at the British Library, takes a close look at the range of propaganda used by different states - and their opponents. Over the last 100 years, increased literacy, multiplying media formats, methodologies and competing messengers have required ever greater effort to persuade and influence citizens, and the book's primary focus is the 20th and 21st centuries, taking a worldwide view. But it also puts propaganda into its historical context. Different strategies are highlighted - from appeals to hearts and minds, to dictat and the cult of personality, sloganeering and news management. Posters, books, films, stamps, cartoons, music, newspapers, statistics, games, social media and the web all feature. The book concludes with a look at how the explosion in social computing is influencing the way the state attempts to persuade and control its citizens.

The informant
The Arab spring, protest movements in the EU, Russia, Turkey or elsewhere, are often labeled as twitter-revolutions. With the dissemination of print, revolts in early-modern times faced the challenge of a similar media-revolution. This book focuses mainly on representations of revolts across borders.
