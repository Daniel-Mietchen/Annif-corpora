As we transition to a service and information-based economy, information specialists are projected onto the leading edge of an emerging science. Service Science and theInformation Professional demonstrates how the power of this new transdisciplinary field can inform and transform the current information professional world. Service Science is about people, technology, information, and organizations. Service Science can be of great benefit to Information Centres everywhere, and Information Service outlets can be a tremendous field of research for this new science. iSchools and Schools of Information Studies can join Computer Science, Engineering and Business Schools in receiving research grants for the development of Service Science. Information professionals need to know this new discipline and be inspired to participate in it. •Describes service science and its increasing relevance as a discipline •Provides relevant information to those pursuing interests in Information science, Information literacy, service science, and information management •illustrates that the transition to a service and information-based economy will require libraries to deal with both information and services •Explains why information professionals need to know more about this emerging field •Shows the value of research, and the importance of participating in this field

The ultimate guide to assessing and exploiting the customer value and revenue potential of the Cloud A new business model is sweeping the world--the Cloud. And, as with any new technology, there is a great deal of fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding cloud computing. Cloudonomics radically upends the conventional wisdom, clearly explains the underlying principles and illustrates through understandable examples how Cloud computing can create compelling value--whether you are a customer, a provider, a strategist, or an investor. Cloudonomics covers everything you need to consider for the delivery of business solutions, opportunities, and customer satisfaction through the Cloud, so you can understand it--and put it to work for your business. Cloudonomics also delivers insight into when to avoid the cloud, and why. * Quantifies how customers, users, and cloud providers can collaborate to create win-wins * Reveals how to use the Laws of Cloudonomics to define strategy and guide implementation * Explains the probable evolution of cloud businesses and ecosystems * Demolishes the conventional wisdom on cloud usage, IT spend, community clouds, and the enterprise-provider cloud balance Whether you're ready for it or not, Cloud computing is here to stay. Cloudonomics provides deep insights into the business value of the Cloud for executives, practitioners, and strategists in virtually any industry--not just technology executives but also those in the marketing, operations, economics, venture capital, and financial fields.

The objectives of the research were to identify and describe the ongoing processes as they were at the moment, and to provide insight on how to develop these processes. The research covers the first stage of the three stage process development of the Business Information Services. Findings create a base line for the stages 2 and 3; otherwise these stages are not covered by this research. The second stage's objective will be to create clear individual description for the processes and modify existing information and other documents to suit the processes. The objective of the third stage is to conduct the actual process development. The research also provides suggestions on how to develop individual functions inside the process. The theoretical framework was based on literature about process management and development on sales organisation. Most of the theory is based on authors Kai Laamanen,  Jouko Hannus, Olli Lecklin, and Hans-Henry Kvist. These authors have a broad understanding of Finnish organisational process management. The study was executed in the form of two group interviews, or workshops in a basis of an action research method. The researcher and three other sales team members formed the target group, which was used for the data collection. In addition to workshops the data was collected by interviewing the sales director of the Business Information Services to ensure that the collected data was coherent with all interviewees. The analytical approach was qualitative. The results revealed a clear and simple sales process map that describes the ongoing processes inside the sales unit. The results also indicated that there was another significant process that has not been described before. This was the customer relationship management process. It was seen important to include this process to sales unit processes to clearly separate the new sales functions from customer relationship management. In conclusion, a continuous process development model, which is modified from Kvist et al. (1995,64) process development model, should be used. This ensures that the development is done effectively and continuously. Advantages of the effective process management are quicker response to market changes, flexibility, better risk management, and ability to decrease cost by cutting the amount of unnecessary functions. These create a major advantage point against rivals that either are more functional or have poorly designed processes.

The development of reference services through academic traditions, public library practice and special librarianship
Anite Finland Ltd. is a Finnish based company providing a full range of software and hardware solutions for the mobile network testing. The Nemo product portfolio consists of several products from handheld measurement tools all the way to the powerful data analysing server solutions. The main customers are mobile operators all around the world. Anti-piracy and copy protecting is a serious business, as there are skilful people trying to break the copy protections for illegal income or to gain reputation among the hacker scene. This is where the well-functioning licensing tool comes to question. In this document, licensing is a synonym for copy protection. Regarding the mobile device products, it was decided that the previous licensing method was outdated and was not flexible enough for use of today. There was a serious need for a faster and more efficient way of creating multiple licenses. When having classified data, it is mandatory to have it encrypted. There are several ways of encrypting the data but some algorithms have gained reputation over others. There are two main categories in data encryption; symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In the symmetric encryption, the same key is used for data encryption and for decryption. The most common symmetric encryption algorithm today is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which utilizes Rijndael-algorithm. In the asymmetric encryption, there are two different keys called the private key and the public key. One key is used for encryption and the other key is used for decryption. One of the most well performing asymmetric encryption algorithms is the RSA. Cloud services and cloud computing are making their way to the everyday use in the software development business. All major service providers, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon are providing their own solutions for each cloud computing service layers. The “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) -layer is an effective combination of outsourced computing power with a rather flexible software development environment. The Google App Engine is Google’s version of PaaS, and it is available for free and it offers development tools for Python, Java, PHP and Go.
