"This fourth edition of a bestseller reflects the explosion of research during the past decade regarding trace elements and the environment related to the soil-plant system. It provides information on the biogeochemistry of trace elements in the soil-plant system and how these elements control our food quality. It discusses the assessment of natural/background content of trance elements in soil, bioindication of chemical status of environmental compartments, soil remediation, and hyperaccumulation and phytoextraction of trace metals from the soil. The table of contents reflects the IUPAC's recommendation for numbering element groups, giving the new edition an updated organizational flow"--

"This is the first comprehensive text on the theory and practice of aquatic organic matter fluorescence analysis, written by the experts who pioneered the research area. This book covers the topic in the broadest possible terms, providing a common reference for making measurements that are comparable across disciplines, and allowing consistent interpretation of data and results. The book includes the fundamental physics and chemistry of organic matter fluorescence, as well as the effects of environmental factors. All aspects of sample handling, data processing, and the operation of both field and laboratory instrumentation are included, providing the practical advice required for successful fluorescence analyses. Advanced methods for data interpretation and modeling, including parallel factor analysis, are also discussed. The book will interest those establishing field, laboratory, or industrial applications of fluorescence, including advanced students and researchers in environmental chemistry, marine science, environmental geosciences, environmental engineering, soil science, and physical geography"--

Summarizing current knowledge of grouse biology, this volume is organized in four sections--spatial ecology, habitat relationships, population biology, and conservation and management--and offers insights into spatial requirements, movements, and demography of grouse. Much of the research employs emerging tools in ecology that span biogeochemistry, molecular genetics, endocrinology, radio-telemetry, and remote sensing.--Adapted from publisher description on back cover.

Role of photochemical reactions in the biogeochemical cycling of detrital carbon in aquatic environments
Considers how the basic chemical conditions of the Earth - from atmosphere to soil to seawater - have been and are being affected by the existence of life. This title helps students extrapolate small-scale examples to the global level, and also discusses the instrumentation being used by NASA and its role in studies of global change.
