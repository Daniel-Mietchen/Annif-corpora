Colin McEvedy's highly original historical atlases revolutionised the way the history of the Western world was seen. In four books he spanned from the emergence of Homo erectus in Europe in around 500,000 BC to the present day. But his greatest enthusiasm was always for the classical world. For twenty years as he travelled to all the major sites from Babylon to Pompeii, McEvedy was quietly compiling the book he had always wanted to write. In Cities of the Classical World he could at last focus on its cities, map them and tell their fascinating stories. This labour of love offers a compelling imaginative guide to the centres of ancient civilization, large and small, that shaped the world as we know it today. Fascinating information about the cities sits alongside clear maps that trace their thoroughfares and defences, monuments and mistakes. And in understanding them the history of the ancient world unfolds fresh and new.

Topographies of Popular Culture departs from the deceptively simple notion that popular culture always takes place somewhere. By studying the spatial and topographic imaginations at work in popular culture, the book identifies and illustrates several specific tendencies that deserve increased attention in studies of the popular. In combining the study of popular texts with a broad variety of geographical contexts, the volume presents a global and cross-cultural approach to popular culture's topographies. In part, Topographies of Popular Culture takes its cue from recent theorisations of spatiality in the field of critical theory, and from such global transformations as the processes and after-effects of decolonisation and globalisation. It contemplates the spatiality of genre and the interactions between the local and the global, as well as the increasing circulation and adaptation of popular texts across the globe. The ten individual chapters analyse the spaces of popular culture at a scale that extends from an indivisual's everyday experience to genuinely global questions, offering new theoretical and analytical insights into the relation between spatiality and the popular.

Usually geomorphology, structural geology and engineering geology provide descriptions of slope instability in quite distinctive ways. This new research is based on combined approaches to providing an integrated view of the operative slope processes. 'Slope Tectonics' is the term adopted here to refer to those deformations that are induced or fully controlled by the slope morphology, and that generate features which can be compared to those created by tectonic activity. Such deformation can be induced by the stress field in a slope which is mainly controlled by gravity, topography and the geological setting created by the geodynamic context. The content of this book includes slope-deformation characterization using morphology and evolution, mechanical behaviour of the material, modes of failure and collapse, influence of lithology and structural features, and the role played by controlling factors. The contributions cover broad aspects of slope tectonics that attempt to underline a multidisciplinary approach, which should create a better framework for studies of slope instability.--

"This is a concise but comprehensive text describing visible and palpable anatomy and a valuable companion to clinical studies. It contains over 240 colour photographs with line drawings superimposed to demonstrate the major structures that can be felt, seen, moved or listened to; Regionally organised chapters covering all areas of male and female anatomy; and line drawings indicating the surface markings of deep structures together with sites for injection of local anaesthetic, accessing blood vessels and taking biopsies."--BOOK JACKET.

The objective of this paper is to differentiate the landscape in the treeline ecotone in Subarctic Finland with an examination of its mosaic structure and functional role in treeline dynamics. Highly varying topography is a key factor controlling drainage conditions, vegetation, local climates and soils. Natural drainage classes, soil data (pH, Corg, Nt, C/N ratio, moisture) and dominant vegetation were used to characterize site conditions and to show the grouping of six representative sites along a synthetic topographical transect (model). The abrupt increase in soil moisture and pH values at the distal end of the lowest zones indicates a relatively sharp and ecologically important limit between well drained sites (ridge tops, upper valley side, interfluves) and valleys with both poorly and very poorly drained sites. Remains of birch wood in wind-scarps, hummocks and peaty layers give evidence of former open birch forest in present treeless sites. Forest decline has enforced the contrasts in site conditions between windswept and snow accumulating topography. The landscape mosaic and resultant site conditions are strongly influencing treeline dynamics and consequently, the landscape mosaic needs to be carefully considered when discussing the possible effects of the changing climate in the treeline ecotone.
