Herodot und das Persische Weltreich = Herodotus and the Persian Empire : Akten des 3. Internationalen Kolloquiums zum Thema "Vorderasien im Spannungsfeld klassischer und altorientalischer Ãœberlieferungen," Innsbruck, 24.-28. November 2008
"Herodotus and the Persian Empire" comprises contributions of an international conference held in Innsbruck in November 2008, which was attended by renowned scholars from Europe, America and Australia. The volume is published within a larger context of research. Its preoccupation is centred on a scholarly discussion of the Greek historiography, focussing on the Historical World of Ancient Middle East. The newly established series "Classica et Orientalia" offers a stage of publication to such studies like "Ktesias' World" (CLeO 1), "The Achaemenid Court" (CLeO 2) and "Herodotus and the Persian Empire" (CLeO 3). In the current volume, 33 contributors discuss Herodotus' Histories under various points of view, in essays written in English as well as German. On the basis of Ancient Near Eastern source material, the texts are analyzed within literary studies.

Amidst the Iran-Iraq War, two Iraqi soldiers find themselves stationed on an isolated mountain peak with orders to observe the enemy's troop movements. As they watch the brutal destruction brought about by the intelligence they have gathered, their loyalty to their country and each other is tested. As in all wars, both Iraq and Iran demonized each other as the war raged during the 1980s.In "Fortune Told in Blood", written during the mid-1990s as Iran was recovering, Davud Ghaffarzadegan labours to undo the damage caused by this process. The author, an Iranian, writes from the Iraqi perspective, thus humanizing the enemy and challenging his reader to do so as well. A deft and economical storyteller, Davud Ghaffarzadegan has received considerable critical and popular acclaim in Iran, though his work has never before been translated into English. M. R. Ghanoonparvar's exquisite translation remedies this oversight and expands the body of literature on the Iran-Iraq War available to the West.
