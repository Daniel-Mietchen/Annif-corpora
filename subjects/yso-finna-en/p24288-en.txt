Greek and Roman Historiography is a collection of important articles from the last thirty years which treat the ways in which the ancient Greeks and Romans thought about and wrote their histories. Six of these articles have been translated into English for the first time. Avoiding issues such as sources and reliability which were the concern of earlier scholarship, the contributors focus much more on how the ancients themselves engaged with their past: the relationship between myth and history; the role of memory and oral tradition as they shaped both Greek and Roman notions of the past; the role of the historian in giving form and meaning to his history; and the different notions of historical truth and falsehood. A specially written introduction places the essays in the larger context of earlier and more recent trends in the study of Greek and Roman historiography.

While the creation of Dolly the sheep, the world's most famous clone, triggered an enormous amount of discussion about human cloning, in Dolly Mixtures the anthropologist Sarah Franklin looks beyond that much-rehearsed controversy to some of the other reasons why the iconic animal's birth and death were significant. Building on the work of historians and anthropologists, Franklin reveals Dolly as the embodiment of agricultural, scientific, social, and commercial histories which are, in turn, bound up with national and imperial aspirations. Dolly was the offspring of a long tradition of animal domestication, as well as the more recent histories of capital accumulation through selective breeding, and enhanced national competitiveness through the control of biocapital. Franklin traces Dolly's connections to Britain's centuries-old sheep and wool markets (which were vital to the nation's industrial revolution) and to Britain's export of animals to its colonies - particularly Australia - to expand markets and produce wealth. Moving forward in time, she explains the celebrity sheep's links to the embryonic cell lines and global bioscientific innovation of the late twentieth century and early twenty-first.

Starting with Foucault : an introduction to genealogy
"The issue of the senses and sensual perception in Michel Foucault's thought has been a source of prolific discussion already for quite some time. Often, Foucault has been accused of overemphasizing the centrality of sight, and has been portrayed as yet another thinker representative of Western ocularcentricism. This innovative new work seeks to challenge this portrait by presenting an alternative view of Foucault as a thinker for whom the sound, voice, hearing, and listening, the auditory-sonorous, actually did matter.Illustrating how the auditory-sonorous relates most integrally to the most pertinent issues of Foucault - the intertwinement and confrontations of power, knowledge, and resistance - the book both presents novel readings of some of Foucault's most widely read and commented-on works (such as Discipline and Punish, the first volume of History of Sexuality), and discusses the variety of his lectures, essays, and interviews, some of which have not been noted before. Moving beyond a commentary on Foucault, Siisiäinen goes on to examine other philosophers and political thinkers (including Roland Barthes, Jean-Luc Nancy and Jacques Rancière) in this context in order to bring to the fore the potentials in Foucault's work for the generation of a new perspective for the political genealogy of the sound, hearing, and listening, approaching the former as a key locus of contemporary political struggles.This work will be of great interest to students and scholars in a range of areas including political theory, philosophy, and cultural studies." --Publisher's description.
