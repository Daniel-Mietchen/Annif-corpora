This thesis is a study of the landscape degradation in Australia after the European settlement of the continent and how the condition of the land today can be understood in that context. Many records show that the state of the environment has been greatly degraded since the arrival of the first explorers and stockmen who followed them. As a result of intensive grazing and other exploitative land uses many natural features that used to regulate the hydrological balance in the erratic and extreme conditions of Australian climate were destroyed. Altered patterns of runoff and infiltration resulting from the loss or riparian vegetation, reeds and ground cover have lead to serious erosion and incision of floodplain watercourses. This has further impacts on the flooding patterns and water retention capacity of the floodplains and is followed by dehydration and loss of productivity and fertility. Restorative land management methods including Natural Sequence Farming recognise the natural potential of the landscape and use mimicry of biological systems to rehabilitate the land and its hydrological balance. Those methods include stock management, soil conditioning, revegetation as well as structures called fascines, gabions and leaky weirs for repair of erosion gullies and incised streams. The functioning principles of those structures are dissipating the kinetic energy of water which reduces the erosive power of the flow and allows other natural recovery processes to be initiated. As this study represents only a very shallow overview on the thesis topic, especially those practicalities regarding restoration operations, intrested readers are recommended to the browse the reference material on their own.

To be an environmentalist early in the twenty-first century is always to be defending, arguing, acknowledging the hurdles we face in our efforts to protect wild places and fight climate change. But let's be honest: hedging has never inspired anyone. So what if we stopped hedging? What if we grounded our efforts to solve environmental problems in hope instead, and let nature make our case for us? That's what George Monbiot does in Feral, a lyrical, unabashedly romantic vision of how, by inviting nature back into our lives, we can simultaneously cure our "ecological boredom" and begin repairing centuries of environmental damage. Monbiot takes readers on an enchanting journey around the world to explore ecosystems that have been "rewilded": freed from human intervention and allowed--in some cases for the first time in millennia--to resume their natural ecological processes. We share his awe, and wonder, as he kayaks among dolphins and seabirds off the coast of Wales and wanders the forests of Eastern Europe, where lynx and wolf packs are reclaiming their ancient hunting grounds. Through his eyes, we see environmental success--and begin to envision a future world where humans and nature are no longer separate and antagonistic, but are together part of a single, healing world.
