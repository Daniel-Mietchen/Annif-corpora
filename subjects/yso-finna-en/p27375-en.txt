"'The Art of Fermentation' is the most comprehensive guide to do-it-yourself home fermentation ever published. Sandor Katz presents the concepts and processes behind fermentation in ways that are simple enough to guide a reader through their first experience making sauerkraut or yogurt, and in-depth enough to provide greater understanding and insight for experienced practitioners. While Katz expertly contextualizes fermentation in terms of biological and cultural evolution, health and nutrition, and even economics, this is primarily a compendium of practical information--how the processes work; parameters for safety; techniques for effective preservation; troubleshooting; and more. With full-color illustrations and extended resources, this book provides essential wisdom for cooks, homesteaders, farmers, gleaners, foragers, and food lovers of any kind who want to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for arguably the oldest form of food preservation, and part of the roots of culture itself. Readers will find detailed information on fermenting vegetables; sugars into alcohol (meads, wines, and ciders); sour tonic beverages; milk; grains and starchy tubers; beers (and other grain-based alcoholic beverages); beans; seeds; nuts; fish; meat; and eggs, as well as growing mold cultures, using fermentation in agriculture, art, and energy production, and considerations for commercial enterprises. Sandor Katz has introduced what will undoubtedly remain a classic in food literature, and is the first--and only--of its kind"--

Optimization of yield and productivity in fed-batch fermentation
Enzymes are studied in different fields of biotechnology to reduce energy consumption, environmental effects and costs for the industry. Enzymes allow more effective production and better product quality than the use of chemical compounds. Enzymes are produced and studied in batch, continuous or fed-batch fermentations. This study concentrates on fed-batch fermentation. The focus is on the production of enzymes for the pulp and paper industry and optimization of the yield and productivity of fed-batch fermentation. The enzymes examined in this study were produced intracellularly by bacterial cells. The optimization of the yield and productivity were examined with the use of different feed profiles to see the growth trends of bacterial cells and how they produce the desired enzymes in the presence of different concentrations of glucose. Optical density, enzyme activity, glucose and lactate were measured from the fermentations to get the results for yield and productivity. The optimal yield and productivity is achieved by finding a glucose feed rate which gives the best possible balance for cell growth and product formation. Based on the yield and productivity results, the fed-batch fermentation can be improved and stabilized. This study deals with enzymes in the pulp and paper industry, the differences between the fermentation types mentioned above, the fermentation procedure and sampling, as well as experiments with the feed profiles and the analyses, errors and results.
