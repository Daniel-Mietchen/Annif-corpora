The social media bible : tactics, tools, and strategies for business success
Today, most firms employ online and offline distribution channels. Customers combine both channels for information search and purchase. However, researchers and practitioners are still lacking insight concerning the creation of additional customer value, in terms of a seamless purchase experience, by combining the online and offline channels. Also, it is unclear if these channel integration activities can actually help multichannel firms obtain a strategic advantage over their online pureplay competitors. Jochen Binder investigates how, why, and to what extent an integrated online channel increases customer value and leads to higher willingness to pay, customer loyalty and purchase intention in a firm's online and offline stores.

"Rapid changes in communication technologies shifted the media environment from one of scarcity to one characterized by abundance. Advertisers are paying more and more money to reach fewer and fewer people, as audiences consume endless streams of content across different platforms. When you can no longer buy enough attention for advertising to remain efficient -- how do brands respond?Spanning communication theory, neuroscience, creativity and innovation, media history, popular culture, branding, and emerging technologies, Paid Attention explores how ideas move people and how advertising can and should change in response to changes in the communication landscape.Topics covered include: a critical look at market research, modern theories of communication, the vanishing difference between content, media, and advertising, what ideas are and how to get them, and the future of advertising.

"Spanning communication theory, neuroscience, creativity and innovation, media history, branding and emerging technologies, Paid Attention explores how ideas move people and how advertising can and should change in response to changes in the communications landscape. A modern model for how brands operate and innovate in the evolving market for ideas, it contains both beliefs that can guide behaviour and practical tools and examples to help account planners and strategists in their jobs and careers. Paid Attention provides a framework for brands and market research based on the emerging context of behavioural economics. It references a wide body of theory and praxis, from neuroscience, advertising research, behavioural economics, psychology, sociology, technology and even science fiction. Mapping advertising to a wider analysis of culture, it appeals to media scholars and anyone interested in today's media-saturated culture"--

"Ads by Google" and other social media business models
In this volume, the authors apply insights from a variety of perspectives to explore the alignment among strategy, organization design, process and human resource management, and e-business practices on developing successful social networking programs with particular regard to applying such initiatives against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and challenges to traditional business models. Showcasing in-depth case studies, the authors present emerging approaches to analyze the impact of investment in social networking sites, aligning internal resources, and measuring effects on positioning, branding, and new business creation. The fact that a growing proportion of the world population has a relationship with social networking sites could prove very valuable for companies. The question is whether this represents a business opportunity, whether companies know how to make the most of it and if they will make the necessary efforts to adapt to these new platforms. In the modern world, social networking sites have enormous potential for large as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); most companies are aware of the need for a presence on social networking sites, but at present their e-business strategies are part of their medium and long-term strategic planning and only a small percentage have been put into practice. In short, this book attempts to answer the following questions: Is there a business opportunity for companies on social networking sites? Do they know how to make the most of it? Are they willing to make the necessary effort to adapt? Can e-business strategies contribute to company creation and the success of already existing businesses? And if so, how?
