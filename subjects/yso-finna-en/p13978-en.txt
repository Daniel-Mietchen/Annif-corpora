The museum environment
"Education departments in museums of all kinds serve millions of students and adult learners every year, using the objects and other resources of the museum to teach and inspire. The rapidly growing field of museum education provides hands-on, experiential learning, with museum educators often working closely with local school boards to supplement and enhance public school curricula. In Teaching the Museum, twenty contributors from across the exciting field of museum education offer innovative insights, anecdotes, and advice for best practices on how to realize the museum's full potential as an educational institution. From the balance between education and entertainment; to meeting the needs of both one's audience and the collection; to understanding connections between how we learn and how exhibits and programming are designed; this book will appeal to museum educators, students, and teachers seeking to learn more about the field"--Provided by publisher.

Rethinking the museum and other meditations
"From the earliest museums established by Western missionaries in order to implement religious and political power, to the role they have played in the formation of the modern Chinese state, the origin and development of museums in mainland China differ significantly from those in the West. The occurrence of museums in mainland China in the late nineteenth century was primarily a result of internal and external conflicts, Westernization and colonialism, and as such they were never established solely for enjoyment and leisure. Using a historical and anthropological framework, this book provides a holistic and critical review on the establishment and development of museums in mainland China from 1840 to the present day, and shows how museums in China have been used by a wide range of social, political, and state actors for a number of economic, religious, political and ideological purposes. Indeed, Tracey L-D Lu examines the key role played by museums in reinforcing social segmentation, influencing the economy, protecting cultural heritage and the construction and enhancement of ethnic identities and nationalism, and how they have throughout their history helped the powerful to govern the less powerful or the powerless. More broadly, this book provides important comparative insights on museology and heritage management, and questions who the key stakeholders are, how museums reflect broader social and cultural changes, and the relationship between museum and heritage management. Drawing on extensive archival research and anthropological fieldwork, as well as the author's experience working as a museum curator in mainland China in the late 1980s"--

Museum Theory showcases innovative theoretical formations that have defined museum studies and which point the way towards its future. Museum Practice addresses areas of museum work––especially those that have been neglected in the existing critical literature––in order to re–articulate and transcend the theory practice division. Museum Media focuses on the architecture and space of museums, including the diverse media of display. Museum Transformations addresses the social, cultural, political, and economic developments that are shaping and re–shaping museums.
