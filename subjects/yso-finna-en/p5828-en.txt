This paper discusses the Russian electricity reform process up until late 2010. In particular, the paper situates the Russian reform in the international context by comparing it with the experiences of other countries. Further, the paper strives to underline the importance of the reform for the Russian economy at large, both as an inevitable step to avoid a looming energy crisis and as a striking example of implementing a liberal, large-scale economic reform in Putin's Russia.   .

No analysis of the Russian economy today can ignore the role of energy production. Russia is the world's largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, the world's third largest consumer of energy and a global giant in hydrocarbon exports. But just how big is the actual contribution of oil and gas production to national economic output? Who is discovering, pumping and shipping Russia's oil? What is the energy sector's role in government revenue and Russia's external balance? This issue of BOFIT Online comprises nine short articles with timely insights into the challenges facing Russia's energy sector.  Key words: Russia, energy, natural gas, oil, state economy, electricity production .
Electricity market reform is currently an ongoing process in Russia, promoting competitive wholesale and retail sectors.The overall goal of the reform is to attract investments and to improve the efficiency of the Russian electricity industry.The growing economy is consuming more and more electricity and the old capacity is deteriorating.There have been electricity shortages already and more severe ones are forecasted to occur this winter.Russia needs to speed up the reform and continue the stable development of its economy in order to attract investments to the sector.This could improve the situation in the medium term, but in the short term significant progress can be achieved by improving the efficiency of the electricity sector.  Keywords: Russia, electricity, liberalisation .

Charging of electric vehicles is becoming more and more common. Charging of electric vehicles does not only need a functioning infrastructure but also various information systems to handle data in the process. The purpose of this thesis was to study how a completely new information system for handling energy information collected in the process of charging electric cars could be built by using existing energy sector information systems. The research problem for this thesis was provided by Empower IM Oy. The research for this thesis was mainly done by studying the OCPP protocol and design documents of Empower IM’s information systems. Some of the information was collected by interviewing specialists and by participating in meetings and presentations. The end result of this thesis is a data model for ESSP, a study of the OCPP protocol and use cases how the OCPP is used in ESSP functions. The data model describes how the objects of electric vehicle charging are modelled using the EnerIM CIS database.

Regulatory reform in Greece
Do current electricity market designs ensure a sufficient electricity supply at all times? This topic is currently the subject of intense debate across Europe, and several major countries such as Germany, the UK, France and Italy have decided that additional measures - so-called capacity remuneration mechanisms - are needed to supplement current market designs. This report describes and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of a range of measures proposed or currently implemented across Europe, and includes both best estimates of how the implementation of these measures will impact Nordic electricity prices as well as recommendations to the Nordic countries regarding a cost-efficient path to ensuring the Nordic security of supply.
