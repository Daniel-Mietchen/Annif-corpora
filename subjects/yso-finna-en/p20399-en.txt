"From the same team that produced the monumental five-volume architectural history of New York comes the definitive work on the development of the garden suburb, a phenomenon that first emerged in England in the 1830s and still dominates residential architecture today"--
Although urban allotment gardening dates back to the nineteenth century, it has recently undergone a renaissance of interest and popularity. This is the result of greater concern over urban greenspace, food security and quality of life. This book presents a comprehensive, research-based overview of the various features, benefits and values associated with urban allotment gardening in Europe. The book is based on a European COST Action project, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over Europe for the first detailed exploration of the subject on a continent-wide scale. It assesses the policy, planning and design aspects, as well as the social and ecological benefits of urban allotment gardening. Through an examination of the wide range of different traditions and practices across Europe, it brings together the most recent research to discuss the latest evolutions of urban allotment gardening and to help raise awareness and fill knowledge gaps. The book provides a multidisciplinary perspective, including insights from horticulture and soil science, ecology, sociology, urban geography, landscape, planning and design. The themes are underpinned by case studies from a number of European countries which supply a wide range of examples to illustrate different key issues.
Landscape and power in Vienna
Adam felt alone in the strange, new city. He missed the colours and friendships of his faraway home. But when a teacher at school gives him a few seeds, she plants an idea in him - an idea that could transform his grey world for ever. Michael Foreman's beautifully-illustrated story is a powerful fable of how friendship can grow in our world.

For centuries, China's Forbidden City has captured the world's imagination. Yet the elegant, intimate Qianlong Garden - itself within a 'mini-Forbidden City' inside the Forbidden City - has remained sequestered from public view. This title gives an analysis of the garden, which is one of the most refined and elegant of imperial Chinese gardens.

"Dictionary for Managing Trees in Urban Environments is a comprehensive list of terms used in the universal management of urban trees. Many of the terms are from Arboricultural science, while others are derived from unproven but commonly applied concepts. Some new concepts have been introduced where the existing terminology to describe trees was limited or nonexistent. This dictionary allows for broad application and use by a wide variety of people and conveys in plain language concepts that are sometimes complex. Most major terms have been cross referenced and diagrams have been added for greater understanding. Dictionary for Managing Trees in Urban Environments promotes a greater understanding of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry, and will assist in the preparation of reports for the management of trees, procedures and planning instruments, such as Tree Management Policies and Tree Management Orders."--Provided by publisher.
