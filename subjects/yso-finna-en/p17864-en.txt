Experiencing music technology : software, data and hardware
Machine Models of Music brings together representative models ranging from Mozart's "Musical Dice Game" to a classic article by Marvin Minsky and current research to illustrate the rich impact that artificial intelligence has had on the understanding and composition of traditional music, and to demonstrate the ways in which music can push the boundaries of traditional AI research. Major sections of the book take up pioneering research in generate-and-test composition (Lejaren Hiller, Frederick Brooks, Jr., Stanley Gill); composition parsing (Allen Forte, Herbert Simon, Terry Winograd); heuristic composition (John Rothgeb, James Moorer, Stephen Smoliar); generative grammars (Otto Laske, Gary Rader, Johan Sundberg, Fred Lerdahl); alternative theories (Marvin Minsky, James Meehan); composition tools (Charles Ames, Kemal Ebcioglu, David Cope, Christopher Fry); and new directions (David Levitt, Christopher Longuet-Higgins, Jamshed Bharucha, Stephan Schwanauer).
