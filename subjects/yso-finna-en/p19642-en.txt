Law after modernity
"To speak of human rights is to speak of proportionality. It is no exaggeration to claim that proportionality has overtaken rights as the orienting idea in contemporary human rights law and scholarship. Proportionality has been received into the constitutional doctrine of courts in continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, and South Africa, as well as the jurisprudence of treaty-based legal systems like the European Court of Human Rights, giving rise to claims of a global model, a received approach, or, simply, the best-practice standard of rights adjudication. Even in the United States, which is widely understood to have formally rejected proportionality, some argue that the various levels of scrutiny adopted by the US Supreme Court are analogous to the standard questions posed by proportionality. As proportionality scholars are well aware, some of the early literature on balancing and rights is American, with special reference to the First Amendment. Notwithstanding proportionality's popularity, there is no consensus on its methodology. Much less does the use of a proportionality doctrine guarantee consensus on substantive rights questions. What the principle of proportionality promises is a common analytical framework, a framework the significance of which is not in its ubiquity (a mere fact), but because its structure influences (some would say controls) how courts reason to conclusions in many of the great moral and political questions confronting political communities. As a framework, proportionality analysis is superficially straightforward, setting out four questions in evaluating whether the limitation of a right is justifiable. A serviceable - but by no means canonical"--

China's legal soul : the modern Chinese legal identity in historical context
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the present state of legal aid in China. On one level, this is an easy question. All measures of quantity indicate real progress since the Chinese government decided to construct a national legal aid system in 1994. Since then, the Ministry of Justice has established 32,000 legal aid organizations and over 55,000 legal aid stations at the county, district, provincial, and municipal levels. Yet upon closer inspection, these figures raise as many questions as they answer. How many citizens need aid but didn't receive it? What impact did the legal aid experience have on those who sought assistance? What types of cases were handled, and perhaps more importantly, what types of cases weren't? This study seeks to identify answers to these and other questions.
