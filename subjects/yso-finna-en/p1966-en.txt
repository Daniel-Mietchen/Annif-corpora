The main aim of this thesis has been to give the reader fisrt of all a general knowledge of the main concepts that are contained within it, such as internationalization, exporting and the Spanish market. This is an objective decided together with the commissioner InnoConnections with the aim of being able to find export organizations based in Madrid and that are interested in working in the Nordic / Finnish market. The process of researching has not been simple, and also it has not lead to the expected results, which were to be able to contact with at least a few organizations and obtain some feedback from them. Most intents of making contact with the given organizations have received no feedback, leading to a series of conclusions that point to the fact that this particular period in time may not be the best to approach the Spanish market, as it is affected by a strong economic crisis which makes all businesses fearful of putting at risk any of their assets. However, these findings may still be useful to the commissioner as well as other businesses planning to approach such market, as they give an insight to how Spanish companies are actually reacting to this difficult situation and therefore gives the opportunity to businesses to possibly look for other options when trying to internationalize or look for Spanish customers, as at this point in time they are companies that are being very cautious and that may not be willing to extend to other countries as this is often considered risky.

The forthcoming 20-year period offers an unprecedented opportunity for spiritual growth. For the first time since the Golden Era of Atlantis, those who are ready can be bathed in ninth-dimensional frequencies to accelerate the ascension process. In this book, Diana Cooper and Tim Whild share their incredible knowledge of the Golden Era of Atlantis and offer information, exercises and meditations to become an Enlightened Master in this lifetime. They connect you to the highest frequency dragons, unicorns, angels and great Ascended Masters who are assisting you from many universes to move into your true potential. The entire book vibrates at the fifth to seventh dimensions, interwoven with incredible shining ninth-dimensional threads. Lord Kuthumi, the World Teacher, takes you into his 12 teaching temples where he and great Universal Angels and Masters take you on a training course into enlightenment and mastery. In addition, many of the greatest masters who serve our planet share their secrets and assistance. Lord Voosloo, the highest frequency High Priest to have served in Atlantis, has allowed us to access his incredible energy to take the reader to the highest levels now achievable on planet Earth. This book is a must-read for those who wish to fulfil their soul missions in this life and serve Gaia in the fifth dimension and beyond.

Reach and supra-local consciousness in the medieval Nordic periphery
"This book focuses on the diverse interrelationships between aging and transnationalism. It argues that the lives of older people are increasingly entangled in transnational contexts on the social as well as the cultural, economic and political levels. Within these contexts, older people both actively contribute to and are affected by border-crossing processes. In addition, while some may voluntarily opt for adding a transnational dimension to their lives, others may have less choice in the matter. Transnational aging, therefore, provides a critical lens on how older people shape, organize and cope with life in contexts that are no longer bound to the frame of a single nation-state. Accordingly, the book emphasizes the agency of older people as well as the personal and structural constraints of their situations. The chapters in this book reveal these aspects by approaching transnational aging from different methodological angles, such as ethnographic research, comparative studies, quantitative data, and policy and discourse analysis. Geographically, the chapters cover a wide range of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, such as Namibia, Thailand, Russia, Germany, the United States and Ecuador"--

This article is based on my doctoral dissertation (Mähönen 2011) on the role of personal contact experiences and perceived social norms in the outgroup attitude formation of youth. As research on qualitatively different forms of outgroup attitudes improves our opportunities to predict intergroup behaviour and improve intergroup relations, the predictors of both explicit (i.e. deliberate, consciously controlled) and implicit (i.e. spontaneous, automatically activated) outgroup attitudes of youth were addressed. In the study, the outgroup attitudes and their predictors of 14-17 year old Finnish majority youth and Russian-speaking minority youth living in Finland were examined. In the article, I discuss the Finnish attitude climate, present the main findings and contributions of the study, and offer some research ethical considerations related to the studying of ethnic intergroup relations among youth..
