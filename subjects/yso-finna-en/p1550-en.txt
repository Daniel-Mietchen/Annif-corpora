Mobile application security
In mobile communications technology, increasing demand for faster connection speeds requires more from next generation mobile networks. 3GPP is a partnership organization consisting of many corporations which have interest in the future of mobile communication technology and is responsible for specifying the next generation cellular system. This next generation system is known as LTE-Advanced, and is an evolution of the original LTE system. To achieve faster transfer of data, an increase in transmission bandwidth is considered essential. This increase of transmission bandwidth is possible with Carrier Aggregation. In LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation, multiple LTE carriers can be combined to widen transmission bandwidth. However, with certain frequency band configurations there would be harmonic relation between bands used to aggregate carriers. This harmonic issue would cause sensitivity degradation in User Equipment (UE). In this thesis the harmonic issue with band configuration of 4 and 17 was examined. The goal was to find the worst case scenario for sensitivity degradation and see if it correlated with what was specified by 3GPP. UE sensitivity was measured with different power levels and bandwidths of artificially created LTE SC-FDMA 3rd harmonic distortion. Sensitivity was also measured by sweeping a continuous wave (CW) carrier across the channel used by the receiver of the UE to see if some parts of the channel would be more sensitive to interference than others. The results of these measurements confirm that 3GPP specifications for the band configuration and harmonic issue in LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation are correct. This thesis was carried out for Nokia Corporation to support the international 3GPP standardization process.
