Genimate Ltd needed a new calibration application to replace the old system they had for their coin counter. The project started off as a work practice and afterwards continued as a thesis.  The main objective of the thesis was to finalize the application started on the practice and prepare it for implementation. The theoretical part of this thesis contains comprehensive documentation for the application, which will be useful to users but also to developers continuing with the application. Also all of the program code was commented which will also help developers' work.  The references for the application came from the documentation for the coin counter. All the other information came from inside the organization and by familiarization with the old system. Work was strongly based on Java expertise.  Considering the short timeframe the project overall went quite well. Even though some of the features are missing, the application should be usable. Overall the project gave a good idea on how software projects can and should progress.

Abrstract: Laboratories have multiple devices that require maintenance and calibration performed on a regular basis. There are several standards concerning calibration of these devices and calibration is a fundamental part of good laboratory practice. The objective of this thesis was to define the customer requirements for new laboratory instrument calibration software. The customer requirements were identified with a customer needs survey. The theoretical framework for this thesis is software requirements engi-neering, gathering and managing the requirements. After the identification of the customer needs they were converted in to the requirements for the software. The project is assigned by Sartorius Biohit Liquid Handling Oy. As the result of this project the customer requirements for new calibration software for la-boratory instruments were produced. These requirements can be used when requesting tenders and when creating technical requirements for the software.
