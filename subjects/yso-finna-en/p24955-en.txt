Social and emotional learning (SEL) is a dominant orthodoxy in education systems around the world. To many it is a panacea; to others it is a waste of time and resources. This important new book provides the first in-depth, authoritative and balanced examination of the critical issues pervading the field. An extensive and thorough review of the international research literature has enabled each substantive aspect of SEL to be examined through a critical lens. The book investigates key topics such as: definitions and conceptualization -- origins and influences -- international policy and practice -- assessment and monitoring -- implementation -- outcomes. The book highlights key strengths and significant flaws in SEL theory and research, and sets the agenda for the next generation of inquiry in the field.

Keith Oatley's 3rd edition of Understanding Emotions emphasizes the value of emotions and explores the latest research with practical concerns for clinical problems, education and everyday understanding. The text extends across a broad range of disciplines and covers the entire lifespan from infancy to adulthood. It includes sections on the study of emotion, the different elements of emotion, evidence of how emotions govern and organize social life, and emotion and individual functioning, including psychological disorders and well being. Furthermore, the text offers combined chapters on evolutionary and cultural approaches, studies of new expressions (love, desire) as well as new systems of communication (touch, music), findings on emotion and the central nervous systems, and studies on the role of emotion in moral judgment. Discussions of how popular and classical movies emphasize emotions show how to keep an emotion diary to track one's emotions and interactions.
