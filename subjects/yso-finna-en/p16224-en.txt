This study overviews the current state of the Chinese state enterprises and bank reforms.Transformation of command economy into market economy has until recently been relatively frictionless, at least in retrospective to other command economies. Recently economic growth has become sluggish which has been blamed on structural factors.Corporate governance reform is recognized as the next key issue of reforms.Despite the economic weight of state owned enterprises is diminishing, the financial sector is heavily linked to the SOE.The current economic woes result from the reckless lending practices, the money was given to those with political influence instead of those deserving.Now, the amount of bad debt is threatening the stability of the financial sector. Institutions required for effective corporate governance are emerging.However, the state wants to retain control over the former state owned enterprises, which hinders the proper functioning of the market.Piecemeal reforms do not appear to suffice and there are some serious doubts of the capacity to finance the reforms.  Keywords: China, Economic Reforms, State Owned Enterprises, Corporate Control .

Abstract: Social Media in the B2B Banking & Finance Landscape : Case: Nordic Investment Bank. The early days of the Internet, Web 1.0, did not facilitate third-party content creation and sharing, as most pages were closed to external editing, making users only consumers of information. Corresponding with post-millennium technological developments and innovations, Web 2.0 and different social media platforms arose, opening up a new world of connectivity. Web 2.0, having acted as a playground for individuals for a decade, has now become increasingly more relevant for companies and businesses seeking to extend stakeholder reach and awareness. As a part of a new communication model, social media differs greatly from traditional marketing and communication endeavours. This study highlights some of the new, affiliated opportunities for a small organisation: the main allure being cost efficiency while the difficulty to conceptualise return on investment (ROI) hinders management support. Nowadays, companies and consultants specialise in tailor-made social media entry strategies and campaigns, although they often come with a substantial price-tag. This study therefore looks at hands-on, cost-efficient tactics that can be implemented for the Nordic Investment Bank, as a small international financial institution. The study recommends the implementation of different tactics for Twitter, LinkedIn and Storify as well as blogs to increase the awareness of everyday institutional activities. Additionally, the study postulates that Facebook as a platform is inapt when promoting commercial institutional activities. Emphasising the emergent nature of social media and its effect on planning and control, this study advocates adopting an editorial calendar as well as a monitoring tool to ensure that the social media campaign stays aligned with original goals. Lastly, areas for future study are suggested including how social media could affect online reporting processes, guidelines for how to address employee social media usage in banking and finance as well as how to establish an industry monetary social media ROI.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine and analyze the financial markets of China. The intention was to form a comprehensive picture of the current state and the latest developments of the markets. Specific attention was paid to the accessibility and opportunities offered to foreign participants in the markets. The study concentrates on mainland China, excluding Hong Kong and Macau. The research was conducted using qualitative methodology, by collecting data first and then analyzing it using financial market theories. The data was collected from various sources, including business news, academic journals, official websites, statistics databases and interviews. The analysis was based on different aspects of efficient markets; the allocative, operational and informational efficiencies. The results revealed that while the financial markets of China have a modern and quickly developing appearance, they are still far from being open and efficient. The most important limiting factor in the financial markets is the regulation of the foreign exchange market. The government also holds a strong control over all the other aspects of the markets as well. The access for foreign companies is currently restricted; only a limited number of licensed foreign institutions are allowed to operate with the local currency, and even then only within set quotas. The markets are, however, constantly developing. The foreign exchange is slowly opening up, presenting new investment opportunities for foreign investors in the future.

"In many non-Western contexts, modernization has tended to be equated with Westernization, and hence with an abandonment of authentic indigenous identities and values. This is evident in the recent history of many Asian societies, where efforts to modernize - spurred on by the spectre of foreign domination - have often been accompanied by determined attempts to stamp national variants of modernity with the brand of local authenticity: 'Asian values', 'Chinese characteristics', a Japanese cultural 'essence' and so forth. Highlighting (or exaggerating) associations between the more unsettling consequences of modernization and alien influence has thus formed part of a strategy whereby elites in many Asian societies have sought to construct new forms of legitimacy for old patterns of dominance over the masses. The apparatus of modern systems of mass education, often inherited from colonial rulers, has been just one instrument in such campaigns of state legitimation. This book presents analyses of a range of contemporary projects of citizenship formation across Asia in order to identify those issues and concerns most central to Asian debates over the construction of modern identities. Its main focus is on schooling, but also examines other vehicles for citizenship-formation, such as museums and the internet; the role of religion (in particular Islam) in debates over citizenship and identity in certain Asian societies; and the relationship between state-centred identity discourses and the experience of increasingly 'globalized' elites"-- Provided by publisher.

Structural changes in banking have created space for new players on the financial markets. Weak economic growth, regulation, search for yield and technical innovations have facilitated growth in shadow banking. Even though the diversification of funding channels is to be welcomed, the growth of shadow banking entails risks that must be monitored. In Finland, the volume of shadow banking is small by international comparison..
