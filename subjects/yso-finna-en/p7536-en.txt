Finland's financial system is, by structure, vulnerable to risks associated with lending for house purchase. Housing loan volumes are large relative to other lending by banks and requirements on banks' own funds. The fact that household debt levels have increased and that housing wealth constitutes a large proportion of household assets also increases the vulnerabilities. In addition, covered bonds secured by housing loans play a significant role in bank funding and investment. However, the increase in vulnerabilities has largely levelled off in the 2010s..
Only a successful implementation of an overall reform program will enable Russian banks to provide financial intermediation and assist in the country's development from a nascent market economy to a mature financial system.The chances for reform are better now than at any time during the last decade.Favorable political and economic conditions and a change in attitude among bank management have created an unusual window of opportunity.The paper analyzes the past performance of the Russian banking industry, evaluates the reform agenda of the monetary authority, and argues for an overall reform program in order to seize the available opportunity. Key words: Russia, banking, reform .

The study looks at the effects of the introduction of the euro on the Estonian economy.A priori, introduction of the euro may affect the Estonian economy through several different channels.The study focuses mainly on Estonias foreign trade, banking system and capital flows.In short, it is not possible to discern any clear and definite effects of the euro at this point in time, although some emerging trends may be attributable to the introduction of the single currency and Estonias EU accession process.Estonia has become quite integrated with the EU, and this trend is expected to continue also in the future. Key words: Estonia, Economic and Monetary Union, foreign trade, capital flows .

The Russian financial markets are small for an economy the size of Russia, and in many respects underdeveloped. This restricts the Central Bank of Russia's scope for conducting monetary policy. In this paper we provide an overview of the Russian financial markets and the CBR's variegated collection of monetary policy tools and their effectiveness. The Russian monetary and exchange rate policy framework is currently in the process of change. During most of the 2000s, the CBR tightly steered the ruble's external value, which left little room for active monetary policy. After the 2008-2009 crisis, the bank began to loosen the reins of exchange rate management with the aim of moving gradually to a regime of inflation targeting. Since the monetary policy tools are still not highly effective, the big challenge for monetary authorities is improve the tools. Keywords: Russia, monetary policy, exchange rate policy .

"As financial markets expand and continue to refashion the world in their own image, the wealth of capitalist societies no longer presents itself, as it did to Karl Marx in the nineteenth century, as a "monstrous collection of commodities." Instead, it appears as an equally monstrous collection of financial securities, and the critique of political economy must proceed accordingly. But what would it mean to write Capital in the twenty-first century? Are we really to believe that risk, rather than labor, is now regarded as the true fount of economic value? Can it truly be the case that the credit relation--at least in the global North--has replaced the wage relation as the key site of exploitation and political struggle? And finally, if precarity is indeed the name of today's proletarian condition, what possible future does it actually portend, what analysis does it require? Through a series of creative substitutions, in Portfolio Society Ivan Ascher extends Marx's critical project in bold and unexpected ways. Ascher not only explains some of the often mystifying processes of contemporary finance, he also invites us to consider what becomes of capitalism itself in those places where the relation of capital to its own future is now mediated by financial markets. In the end, we may find that much has changed and much has not; relations of domination endure, and mystifications abound, but the devil is in the details, and that is where Ascher directs our attention. At once a critique of modern finance and of the societies under its spell, Portfolio Society succeeds in revealing the potential limits of Capital, while reveling still in its limitless potential." --
Contrary to most experience, Estonia (as well as Latvia and Lithuania) has been able to combine, for a number of years, fixed exchange rates, financial liberalisation (prior to proper supervision) and large current account deficits without inviting speculation using large capital flows as vehicles.The standard argument is that this must be due to exceptionally sound fundamentals and great policy credibility.Without challenging this argument either generally or for the case of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, this paper offers a supplementary perspective.These countries did not aim at developing a full-scale national economy with a full set of financial and other markets, as they had the possibility of joining an institutionally, culturally and geographically close set of North-Western European markets.Such a strategy goes further than having the goal of "rejoining Europe" as the external policy anchor.Having well-developed domestic markets can in some cases be substituted by accessing near-by markets, thus leaving little leeway to potentially unstable capital flows.This option, however, is not open to all, and it also has its downside. Key words: capital flows, exchange rate systems, institutional development, financial liberalisation, Baltic countries .

If loss in interbank confidence regarding banking sector balance sheets intensified the crisis in 2008, banks' faltering confidence in other banks' systems could cause the next crisis, experts warn. Confidence is vital to the financial system, and as account balances are situated in cyberspace, confidence in the numbers on the screen is of the utmost importance. From a practical point of view it is irrelevant whether a loss of confidence is due to the realisation of financial market risks or cyber risks..

To strengthen the stability of the system, the macroprudential toolkit available to the Finnish authorities should be brought to an internationally comparable level..

The financial markets of China
In the third quarter of 1998, Russia experienced what seemed a classical financial crisis, combining a currency crisis, a debt crisis and a banking crisis.The Russian crisis was also evidently connected with the earlier Asian crisis, and sent shock waves across global financial markets.Still, a closer look shows that the Russian crisis was mostly home made, typically caused by excessive public sector debt, and the mechanisms of crisis can not be understood without an understanding of the peculiarities of the Russian economic system, including demonetisation and insider ownership.Such factors also go a long way in explaining the emergence of Russia from the crisis.

Investment funds have emerged as significant financial intermediaries in Finland since the turn of the millennium. In this role, they supplement traditional deposit banking. However, from the perspective of financial stability, investment funds may also involve risks reminiscent of banking. One such key risk is if assets invested in funds are converted into significantly less liquid (less cash-convertible) form. Why can such liquidity transformation in a worst-case scenario pose a risk to financial stability, and how extensively is it performed among Finnish investment funds?.

Threats to the stability of the euro area financial system relate to the risks to global economic growth - such as uncertainties around developments in China - and to the international financial markets. The profitability of the euro area banking sector has improved from the weak level witnessed previously, but the large amount of non-performing loans continues to weigh on banks' balance sheets. Risks to the Finnish financial system are associated with the weakness of the economy and household debt. In order to contain potential overheating on the housing loan market and household indebtedness, the authorities will need new additions to their toolbox..

Household indebtedness is high in the Nordic countries. Housing loans are a significant part of banks' business, and covered bonds are important for banks both as sources of funding and as investments. The large size of the Nordic banking sector, its high degree of concentration and its interconnectedness with insurance companies increase the importance of housing market-related risks for the financial system and the economy as a whole. The materialisation of threats would increase losses in lending and investment activities and the cost of funding..

The financial sectors in the Baltic countries have developed quite rapidly over recent years and there are currently no immediate threats to their stability.However, the Baltic financial sectors are still below the level of development of the financial sectors in EU countries.The difference is remarkable both in the level of financing but also in the variety of instruments available in the markets.Even the banking sectors, which dominate the financing in the Baltic countries, are relatively small.The Baltic security markets are lagging behind the other EU accession countries and the development of that sector has been stagnant even during the recent period of growth.

China has experienced strong economic growth for over a quarter century.This brisk growth is expected to continue thanks to such factors as China's huge labour reserve, improvements in education levels, further integration of China into the global economy and a high savings rate, which provides China with strong potential for domestic investment.On the other hand, economic development is threatened by other trends, including widening inequality, the growing complexity of the decision-making framework and worsening of the public sector economy due to banking sector fragility and the absence of an adequate pension system.Keywords: China, economic development, growth .
Economic policy options in conditions of weak growth and low inflation
Russia : Virtual stabilization and real crisis
In 1997 the Russian economy seemed to have overcome inflation and to be poised for economic growth.But as it turned out there was little time to enjoy the fruits of financial stabilization, which was overturned by the 1998 crisis.Some reasons for inconsistencies in the Russian financial stabilization program are analysed here, as well as the conflict between the stability objective of monetary policy and the potentially inflationary budgetary policy that evolved in Russia in 1995-1997.Also discussed are certain trends in macroeconomic performance in 1996-1997 that raised the probability of a financial crisis. .
The 1998 financial meltdown brought to public attention the vulnerability of Russias banking sector, which was severely hit by the crisis.The Russian government and the CBR (Central Bank of Russia) acted in a timely manner in setting up a basic intervention plan for the rapid restoration of solvency.Unfortunately, these measures were not followed by a correction of the real problems behind the crisis.The Central Bank and the Russian government failed to exploit a unique chance to carry out significant reforms in the financial sector, leaving unresolved many of the flaws that afflicted Russian banks before the crisis.This paper reconstructs the events surrounding the Russian financial crisis and evaluates the subsequent rescue of the banking sector. .

Banking reform in Russia / Winds of change?
Financial crises and other serious financial disruptions may be caused by several different types of risks. Macroprudential policy, designed to prevent such crises, needs a more diversified set of tools than are available in Finland at present. Although the Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority already has access to a number of macroprudential instruments, there is reason for the toolkit to be supplemented. There is a need for instruments to ensure capital adequacy in the Finnish banking sector and, if necessary, prevent the housing market overheating..

The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing importance of banks in the Russian economy over the period following the financial crisis of 1998. We use several measures to assess the role of banks in domestic financial intermediation in Russia. The traditional macro-level view is complemented by the analysis of sectoral financial flows as well as by insights from micro-level studies. All of these confirm that banks are becoming increasingly important in financial intermediation. We find that the scope and efficiency of intermediation by Russian banks has improved over time, but the level of banks' financial intermediation still lags behind other countries with similar levels of income. Possible explanations for this include the dual nature of Russian financial system.  Keywords: Russia, banks, financial intermediation, financial system .

In the wake of the international financial crisis, authorities have been given new tools to prevent such crises. These tools - or macroprudential instruments - are intended to enhance banks' resilience to risk and prevent the excessive lending that often underlies asset price bubbles. In making decisions on deployment of the macroprudential tools, authorities will be supported by a set of early warning indicators confirmed by research data to best predict the outbreak of banking crises..

The countercyclical capital buffer requirement is one of the new macroprudential instruments that will come into use in Finland. It enables the strengthening of the banking sector's resilience to systemic risks resulting from excessive credit growth. In setting the requirement, strong emphasis should be placed on a small range of indicators to be selected, defined and published in advance. In contrast, reducing or releasing the buffer should primarily be based on judgment by the relevant authorities..

Managing risks in the European periphery debt crisis : lessons from the trade-off between economics, politics and the financial markets
This article examines the theory of economic reform in light of the actual experience Poland.Its main themes are liberalisation and stabilisation.Liberalisation in the case of transition economies implies decontrol of domestic prices and foreign trade. Liberalization may be gradual (gradualism), or immediate (shock therapy).Here, we compare the effects of these strategies using Swedar van Wijnbergen's intertemporal speculation model, taking into account the question of currency convertibility.  According to monetarist theory, budget deficits are the main cause of inflation in closed economies.Thus, stabilisation programs usually start with budget balancing.Implementation of nominal anchors for economic reform is also an important issue, because nominal anchors can help eliminate demand pressure and build credibility.Three nominal anchors, i.e. wage tax, fixed exchange rate and high interest rate are closely examined.In addition, the non-trivial task of sequencing the phases of reform is discussed. Obviously, an unsuccessful stabilisation has a strong influence on, e.g. real exchange rates and export opportunities, so how does one time the phases of reform for successful results?  Poland's "Big Bang" reform is an example of a monetarist economic reform.This analysis covers the main features of the reform, applying the credit market model of Guillermo Calvo and Fabrizio Coricelli.Calvo and Coricelli have studied the influence of tight credit on output from their empirical results, which is of particular interest in discussion of the Polish case.The paper ends with a summary of the reform outcomes to date.  Keywords: Poland, liberalisation, stabilisation, credit market .

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine and analyze the financial markets of China. The intention was to form a comprehensive picture of the current state and the latest developments of the markets. Specific attention was paid to the accessibility and opportunities offered to foreign participants in the markets. The study concentrates on mainland China, excluding Hong Kong and Macau. The research was conducted using qualitative methodology, by collecting data first and then analyzing it using financial market theories. The data was collected from various sources, including business news, academic journals, official websites, statistics databases and interviews. The analysis was based on different aspects of efficient markets; the allocative, operational and informational efficiencies. The results revealed that while the financial markets of China have a modern and quickly developing appearance, they are still far from being open and efficient. The most important limiting factor in the financial markets is the regulation of the foreign exchange market. The government also holds a strong control over all the other aspects of the markets as well. The access for foreign companies is currently restricted; only a limited number of licensed foreign institutions are allowed to operate with the local currency, and even then only within set quotas. The markets are, however, constantly developing. The foreign exchange is slowly opening up, presenting new investment opportunities for foreign investors in the future.

On risk prediction
Inflation swaps are financial instruments used for the purpose of hedging against future inflation. Inflation expectations extracted from inflation swaps are often used as a measure of the market's inflation expectations, but the evolution of the swaps does not always correspond to actual changes in inflation expectations. When the market's expectations are assessed on the basis of inflation swaps, it is important to pay attention to the specific features of these agreements. Consequently, in assessing changes in short-term inflation expectations, forward inflation (e.g. annual inflation one year ahead) should be used rather than inflation swap rates..
Financial markets and institutions : a european perspective
Against the backdrop of the international financial and economic crisis, this paper seeks to identify financial vulnerabilities in Emerging Europe. Data are presented for 20 countries using a 'balance-sheet' framework to disaggregate financial weaknesses within each economy. First, financial flow imbalances and general macroeconomic weaknesses are identified, leading to a discussion of the financial stock imbalances that were caused by these persistent flow imbalances. The paper concludes with an assessment of which countries are most vulnerable to any potential 'sudden-stop' of financial flows to the region.   Key words: financial crisis, balance-sheets, emerging economies, Emerging Europe .

Saving the market from capitalism : ideas for an alternative finance
Structural changes in banking have created space for new players on the financial markets. Weak economic growth, regulation, search for yield and technical innovations have facilitated growth in shadow banking. Even though the diversification of funding channels is to be welcomed, the growth of shadow banking entails risks that must be monitored. In Finland, the volume of shadow banking is small by international comparison..
An overheating of the international financial markets would spread to Finland, too, pushing up asset prices and possibly boosting the supply of loans. From a macroprudential perspective, strong growth in both these indicators would increase domestic vulnerabilities. The financial crisis has increased the understanding of cross-border stability risks, but the tools for mitigating these risks remain insufficient..
