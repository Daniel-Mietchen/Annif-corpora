Ecology : principles and applications
Linking the natural environment and the economy : essays from the eco-eco group
"We have spent the last two centuries building a civilization on coal and the last century building it bigger still on oil. Fossil fuels have been the wellspring of our complex, glorious modern world, but they are about to run out. By the end of the 21st century, our oil and natural gas supplies will be virtually nonexistent, and limited coal supplies will be restricted to only a handful of countries. Environmental scientist Steve Hallett and veteran journalist John Wright make abundantly clear that we are at the crest of a remarkable two-hundred-year glitch in the history of civilization and are about to embark on the decline. Experts may argue about whether peak oil production has already arrived or will come in a decade or two, but in any case, as Hallett and Wright show, we must plan for a future without reliance on oil. But successful planning depends on a realistic assessment of the facts about our current situation. To that end, they describe how the petroleum interval of the last century, on which our civilization is based, fits in to the larger history of civilization. They describe the fate of civilizations and empires of the past that have come and gone based on their vital connection with the environment. Turning to an even longer timeframe, the authors make a compelling case that the key determinant of our global economy is not so much the invisible hand of the marketplace but the inexorable laws of ecology. When it comes to the long term, nature will impose limits beyond which our economy cannot go. Despite increased emphasis on renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources, our current obsession with growth is ultimately unsustainable. The authors foresee the coming decades as a time of much disruption and change of lifestyle, but in the end we may learn a wiser, more sustainable stewardship of our natural resources. This timely, sobering, yet constructive discussion of energy and ecology offers a realistic vision of the near future and many important lessons about the limits of our resources".

This book provides a state-of-the-art perspective on industrial biorenewables. A selection of industries dealing with biomass as raw materials present their activities and industrial processes. Emphasis on each chapter includes, and is not limited to: discussion of the motivation of that specific industry to use biorenewables; a short history of their expertise and developments in the field; selected current R&D activities using biomass, the aim of the research, type of biomass used, catalysts, achieved products, economics, etc.; detailed discussions of the type of biomass, indicating 1st or 2nd generation, and options to substitute 1st generation raw materials for more sustainable 2nd generation ones; current processes that have been or are about to be implemented at industrial and commercial scales; expectations such as where potential improvements could be made and where academic research groups could help provide pre-competitive and industrially-sound insights and research; and finally, conclusions, prospects, and recommendations for future directions of research.

Birch consumption by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Finnish Lapland
Abstract: A method for estimating the consumption of birch leaves by browsing herbivores is presented. In 170 study plots in northern Lapland, the mean consumption was 1150 g dry leaves per hectare up to the middle of the summer. The consumption per plot was dependent on the forest type, amount of root shoots and altitude. The grazing on birch continued in late summer. The annual birch consumption by an individual reindeer is of the order of 25 kg dry matter. As a consumer of the birch, the reindeer is less important than invertebrates.

Whole earth discipline : an ecopragmatist manifesto
Sperling and Gordon outline the problem in full and assign blame squarely where it belongs--on the auto-industry, short-sighted government policies, and consumers. They consider the issue from all angles and take up such topics as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture, breaking Detroit's hold on energy and climate policy, the search for low-carbon fuels, California's pioneering role, and more. --  Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveler behavior, they suggest, offer us a way out of our predicament. -- Ultimately, the authors contend that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems, California and China, are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues

"Governments across the world are concerned about the future of world order. This original, timely and innovative collection is the first to consider the interconnections between energy, capitalism and the future of world order from the angle of critical political economy. In its wide-ranging chapters, the authors analyze these interlocking topics from three closely assoicated perspectives: energy, capitalism and international theory; energy capitalism and the making of world order; and energy and capitalism in the 21st century. The first section includes important examinations of energy and capitalism, the international trade system and the threat of peak oil to liberalism. The second offers pioneering chapters on petroleum and development in the global south, US-Canadian energy relations and the politics of transitioning to a post-carbon era in the age of climate change. Finally, the book concludes by exploring key new and worrying developments such as the revolution in biofuels, the excavation of Canadian tar sands and the rise of hydraulic fracturing"--Back cover.
