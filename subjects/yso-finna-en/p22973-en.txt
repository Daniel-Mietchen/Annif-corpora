The purpose of this thesis work was to research the possibilities to launch and sell a new bag product. The bag product must fulfill the demands of the ongoing megatrends in the world. The significant megatrends regarding the new bag product are climate change, sustainability, resource scarcity and demographic change.     A customer survey was made to research customers' behavior of using different kinds of bags while running errands. The customers' general opinion of different kinds of bags and their good properties was researched in the survey.  The price that the customers' are willing to pay for different kinds of bags was also researched.     From the results of the survey, it was found out that plastic bags are used a great deal and in many cases every time when running errands, even though the opinion of the respondent about a plastic bag would not be very positive. Whereas none of the participants of the survey claimed to use a paper bag every time when running errands. Paper bag seem to have a reputation to be weak, not to withstand rain and to be inconvenient to transport. It was also found out from the survey that people are willing to pay the same amount for a plastic bag as for a paper bag. That amount is more than the price of a plastic bag and less than a paper bag. The respondents were willing to pay more for a luxury bag product.
