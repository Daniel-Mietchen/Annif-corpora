The Achilles tendon is the strongest and largest of human tendons, and its proper function is essential for normal gait. Most acute Achilles tendon injuries occur during sports, particularly in ball games. The purposes of this study were (1) to examine the incidence of total Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) over a 33-year period in the city of Oulu and to investigate its changes with respect to age, sex, and injury mechanism. (2) to compare ≥10-year outcomes of two postoperative regimens after ATR repair: early weightbearing with early mobilization versus early weightbearing with early immobilization in tension, (3) to compare clinical outcome and calf muscle strength recovery after conservative treatment or open surgical repair of acute ATR, followed by identical accelerated rehabilitation programs. The overall incidence per 100 000 person years increased from 2.1 in 1979 to 21.5 in 2011. The incidence increased in all age groups. The incidence of sports-related ruptures increased during the second 11-year period, whereas the incidence of non-sports-related ruptures increased steadily over the entire study period. Early mobilization and immobilization in tension after ATR repair resulted in similar clinical outcomes and isokinetic strengths. Regardless of patient satisfaction with the operative treatment, calf muscle strength did not recover normally, even at the 10-year follow-up. Surgery and conservative treatment of acute ATR resulted in similar Achilles tendon performance score after 18 months, but surgery restored calf muscle strength earlier. Surgery also resulted in better health-related quality of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain. Conservative treatment with a functional protocol is recommended for a large majority of patients. However, patients with high physical expectations could still benefit from operative treatment. In conclusion, the incidence of ATR is rising, postoperative immobilization and early mobilization result in similar long-term results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score and calf muscle function, and conservative treatment with a functional protocol is the preferred treatment for the majority of patients.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children <15 years of age at the time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) at Oulu University Hospital over a period of 33 years (1982−2014) and throughout Finland in 2002−2005. The aim was to assess the effect of certain host characteristics (age at diagnosis, family history of T1D, T1D-associated HLA risk genotypes and participation in T1D prediction and prevention trials) on the frequency on DKA. A further aim was to assess temporal changes in the frequency of DKA.The overall frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of T1D in children <15 years was low both at Oulu University Hospital and over the whole country. A decrease in the frequency of DKA was observed at the university hospital during the years 1982−2001, but it then seemed to stabilize at just under 20.0%. The frequency in the whole of Finland during the period 2002−2005 was similar, i.e. 19.4%.The frequency of DKA at diagnosis in very young children (<2 years of age) at Oulu University Hospital decreased markedly during the period in question, being 50.0% in 1982−1991, 39.1% in 1992−2001 and 17.1% in 2002−2014 (p=0.021), and a similar decrease was seen in children <5 years (32.1% in 1982−1991, 17.7% in 1992−2001 and 13.0% in 2002−2014, p=0.007). The children aged 10−14.9 years at diagnosis, however, had an increased risk of DKA over the whole period studied here, and more attention should definitely be paid to this group in the future to reduce its DKA frequency.In the analysis of the data based on all children in Finland diagnosed with T1D in 2002−2005 the risk of DKA at diagnosis was lower in those with a first-degree relative affected by T1D. The children carrying a higher HLA-conferred risk of T1D had DKA less frequently at the manifestation of the disease.Prospective studies based on screening for HLA-DQB1-associated genetic susceptibility to T1D from cord blood and subsequent regular clinical, immunological and metabolic follow-up have been going on in Oulu University Hospital since 1995, and the children taking part have been found to have a reduced frequency of DKA (5%) at diagnosis. Genetic screening without follow-up did not prevent DKA at disease presentation.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system leading to neurological disability in young adults. Finland belongs to the high-risk areas of MS with continuously increasing of prevalence rates. In comparison to the general population, patients with MS have an increased risk of premature mortality. The extent of comorbidity rates and their role in the outcomes of MS have not been fully investigated. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the epidemiology and survival of MS in Northern Ostrobothnia. The neurological comorbidity and frequency of fractures in patients with MS were also investigated. All MS patients diagnosed in Oulu University Hospital during 1990–2010 were included in this study. The prevalence of MS was 103/105; the mean overall incidence was 6.3/105. Women had a 2.3-fold higher MS incidence than men. The overall incidence figures were clearly affected by a pronounced increase among females. Neurological comorbidities were common in MS patients with 17.1 % of patients suffering from some other neurological diseases in addition with MS. The most common diseases were migraine (10.4 %) and epilepsy (4.7 %). The prevalence of stroke was similar in MS patients compared to the general population, but the 21-year survival rate was significantly lower in MS patients who had suffered a stroke compared with those MS patients without stroke. MS patients experienced a high risk for fragility fractures especially vertebral fractures. The possibility of osteoporosis had been examined only 26 % patients with fragility fractures and osteoporosis was detected in the majority. The prevalence of MS in our cohort was similar to the Finnish average, but in the Seinäjoki area, the prevalence was double the national average. Although the increasing incidence of female MS has been confirmed also in other studies, the reasons for this phenomenon are unknown. The increased risk for fragility fractures may be associated with low D vitamin levels or pathogenesis of MS. These findings emphasize the role of comorbid diseases in disability and survival of MS patients and attention should be paid to these conditions also in clinical practice.
