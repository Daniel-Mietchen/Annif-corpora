telemedicine
For the past few decades, technology has been touted as the cure for all of healthcare's ills, yet medicine stubbornly resisted computerization-- until now. Thanks largely to billions of dollars in federal incentives, healthcare has finally gone digital. Wachter examines healthcare at the dawn of its computer age, and shows how technology is changing care at the bedside. He questions whether government intervention has been useful or destructive-- and does so with clarity, insight, humor, and compassion.

This book is about the ways digital technology can contribute to the welfare of older people. The Internet, mobile phones and other technologies have changed how we live and work. Such technologies also shape how services for older people are organised in ways that potentially place carers and older people at the centre of service provision. Telecare can make homes 'smart' so that they are more comfortable and less risky for people who can take advantage of devices that help make them independent members of their community. Digital Welfare is part of the broader project in Britain and elsewhere to adopt new information and communications technologies (ICTs) to organise and deliver health and social welfare services. This includes mundane technologies like an alarm to call for help to complex telecare 'smart homes' and electronic patient records. The intended and unintended consequences of such new technologies must be explored if we are to benefit from these innovations. Based on recent research, this book seeks to highlight and examine the new opportunities and dilemmas that confront older people and all those concerned with their welfare in the network society. This edited collection provides original contributions from leading academics and researchers in the field to access the evidence for improved professional integration and user-centred health and social care services for older people arising from health informatics.

Abstract: It is important to bring medical help to those living in West Africa. A good way to do this is by telemedicine. Telemedicine, although it uses power, can be achieved easily with solar panels, and the best solar panels are monocrystalline and cadmium telluride. Using graphical scenarios, statistical derivations, theoretical ideologies acquired from literature reviews, usability ideas and two personal case scenarios, the objective of this project was achieved. Criteria like cost, temperature coefficient, and sustainability can be used as weighing factors in determining the suitability of a solar panel. This study recommends interfacing a telemedicine took-kit with a hand-held tablet PC, and supporting the combination with a power module for both solar energy and battery to improve ergonomics, to decrease the number of power outages and to solve wire management problems. This study suggests collaborations between government and technology-led societies provide investment leverage for the development of sustainable telemedicine platforms for West Africa, while more research in efficient power systems will be considered an added advantage to this process. Finally, health workers, energy engineers, research students, investors and especially those who are passionate about West Africa ́s technological processes will find this study very resourceful.

"EHealth is a catalyst for innovating and redesigning health care. The use of information and communication technology in health care creates opportunities for patient-centered care and for the transition of medicine into new models for safe care and self-management. eHealth has the potential to revitalize the fragmented health care system and to make health and well-being achievable for all. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that the benefits of eHealth are gradually being realized in terms of effectiveness, efficacy and satisfaction. Nonetheless, the success for eHealth depends on the maturity of an organization to implement it, and on the adoption by policy makers, health care professionals and patients." -- Preface.
