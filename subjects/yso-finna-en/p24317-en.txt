landscape ecology
Landscape ecology of a stressed environment
All over the world, efforts are being made to preserve landscapes facing fundamental change as a consequence of widespread agricultural intensification, land abandonment and urbanisation. The 'cultural' and 'resilience' approaches have, until now, largely been viewed as distinct methods for understanding the effects of these dynamics, and the ways in which they might be adapted or managed.

Abstract.
Garden Revolution shows how an ecological approach to planting can lead to beautiful gardens that buck much of conventional gardening's counter-productive, time-consuming practices. Instead of picking the wrong plant and then constantly tilling, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing, Larry Weaner advocates for choosing plants that are adapted to the soil and climate of a specific site and letting them naturally evolve over time.

"What insights can an anthropologist gain from the day-to-day use of parks? How does an economist view the supply and demand of an outdoor space? Why would an architect divide landscape into 'cultural' and 'natural' elements? Experts from around the world give their thoughts on how disciplines outside landscape architecture view the profession. Their insights link together theories from outside the area, giving constructive feedback on the lessons they gain from work in the environment and what they can contribute back to the subject. The book is an important addition to the literature on landscape architecture and provides a valuable companion to landscape theory modules for undergraduate and postgraduate students"--

Landscape ecology
In its first English-language edition, this book introduces the many-faceted interactions of animal populations with their habitats. From soil fauna, ants and termites to small and large herbivores, burrowing mammals and birds, the author presents a comprehensive analysis of animals and ecosystems that is as broad and varied as all nature. Chapter 2 addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems, emphasizing fluxes of energy and matter within and between ecosystems, and the effects of animals on qualitative and structural habitat change. Discussion includes chapters on the ro.

"This official reference guide to the Sustainable Sites Initiative Rating System contains information on principles, strategies, technologies, tools, and best practices for sustainable site design applicable to any type of designed landscape, with or without buildings, ranging from shopping malls, streetscapes, subdivisions, corporate and academic campuses, transportation corridors, parks and recreation areas, all the way to single family homes. Equally useful as a guide to achieving SSI credits, or as a guide to independent pursuit of sustainable sites, it offers in-depth coverage on important "green" topics"--
