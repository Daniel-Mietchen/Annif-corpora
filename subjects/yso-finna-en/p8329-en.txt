Should the frequency of drought increase in boreal forests due to climate change, seedlings planted in prepared peat mounds could become more susceptible to soil desiccation. The resistance of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings to drought will thus be a key factor in the regeneration success of pine-dominated, forestry-drained peatlands. In this study, we evaluated the physiological, metabolic, and morphologi¬cal responses of year-old seedlings gradually exposed to extreme drought in highly decomposed Sphagnum-Carex peat blocks. Drought clearly suppressed root and shoot growth as well as fractional colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Sustained declines in photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of previous-year and current-year needles did not occur until the volumetric soil water content had dropped to 30% and 10%, respectively. Polyamine analysis revealed that new needles are preferred in protecting the different parts of the seedlings against drought stress. Despite growth losses, the maintenance of rather high photochemical efficiency in current-year needles under severe water stress would appear to indicate a potential for seedling recovery if water availability in the peat improved. Given the high tolerance exhibited by Scots pine seedlings, death by drought seems a lesser concern.

The topic of this thesis was offered by Mypose Oy, a startup company based in Oulu, Finland. Their primary products are impressive photo machines, which can be utilized by businesses to transform customers into brand ambassadors in social media. As the company has been expanding its business, there was a requirement to improve their analytics system, so that statistical insights of marketing campaigns using Mypose machines would be delivered to customer quickly and punctually. The thesis was divided into two distinct parts, in which the first one focused on the fundamental concepts of social media and social marketing, as well as the methods to identify, collect and aggregate metrics on social networks in order to calculate useful key performance indicators (KPIs). It also included studies about the values of email in modern marketing strategies, and methods to measure email effectiveness. The second part involved designing a new analytics system. It included examining different flows of Mypose photos to identify possible metrics, and determining proper methods to collect and compute KPIs based on accumulated statistical values. Additionally, a brief database modification and user interface designs for the new system were also discussed. The final result was the prototype of a new analytics system that was rich of functionalities, comprehensively visualized and easy to extend. Various parts of the outcome were developed and functioned in production during the course of writing this thesis. It also exposed some concerns about further development of the system.

"Positive Organizational Scholarship" is a book that helps establish a new field of study in the organizational sciences. It examines a variety of positive dynamics in organizations that give rise to extraordinary outcomes, often described by words, such as excellence, thriving, flourishing, abundance, vitality, and resilience. POS has a bias toward life-giving, generative, and ennobling human phenomena. It represents a value perspective based on ideas of "goodness" and positive human potential. POS is distinguished from traditional organizational studies in that it seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition, and it does so in rigorous ways, based on scholarly research and theory. Chapters in this volume will serve as the key reference material for those interested in understanding exceptional, virtuous, life-giving, and flourishing individual and organizational behavior.

The development of large-scale agricultural mechanization required to sustain food production, combined with limited conventional fuel resources, spurs on to better assess the time and energy investments required for commodities production. The proposed analysis is based on the description of field working dynamics collected on an experimental tractor during a plowing operation. The energy needs can there be characterized as having a dual alternating profile, depending on the tractor working phase within the field. As a result, two field oriented performance indicators consisting in time efficiency [h.ha-1] and area specific consumption [l.ha-1] are defined out of the profile characteristics. A model converting the draft of an implement into an engine running point is then developed to compute these indicators. The model is fitted on data collected over conventional bench tests, and is validated by an application to a plowing operation. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis on the operational parameters is conducted.

We test the informational efficiency of the three Baltic stock exchanges.It was found that the price indices used in testing are not even weak-form efficient, ie past returns can be used to predict future returns.It was also found that the time series of daily returns clearly exhibit autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. We also test Granger causality amongst the Baltic stock exchanges and from three stock exchanges outside the region.Outside the region only US market seems to affect prices in the Baltic stock exchanges.Inside the region Tallinn and Riga stock exchanges have clear effects on Lithuanian stock market, but Lithuanian market does not affect the other two. Keywords: Baltic countries, stock markets, efficiency .

The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing importance of banks in the Russian economy over the period following the financial crisis of 1998. We use several measures to assess the role of banks in domestic financial intermediation in Russia. The traditional macro-level view is complemented by the analysis of sectoral financial flows as well as by insights from micro-level studies. All of these confirm that banks are becoming increasingly important in financial intermediation. We find that the scope and efficiency of intermediation by Russian banks has improved over time, but the level of banks' financial intermediation still lags behind other countries with similar levels of income. Possible explanations for this include the dual nature of Russian financial system.  Keywords: Russia, banks, financial intermediation, financial system .

The purpose of this thesis was to study, how much energy is used in pumping fluids in each auxiliary system of marine main engine and to choose the system that is the most energy consuming. After choosing one system for closer observation the target was to study how pumping energy efficiency of that specific auxiliary system can be improved by changing the design, but still keeping the original technical limits for the system valid. 9L46 marine main engine was chosen as a reference engine for all calculations and all the component data for each part and unit of different manufacturer was obtained from the TERPS database in Wärtsilä Ship power's intranet page. Based on the calculated results a ballpark economical estimate of investment difference between a normal system and an energy efficient system was made.

Abstract: Management consulting. Management consulting has long roots that reach all the way to the 19th century. First known as efficiency experts, they worked to improve efficiency on the shop floor level. Quite soon after, management consulting started to evolve in to a industry challenging the traditional industries. Today, the main purpose of management consultancies is to study and analyze the structure and functioning of a company as a whole or part of its segments and to find opportunities and strategies to improve the company's efficiency in the management level. The thesis aims to illustrate how management consulting has evolved over the years, how do the client and consultant communicate with each other, how to make consulting engagements as successful as possible and what problems might rise when dealing with management consultancies. The study was carried out by analyzing a number of different literature sources and by assembling the information into a form that would allow the reader to look directly into the client-consultant interaction. All the presented information aims to help the understanding of management consulting and the practical issues revolving around it.
