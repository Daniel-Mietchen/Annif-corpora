Abstract: The main purpose of the thesis project was to build an application that has a reservation system by accessing distributed databases remotely. There are many parts of the world where the ICT technologies are growing at a higher rate than the medical and transportation infrastructures. The electronic pharmacy application is intended to take advantage of this reality by accessing inventory databases of pharmacies from allover the world via web service and make medicine reservation from a pharmacy located nearest to the patient.    The application was made by Microsoft tools and programming frameworks. Never the less, the thesis study includes the general structure of using web service and how database can be accessed and manipulated remotely. It consists of; authentication of users with different roles, manipulation of data, reservation system and mapping of locations.    As companies implementation of databases increases, the use of service oriented applications that use these databases remotely also increases. Web services are the standard for building service oriented applications. Building a web service requires choosing the right type of bindings based on the connection types to choose, hosting the service on the right type of environment, setting the address that exposes the service and considering security issues.

Institutional repositories remain key to data storage on campus, fulfilling the academic needs of various stakeholders. Demystifying the Institutional Repository for Success is a practical guide to creating and sustaining an institutional repository through marketing, partnering, and understanding the academic needs of all stakeholders on campus. This title is divided into seven chapters, covering: traditional scholarly communication and open access publishing; the academic shift towards open access; what the successful institutional repository looks like; institutional repository collaborations and building campus relationships; building internal and external campus institutional repository relationships; the impact and value proposition of institutional repositories; and looking ahead to open access opportunities.

The free exchange of microbial genetic information is an established public good, facilitating research on medicines, agriculture, and climate change. However, over the past quarter-century, access to genetic resources has been hindered by intellectual property claims from developed countries under the World Trade Organization's TRIPS Agreement (1994) and by claims of sovereign rights from developing countries under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (1992). In this volume, the authors examine the scientific community's responses to these obstacles and advise policymakers on how to harness provisions of the Nagoya Protocol (2010) that allow multilateral measures to support research. By pooling microbial materials, data, and literature in a carefully designed transnational e-infrastructure, the scientific community can facilitate access to essential research assets while simultaneously reinforcing the open access movement. The original empirical surveys of responses to the CBD included here provide a valuable addition to the literature on governing scientific knowledge commons.
Optical Code Division Multiple Access : A Practical Perspective
Intelligent medium access control for the future wireless networks
The evolution of broadband access networks toward bimodal fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks, described in this book, may be viewed as the endgame of broadband access. After discussing the economic impact of broadband access and current worldwide deployment statistics, all the major legacy wireline and wireless broadband access technologies are reviewed. State-of-the-art GPON and EPON fiber access networks are described, including their migration to next-generation systems such as OCDMA and OFDMA PONs. The latest developments of wireless access networks are covered, including VHT WLAN, Gigabit WiMAX, LTE and WMN. The advantages of FiWi access networks are demonstrated by applying powerful network coding, heterogeneous optical and wireless protection, hierarchical frame aggregation, hybrid routing and QoS continuity techniques across the optical-wireless interface. The book is an essential reference for anyone working on optical fiber access networks, wireless access networks or converged FiWi systems.

A comprehensive guide to optical fiber communications, from the basic principles to the latest developments in OCDMA for Next-Generation Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) systems. Part I starts off with the fundamentals of light propagation in optical fibers, including multiple access protocols, and their enabling techniques. Part II is dedicated to the practical perspectives of Next-Generation Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology. It covers the key building blocks of OCDMA, devices such as optical encoders and decoders, signal impairments due to noise, and data confidentiality, a unique property of OCDMA. This is followed by hybrid system architectures with TDM and WDM and practical aspects such as system cost, energy efficiency and long-reach PONs. Featuring the latest research, with cutting-edge coverage of system design, optical implementations, and experimental demonstrations in test beds, this text is ideal for students, researchers and practitioners in the industry seeking to obtain an up-to-date understanding of optical communication networks.

This paper is based on a session “How to make forest science available for all? Publishers', editors', and authors' challenges” at the IUFRO XXIV world conference, organized by Pekka Nygren and Eeva Korpilahti from the Finnish Society of Forest Science. The presenters dealt with the topical problems of publishing scientific knowledge from different perspectives. The talks covered the development of journals, publications and submissions, benefits and drawbacks of open access publishing as well as electronic and traditional publishing, and possibilities to promote interesting papers either from the journal's or from the author's perspective, and the problems of disseminating the scientific results to the end users. In this paper, a few prevalent viewpoints, inspired by the session, are raised and discussed with some suggestions included.
