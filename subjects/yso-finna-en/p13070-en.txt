The quality demands for SC paper have increased due to the creation of polymer covered multinip calenders which have made it possible to reach even better roughness and gloss values. However, the intensified calendering conditions have made calender blackening a limiting factor in production. The precise reasons for calender blackening are still unknown, but several earlier studies have given the reason to believe that calender blackening is a cause of several different factors.  The target of this final thesis was to study whether the bleaching of kraft pulp has any effect on calender blackening. The hypothesis for this work was that decreasing the bleaching of pulp, decreases calender blackening. In the literary part the previous studies about calender blackening were researched. Also theories and studies about hydrogen peroxide bleaching, the properties of SC paper, the optical properties of paper and theories about calendering were studied. In the empirical part softwood kraft pulp was bleached with hydrogen peroxide into three brightnesses (74%, 86% and 89%) and were mixed in two different ratios (85/15 and 70/30) with thermomechanical pulp. Approximately 25 laboratory sheets were created from each pulp mixture and calendered with three different calendering levels by changing the linear load and temperature of the calender. The connection between kraft pulp bleaching and calender blackening was studied via the light absorption and light scattering coefficients. Several studies have come to the conclusion that calender blackening is caused by the local decrease of the light scattering coefficient. Based on the results of the empirical studies no clear connection between kraft pulp bleaching and calender blackening could be found. However, this final thesis confirmed several earlier theories. For example, increasing the share of kraft pulp and calendering intensity as well as decreasing the light scattering, all increased calender blackening. The validity of the results is reliable with certain reservations due to the differences in light scattering, brightness and grammage. Only one pulp should have been used to produce the laboratory sheets, because the diffeences in the kappa number might have influenced the results. Also the effect of the brightness of TMP should have been studied by using two different brightness levels instead of one (78%). Relying on earlier studies, the effect of formation on calender blackening should have been studied also.
