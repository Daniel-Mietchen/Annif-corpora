Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest joint disease in the world, and it has a major socioeconomic impact. OA causes progressive degenerative changes in the composition and structure of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Clinical diagnosis of OA is based on physical examination and qualitative evaluation of changes on plain radiographs. Current clinical imaging methods are subjective or insensitive to early OA changes. Therefore, new methods are needed so as to quantify composition of the cartilage and characteristics of the subchondral bone. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of clinically applicable X-ray-based methods for the assessment of the cartilage proteoglycan content as well as the structure and density of subchondral bone in a knee joint.Subchondral bone density and structure (local binary patterns, Laplacian, and fractal-based algorithms) analysis methods for two-dimensional (2-D) plain radiographs were validated against three-dimensional (3-D) bone microarchitecture obtained from micro-computed tomography ex vivo and applied to plain radiographs in vivo. Furthermore, a method developed for the evaluation of articular cartilage proteoglycan content from computed tomography (CT) was validated against a delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), which is widely used as a proteoglycan sensitive method, in subjects referred for an arthroscopy of the knee joint.Subchondral bone density and structure evaluated from 2-D radiographs were significantly related to the bone volume fraction and true 3-D microarchitecture of bone, respectively. In addition, bone density- and structure-related parameters from radiographs were significantly different among subjects with different stages of OA. Cartilage proteoglycan content evaluated from CT was significantly related to dGEMRIC method. Furthermore, dGEMRIC was associated with bone structure from a 2-D radiograph.In conclusion, analysis of bone structure and density is feasible from clinically available 2-D radiographs. A novel CT method sensitive to proteoglycan content should be considered when a 3-D view of cartilage quality is needed.
Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of immature and mature articular cartilage
Cartilage-related diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) are a major cause of disability and decrease in the quality of life. Moreover OA causes a heavy economical burden on the social welfare and health care systems. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides accurate noninvasive method of morphological evaluation of the articular cartilage. However, there are early degenerative changes in the articular cartilage that can be evaluated with modern quantitative MRI methods prior to the signs of cartilage loss. In this study, T2 relaxation time of the articular cartilage was further evaluated in 1.5T in vivo using clinical patients and asymptomatic volunteers. The detection of focal patellar cartilage lesions in T2 mapping as compared to standard clinical MRI was evaluated. T2 mapping showed more lesions than the clinical MRI, and in T2 maps the lesions appeared generally wider. This suggests that T2-mapping is feasible in the clinical setting and may reveal cartilage lesions not seen in the standard knee MRI. The normal topographical variation of T2 relaxation time of articular cartilage in different compartments of the knee joint and at different zones of cartilage in young healthy adults was assessed. T2 values were significantly higher in the superficial zone as compared to the deep tissue at all locations and there was remarkable variation in T2 relaxation between different locations. The normal variation in cartilage T2 within a joint is significant and should be acknowledged when pathology-related T2 changes are investigated. The short- and long-term repeatability of T2 relaxation time measurements of articular cartilage in the knee joint was assessed. The results showed mostly good repeatability, and with careful patient positioning T2 relaxation time at the different cartilage surfaces of the knee can be accurately determined.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic condition that reduces the quality of life of millions of individuals worldwilde. In OA, the progressive degradation of articular cartilage (AC) and bone can cause joint pain and disability. Currently there is no effective treatment available for OA besides gross joint replacement surgery. This is largely due to the lack of accurate biomarkers to test potential drugs and treatments that could stop or reverse the disease progression. The primary tools in use for OA diagnostics are inadequate in the early stage of the disease and merely allow its late manifestations to be visualized. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) has demonstrated the ability to distinguish degenerated from intact AC prior to radiographic changes. Moreover, so-colled rotating frame relaxation time parameters are sensitive to the slow molecular motion domain, relevant for clinical applications. T1ρ and T2ρ relaxation time measurements using adiabatic spin-lock pulses (AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ) have shown superior sensitivity to cartilage degeneration in vitro over conventional qMRI parameters. This thesis aimed to compare the differences that exist between established qMRI methods for AC against arthroscopic evaluation as well as optimize and validate AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ mapping of cartilage in vivo.The findings showed that T1 and T2 relaxation time and delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) were able to discriminate among different arthroscopic grades of cartilage lesions. However, arthroscopic findings and qMRI parameters were not correlated, supporting the viewpoint that qMRI may be able to elicit more comprehensive information on the quality of remaining cartilage tissue as compared to diagnostic arthroscopy, which detects cartilage loss.AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ mapping of cartilage in vivo were successfully implemented and validated on a clinical MRI system. AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ were able to overcome limitations of the existing methods (continuous wave spin-lock approach), which are challenging to implement on clinical settings for their susceptibility to field inhomogeneity and relatively high power deposition in tissue. The association of AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ with cartilage and bone marrow lesions and osteophytes was demonstrated. The findings indicate the utility of AdT1ρ and AdT2ρ mapping as potential biomarkers for evaluation of early cartilage degeneration in OA research and clinical applications.
