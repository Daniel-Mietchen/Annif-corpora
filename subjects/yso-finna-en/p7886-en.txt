All surgical disciplines that deal with the human face must rely on an exact knowledge of its highly complex topographic-anatomical relationships. This atlas provides a unique contribution to the study of facial anatomy in which readers are allowed to explore deeper into the anatomy as the layers are stripped away, one by one. This book features elaborate composite illustrations created in layers, starting from the skeleton and working out to the surface of the skin. CT scans are used for the skeletal template, MRI series depict the inner layers of the facial region, angiographs report the anatomy of the blood vessels, and photographs of anatomical specimens as well as a living model fill out the rest. The final products are anatomical images of hyper 3D clarity and arresting beauty. Significant landmarks, anatomical details, and clinically relevant groupings of nerves and blood vessels are the primary focus of each image series to preserve clinical relevance. Accompanying text and figure legends emphasize key points, but the focus is always on the vivid anatomical images.

The original edition of Emotion in the Human Face, published in 1972, was the first volume to evaluate and integrate all the research on facial expression of emotion since Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals was published in 1872. It presented a detailed, critical discussion of research involving the face and emotion, focusing on the complex conceptual and methodological issues involved, and settling many past controversies, such as whether the face provides accurate information about emotion, and whether some facial expressions are universal. In the second edition, published in 1982, Ekman expanded, reorganized, annotated, and cross-referenced the contents of the first edition, bringing the review of basic research up to date and charting the new developments in the field. This third edition includes a new Preface, three additional chapters, and a new conclusion summarizing Ekman's final views on the field that he played a large part in creating.

COGNITION & COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY. Human faces are unique biological structures which convey a complex variety of important social messages. Even strangers can tell things from our faces - our feelings, our locus of attention, something of what we are saying, our age, sex and ethnic group, whether they find us attractive. In recent years there has been genuine progress in understanding how our brains derive all these different messages from faces and what can happen when one or other of the structures involved is damaged. Face Perception provides an up-to-date, integrative summary by two authors who have helped develop and shape the field over the past 30 years. It encompasses topics as diverse as the visual information our brains can exploit when we look at faces, whether prejudicial attitudes can affect how we see faces, and how people with neurodevelopmental disorders see faces.

No medium competes with oil in the world of portrait painting, and oil is best used to demonstrate principles of skin tones. In Chris Saper's second portrait book for North Light, readers will learn to incorporate life studies to improve accuracy in seeing and recording skin tones. Readers will enjoy two demonstrations for each of seven diverse subjects--one from life, and one from a finished portrait from photographs. Readers will enjoy rendering skin tones in oil as they are shown information on palette selection and materials; lighting and posing the model; the live sitting; the photographic sitting; and mini exercises on specific facial features. Includes all-new art, new information on photography, new step-by-step demonstrations and more.
