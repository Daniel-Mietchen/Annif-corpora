A developer always seeks greater understanding of software engineering and design. Sometimes luck intervenes and a mentor helps to advance one's abilities. However, there are only so many of these rare encounters, and thus, not everyone is afforded such opportunities. This book attempts to remove luck as a limiting factor for one's professional growth in Smalltalk by disseminating material learned over several years of mentoring.
