The aim of this study was to investigate whether risk factors for psychosis are different among those with and without parental psychosis, and to study the interaction between parental psychosis and risk factors. Protective factors for psychosis were also examined. Data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (N = 10,458) was used.Biological risk factors in particular increased the risk for schizophrenia and other psychosis among those with parental psychosis. In the same group, the risk for schizophrenia was increased if the achievement of holding the head up and touching the thumb with the index finger was delayed. A new born’s large size, advanced maternal age and mother’s antenatal depressed mood had interactions with parental psychosis regarding risk for schizophrenia and the mother’s smoking during pregnancy regarding risk for other psychosis. Parental psychosis and delayed touching the thumb with the index finger had an interaction regarding risk for schizophrenia and other psychosis. Several variables were associated with the decreased risk for psychosis in the total sample. In the parental psychosis group, only a mother’s non-depressed mood and a mother’s working outside the home or studying associated to remaining unaffected.This study is one of the few studies to investigate risk factors for psychosis among those with and without parental psychosis and to examine interactions between parental psychosis and risk factors. This study showed that many risk factors increased the risk for schizophrenia and other psychosis only among those with parental psychosis. Hence, parental psychosis might even explain part of the association between some risk factors. Surprisingly few protective factors were found among those with parental psychosis. Further studies on the protective factors for psychosis are important in order to prevent psychosis in individuals at hi gh risk.
