Novel technologies for greenfield exploration. Mineral exploration and mapping within thick glacial overburden, peatlands and different conservation areas is demanding, sensitive and expensive. The best practices for mineral exploration (techniques and concepts) from cost and environmental perspectives have been developed in the project 'Novel technologies for greenfield exploration' funded by Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). Essential exploration techniques include the concurrent use of geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys. These techniques allow the location and thorough investigation of the geological processes responsible for mineral deposits and indications of ore-forming processes, or in suitable conditions, the direct identification of mineral deposits. The efficiency and success of exploration require not only high quality data processing and interpretation, but also the consideration of environmental aspects, which are particularly important in sensitive northern, sub-Arctic areas. The results and methodological advances arising from this project could particularly serve companies and organizations conducting grass root mineral exploration in a regional scale. The techniques can also be adopted in target-scale exploration.

The chemical analysis of foods and food products
This thesis was carried out during the summer and autumn of 2009 in the Quality Control Department of an African pharmaceutical manufacturing plant Universal Corporation Ltd. (UCL). The aim of the thesis was to develop and validate an HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) method for simultaneous analysis of artesunate and amodiaquine from an antimalarial drug called "Double Layer Tablets". Because of Double Layer Tablets being a new product to be launched, any validated method for its analysis did not exist in the Quality Control Laboratory. Therefore, the development of the method had to be based on the knowledge of separate analyses of the substances and the test analyses made in the laboratory with one combined method. In this thesis common method validation parameters such as linearity and accuracy were tested.    Earlier test analyses had cleared out that the most complicated problem in this simultaneous analysis was to get the responses of artesunate and amodiaquine closer to each others values. While amodiaquine was giving a very decent peak (response), the response for artesunate was significantly smaller than could be expected on the ground of the one tablet concentration. The difference in response magnitudes made simultaneous analysis more inaccurate and difficult to interpret so the attention was to be paid to the HPLC parameters of the method. In hope of changing the ratio of responses, the detection wavelength used in the test analyses was changed. Spectra of both artesunate and amodiaquine were found out and from them two most potential wavelength chosen for the analyses.     The aim of getting artesunate and amodiaquine analyzed with one method at the same time and getting the peaks in same scale was not reached by these changes made. Artesunate was still giving responses that were not meeting the requirements.    Although simultaneous analysis did not succeed by these changes, there is still some hope to get the method working. The detection wavelength could be changed again and the effects of it in practise checked in the same way as in this thesis. If in the future the detection still seems to be the biggest problem of a combined method, the active ingredients should probably be analyzed separately with their own methods known to be working.  .
