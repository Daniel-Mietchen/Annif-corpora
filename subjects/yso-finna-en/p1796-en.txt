Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to find out what challenges Finns face in adaptation to working life in Turkey. The objective of the thesis was to understand Turkish and Finnish cultures and by comparing them to find out possible challenges that a Finnish employee might face in Turkish working environment.  The theoretical section of this thesis includes a comparison of various cultural features according to Hofstede's dimensions and a comparison of Finland's and Turkey's working cultures according to Lewis' model. The information for the theoretical part was mostly based on literature of expatrium process and on cultural studies of Finland and Turkey. By utilizing these theories, the empirical part deals with practical examples that are based on the experiences of ten Finns who have moved to Turkey. In the theoretical part differences in hierarchical, collectivistic and in concept of time issues were found, which can be seen in the Finns' experienced challenges of adaptation. In Turkish and Finnish working life the approach is similar, but Finland's and Turkey's working cultures appreciate partly different features in subordinates.  The empirical part focuses on Finnish interviewees' experiences in Turkish working life. The purpose was to find out the challenges Finns have faced by comparing cultures and working life of these two countries. The empirical part is handled closely with the theoretical parts of this thesis so that they can easily be compared. Information for the empirical section was gathered through ten interviews of Finns who have several years of experience in working and living in Turkey. The interviewees confirmed that Turkish language, bureaucracy and a different concept of time were the most challenging aspects for a Finn in Turkish working environment. The interviewees told that their own attitude and understanding of the cultural differences helped them in the adaptation process. The conclusion part deals with the main themes of this research and presents some recommendations on studying the culture, familiarizing with local ideology, and learning the basics of the language.
