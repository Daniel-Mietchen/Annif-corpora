This thesis was conducted for Endero, an ICT service company operating in Finland and Saint Petersburg, Russia. The solution implemented is a part of a company-wide intranet that was developed for a customer operating in the pension insurance sector. The solution provides a quick launch functionality for various line-of-business applications by displaying a selection of links to these applications on the front page of the intranet. The user is provided with a collection of roughly fifty links, from which he can choose a smaller selection of links to be displayed on the front page. Furthermore, the collection of the available links can be modified by the intranet administrators. The solution is an essential part of the intranet, increasing both productivity and end-user satisfaction.    The intranet was implemented using Microsoft's SharePoint 2010 platform and the thesis product itself utilizes a SharePoint's Visual Web Part as a basis for the functionality. Although Web Parts have existed in earlier versions of SharePoint, Visual Web Parts are a new feature provided only by SharePoint 2010. The task also included working with other web development technologies, such as web services, AJAX, jQuery and a JavaScript library called Knockout.    The intranet project was conducted utilizing a cyclic development model, a method based on the elements of Scrum. The cyclic model emphasizes active communication with the customer and within the project team, and minimizes the amount of documentation. In the cyclic model, the whole development team is involved in both planning the sprints and demonstrating the results. During the sprints, the team reports their progress to the project manager and the customer in daily status meetings.    The thesis product was completed succesfully and delivered to the customer on schedule. Additionally, the customer reported that the company's employees have been very satisfied with the new intranet.     Considering the product itself, the concept of a customizable selection of quick launch links to work-aiding tools is highly universal, and it could certainly be used in other intranets, extranets and even public web sites all around the business world.

This thesis is examples driven. The solutions are more practical to the programmer's life, therefore this thesis is written in a more straight forward manners. In this thesis, the content is divided into four main sections. They are tools for debugging and css style fixing; planning and modeling; programming phase; and tools for saving and deployment. These are the stages in the development process that a .NET Site Builder needs to go through. In the tools for javascript debugging and css style fixing section, the tools that are needed to debug JavaScript and fixing CSS properties are discussed. The features of the tool, such as a browser's plug-ins and the best way to benefit from it are also covered in the thesis. During the planning and modeling phases, some short brief information on how to sketch out the graphics, which are given by the designer, directly into the screen or by paper and pencil. In the chapter of programming phase, Microsoft Ajax Library is discussed. An example shows how to benefit from this library package to build custom class object orientated classes, which are similar to the .NET C# classes. In this section, the issue of PNG fixing in Internet Explorer version 6 is also mentioned. The tools for saving and deployment section briefs readers about some useful tools, such as how the project can be managed by version control and how its resources, like PNG, CSS and JavaScript files size, can be reduced significantly. All the codes in the examples can be found in the Appendixes.

The main aim of this thesis was to describe how a single UI code could be used in different operating systems. The objective in this thesis was to bring out the main key points how a hybrid HTML5 application can be implemented by using iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components as a container for a hybrid application. This thesis also describes how a data transfer is done between HTML, JavaScript and native code. As a starting point, a hybrid application was implemented in both Android and iOS platforms. I wanted to implement an application, which would give value for the end users. I studied some time for open web APIs and found out that Finnkino Movie Company was providing a free XML API for their services and the application idea was found. I interviewed some of my friends about the functional needs for the application and also about how the UI should look like. The application itself was designed to use only one platform specific native WebView component. The User Interface was built with the HTML elements and JavaScript because the UI should look the same in both platforms. In my application the native code handles the XML data parsing from the Finnkino’s web API and sends the parsed data to the calling JavaScript function, which will then place the data into the HTML elements dynamically. When the application was completed, all the differences between the platforms were studied and documented into this thesis. As a result iOS’s NSWebView and Android’s WebView components provide a good support for a hybrid application development with some minor differences. The main difference is the performance and how responsive the UI is in these platforms. From the development point of view, I see a great opportunity to implement mobile applications with a web technology, as it is a fast evolving environment introducing new possibilities for the developers in a very fast phase. And from the business point of view, I can see a great opportunity for smaller companies, or individual developers because with a single effort the application UI can be created for multiple platforms and this saves money and resources.

This bachelor thesis is about how to study and integrate Bootstrap 3 into OpixManager. The purpose is to improve user interface of OpixManager application. OpixManager is constructed by using CodeIgniter and Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. OpixManager application is for project management. It includes staff augmentation, customer management, report management and so on. It is to support both scrum and traditional software development process. There are two major parts included in this thesis work. The theoretical part is about studying what is responsive web design, and what components are included in Bootstrap 3. The author also study how OpixManager's CodeIgniter interrelates among the model, the view and the controller in the theoretical part. The theoretical framework gives the author knowledge how to integrate Bootstrap template to OpixManager's user interface. The empirical part is actual implementation and testing of template page, login page and home page as well as its link pages in OpixManager. Final results has been tested in cross-browser through local host server such as Mozilla Firefox, in Internet Explorer and in Chrome. I used Freelancer template's design in this thesis. Typography and color palette are balanced and modern. Navigation bar and grid system are responsive, they are squeezed onto a tiny mobile device or stretched onto a wide screen.

It is important for a company, whose income is based on the number of the active customers to have a way to track how well they can keep their customers and to know what their customers think about their services. The aim of this Bachelor’s thesis was to develop a new feature that allows the manager of a company to track the rate in which company loses active customers and a way that allows managers to create surveys or ask questions that can help them to improve their services, this information can then help them reduce the rate in which they lose customers. The feature was developed using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and MySQL. PHPUnit testing framework was utilized for testing backend PHP code and Twig template engine was utilized for frontend PHP. As a result of this thesis, a new feature was implemented into an existing system. This feature has 2 views. The first one allows the manager of a company to view the customer attrition rate displayed as a line chart or in a table. Another one allows the manager to create questions for the customers and the created questions will then be displayed to customers when they log into the service. In future the feature can be expanded to track the rate of how long customers stay active after joining or adding new types of tracked customers by age, family relations or group exercise.
