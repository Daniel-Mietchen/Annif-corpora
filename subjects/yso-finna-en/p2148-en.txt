In the bachelor's thesis a business plan was created to evaluate the profitability of the original business idea for a new environmental consulting company to be established in SaÌƒo Paulo, Brazil. The company will provide practical solutions in environmental issues for small and medium-sized enterprises. Consulting as a business is multi-layered and complex. In the beginning of the bachelor's thesis consulting was viewed as a business form and essential consulting skills and defining a consultancy project were presented. A brief presentation of specific cultural features that need to be taken into consideration was also given. Environmental legislation and its effects on business now and in future were presented with relevant environmental concepts.  In the business plan a detail list of legal requirements for business start-ups was given and an investment calculation was made. From the basis of a business environment description target clients, products, marketing plan and the need for networking were defined. Two environmental evaluation tools were presented for the company to use. In the end of the business plan a risk analysis and growth plan were created. In the research a clear demand for practical environmental solutions for small companies was found, but the risks were also high when entering an unknown market area. A local partner has been confirmed and the company will be established in the beginning of 2011.

Abstract: Management consulting. Management consulting has long roots that reach all the way to the 19th century. First known as efficiency experts, they worked to improve efficiency on the shop floor level. Quite soon after, management consulting started to evolve in to a industry challenging the traditional industries. Today, the main purpose of management consultancies is to study and analyze the structure and functioning of a company as a whole or part of its segments and to find opportunities and strategies to improve the company's efficiency in the management level. The thesis aims to illustrate how management consulting has evolved over the years, how do the client and consultant communicate with each other, how to make consulting engagements as successful as possible and what problems might rise when dealing with management consultancies. The study was carried out by analyzing a number of different literature sources and by assembling the information into a form that would allow the reader to look directly into the client-consultant interaction. All the presented information aims to help the understanding of management consulting and the practical issues revolving around it.

Consultancy Skills for Mission and Ministry provides a readable handbook to doing consultancy in church based organisations. Many of those who exercise ministry in churches move into roles where they are expected to supervise and support ministers and church leaders in their work. Consultancy is an effective way of doing this and provides skills and theoretical frameworks for both those working explicitly as consultants to ministers and church workers and leaders as well as for officers in churches such as Archdeacons, Superintendents, Mission Officers, local church and regional development advisers or those involved in continuing professional development. Often people moving into these roles are not provided with the specific skills and knowledge they need. Other groups who will find this book useful will include consultants who operate in commercial, public and voluntary organisations but who need to know how to apply their skills in church settings and students on courses in consultancy.
