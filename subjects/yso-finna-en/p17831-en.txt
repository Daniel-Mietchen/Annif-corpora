In this studies the different methods of stiffening a structure were studied and compared to each other. The thesis presents diagonal and chevron methods of stiffening a steel structure as well as the benefits and applications of the methods. In addition, the determination of load combinations was conducted according to EN 1990+A1+AC and Finnish National annex EN 1990. The goal of the thesis was to compare the costs of both methods by calculating material consumption in them. The stability of the structure and the optimization of structural element profiles were completed by a software called Robot Structural Analysis Professional.
