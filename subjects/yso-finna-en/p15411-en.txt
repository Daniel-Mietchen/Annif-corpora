Israel and Palestine : assault on the law of the nations
Recognition of governments in international law : with particular reference to governments in exile
"This book evaluates the present European Union (EU) approach to state-building, both in policy and operation. It offers a review of the literature on (EU) peace building, EU, state-building and conflict resolution, before examining in detail the European Union's role as a state-builder in the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territories following the 1993 Oslo Accords.Drawing on extensive fieldwork and over 140 interviews carried out in Brussels, London, Jerusalem and Ramallah with EU, Palestinian and Israeli officials as well as academics, members of NGOs and civil society, the author evaluates the present approach of state-building and offers a framework to test the effectiveness of the EU as a state-builder. Examining security sector reform, judiciary sector reform and the rule of law, the book measures the contribution of the EU to state-building against a backdrop of on-going conflict and a polarised social setting.This book will be of interest to students and scholars of international relations, EU politics, Middle Eastern politics and state-building"--

Recognizing states : international society and the establishment of new states since 1776
"Between the early seventeenth and mid-nineteenth centuries, major European political thinkers first began to look outside their national borders and envisage a world of competitive, equal sovereign states inhabiting an international sphere that ultimately encompassed the whole globe. In this insightful and wide-ranging work, David Armitage - one of the world's leading historians of political thought - traces the genesis of this international turn in intellectual history. Foundations of Modern International Thought combines important methodological essays, which consider the genealogy of globalisation and the parallel histories of empires and oceans, with fresh considerations of leading figures such as Hobbes, Locke, Burke and Bentham in the history of international thought. The culmination of more than a decade's reflection and research on these issues, this book restores the often overlooked international dimensions to intellectual history and recovers the intellectual dimensions of international history"--
