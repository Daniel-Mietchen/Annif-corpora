Food supply chain management : issues for the hospitality and retail sectors
With crisp and insightful contributions from 47 of the world's leading experts in various facets of retailing, Retailing in the 21st Century offers in one book a compendium of state-of-the-art, cutting-edge knowledge to guide successful retailing in the new millennium. In our competitive world, retailing is an exciting, complex and critical sector of business in most developed as well as emerging economies. Today, the retailing industry is being buffeted by a number of forces simultaneously, for example the growth of online retailing and the advent of 'radio frequency identification' (RFID) technology. Making sense of it all is not easy but of vital importance to retailing practitioners, analysts and policymakers.

Without design, the "brand identity" is just a name, sometimes paired with a statement that enumerates the values of the company. It is two-dimensional when written down or printed. The task for the retail designer is to turn that name or statement into a three-dimensional environment in which consumers may interact with the brand's product or services. Designing the Brand Identity in Retail Spaces is a casebook that shows and tells how architects and store designers have tackled that challenge. With nearly 300 examples from 48 renowned brands from around the world, this book examines every stage of a brand's "lifetime," from inception to show room. Cases run the retail gamut, including restaurants, department stores, and luxury brands. Each case is paired with analysis and interviews with brand managers and designers, guiding the reader through the entire design process. Easy to read and replete with stunning illustrations, this is the perfect primer for students and young professionals creating brand identities in their retail design.

Three decades of research into retailing in England from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries has established a seemingly clear narrative: fixed shops were widespread from an early date; 'modern' methods of retailing were common from at least the early eighteenth century; shopping was a skilled activity throughout the period; and consumers were increasingly part of - and aware of being part of - a polite and fashionable culture. All of this is true, but is it the only narrative? Research has shown that markets were still important well into the nineteenth century and small scale producer-retailers co-existed with modern warehouses. Many shops were not smart. The development of modern retailing therefore was a fractured and fragmented process. This book presents a reassessment of the standard view by challenging the usefulness of concepts like 'traditional' and 'modern', examining consumption and retailing as inextricably linked aspects of a single process, and by using the idea of narrative to discuss the roles and perceptions of the various actors in this process - such as retailers, shoppers/consumers, local authorities and commentators. The book is therefore structured around some of these competing narratives in order to provide a richer and more varied picture of consumption and retailing in provincial England.
