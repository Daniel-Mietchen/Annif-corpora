Abstract: This study was commissioned by Ewals Cargo Care, which transports cargo with Mega trailers in Europe using a number of intermodal solutions to achieve cost-efficient transport for the needs of the customers. The main objective of this study was to determine the estimated sea freight rates increase in 2015 when the tighter sulphur directive will come into force. The objective was also to find out the current situation and the commercial value of the Baltic Sea as well as solutions for the ship-ping companies to respond to tighter sulphur directive.  The purpose of this study was to calculate the estimated increase of the sea freight rates in a few routes so that Ewals Cargo Care could prepare for possible rise in pric-es in the near future. The study was divided into theoretical and empirical part with equal proportions. Theory section introduces the commercial situation of the Baltic Sea, the sulphur directive and the structure of the shipping costs.  In the empirical analysis part the new freight rates were calculated, solutions for tighter suphur directive challenges was searched and two interviews were held with shipping companies which are in cooperation with Ewals Cargo Care. Interviews and calculations are also the part of the execution of the study which also is the major research process.  After the empirical part of the study results were reviewed and conclusions of the studied subject were presented. Frames of the interviews, tables of the current and new freight rates are attached in the end of the study.
The lake functioning has been an interesting subject for limnologist and more importantly, the sustainability of humic lakes. The major challenge has always been in sampling the anaerobic bacteria form hypolimnion without the contamination of samples by light and oxygen. This study focused on developing and testing one method and yielded a result without the samples being contaminated.  The sampling method consisted of syringe and tube that was wrapped with tape (3 folds) to cut any light contamination to the samples while pulling them. The incubation vials were vacuumed to negative pressure to make sure no contamination of samples with the oxygen.  To further mimic the natural environment, the vials were wrapped in black painted water soluble paper to reduce the effect of light while filling those vials; and would dissolve in water in no time so that the natural light condition could be attained at those respective depths of sampling. Since the method fulfilled most of its required categories, better results were obtained with a clear difference in light and dark production.
