InvoDane Engineering is an engineering consulting company that specializes in providing engineering services for oil, gas and water pipeline industries. This engineering thesis was commissioned by the company and it is a development project for pump unit with water hydraulics. The pump unit is a hydraulic power pack whose main components are a pressure pump and a vacuum pump. The purpose of the pump unit is to actuate a cylinder piston and power the hydraulics onboard the piston. The hydraulic system is used when inserting a water inspection tool into a water pipeline and extracting it from the pipeline. The objectives of the work were to do a feasibility study of an electrically driven system, reduce system weight and improve flow rate capacity at high pressure. The enhancements were to be demonstrated and tested by assembling a prototype pump unit. Improvement suggestions for shipping characteristics and system filtration were also to be presented. The system was tested and test results confirmed that electric motor can run the pump and replace the gas engine in the original system under the circumstances it was tested in. Based merely on the tests performed, it is not yet possible to reduce weight and ease the use of the unit by excluding the vacuum pump from the system. Improved hose and valve arrangement in the test setup proofed itself to be a good base to start developing the functionality of the hydraulics further.  Next step in developing the pump unit would be to test the setup in real insertion and extraction situations with cylinder piston and decide on future enhancements based on the results.

Design of brushless permanent-magnet machines
The Permanent Magnet machine is the natural choice of many niche drive applications because of their higher efficiency and compact size. Among various types of PM machines, the Interior Permanent Magnet Machine (IPMM) is gaining popularity in many applications because of its robust rotor and prospect of wider CPSR. However, the design and control of the IPM machine are mentioned in many PM machine technology books merely as a variation of the conventional PM machines which is inadequate for professionals involve in development of the IPMM.This book addresses the issue by starting with the review of the existing IPMM technology and then leading to the optimization process for developing a new prototype based on a particular application such as the Integrated Starter Alternator (ISA) for automobile. The analysis of this new design should be useful as a case study for researchers, academic, professionals or anyone else who is engaged in development of the IPM machine. (Editorial review)

"Reflecting the latest innovations in the development of PM motors for electromechanical drives, Permanent Magnet Motor Technology: Design and Applications, Third Edition demonstrates the construction of PM motor drives and supplies ready-to-implement solutions to common roadblocks along the way. This up-to-date edition supplies fundamental equations and calculations for determining and evaluating system performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost. It explores modern computer-aided design of PM motors, including the finite element approach, and explains how to select PM motors to meet the specific requirements of electrical drives. The numerous examples, models, and diagrams provided in each chapter facilitate a lucid understanding of motor operations and characteristics."--BOOK JACKET.
