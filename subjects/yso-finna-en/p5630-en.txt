The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to study the investment and operating expenses of bearing pads on different sized container vessels. The results are intended for Cargotec's in-house purposes. Some of the graphical charts may be used for sales aid in customer meetings. The attempt was to prove the assumptions made about the investment and operating expenses. By verifying one of the pad types to be more profitable than the others, the information could be used for sales aid purposes. The results would support choosing a bearing pad type for a certain sized vessel. The second part of this thesis was to produce a calculation tool to be able to explore the effect of changing specific variables. This calculation tool is intended to be used as a help for sales representatives when preparing their sales material before customer meetings. It is intended to be used quickly and easily. As a result, the expenses for four different sized container vessels were specified. The ideal bearing pad arrangement was found for each vessel size and the results were as expected. Creating and using the calculation tool was successful and is working as expected.

Survey of the logistic factors in the TSR-railway operation : "what TSR-station masters think about the Trans-Siberian?"
Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to find different route options for transporting danger-ous goods from Rauma mill to the customer located in Leiria, Portugal. The aim was to find three possible options; one straight route and two options which sail via one port in central Europe. This study was made by assignment of Forchem, which goods were delivered in the researched case.  The information for the theory part of this thesis was gathered from literature and websites. In theory part was went through the maritime transport especially in the Baltic Sea, IMDG code and containers. There was also an own chapter for case company and the product that was delivered in the case.  The research for this study was made by e-mail survey. The survey was sent to selected quarters which were specific ports in Finland, Spain and Portugal. Also some shipping companies were approached. The purpose of the empirical study was to point out the options which the case company could seek further.  When receiving the answers from the ports and shipping companies was arose the fact that there could have been wider amount of responses to get more comparison material. However with the answers received by the survey, it was possible to point out three route options as was supposed.

UPM-Kymmene Oyj is one of the world's leading paper industry companies. The purpose of this thesis was to create container optimizing tool for UPM customer service. Background of the thesis was to develop way of working in the order creation phase and accomplish cost-efficiency by optimizing container payloads. Cost-efficiency means finding correct order amounts and maximizing sea containers capacity.  Thesis focuses how orders are created in customer service and its needs to optimizing order amounts. In addition ground rules and initial data concerning optimization process were defined during this the thesis work. Source data were found from UPMs internal systems and from ISO-standards. Many development points were found in the middle of the tool creation and in test phase.  Thesis includes history of the containers and it shows how container markets have been increased to ease understanding how important fully usage of container capacities. Thesis describes all the way of container order process from order creation to customer delivery.

The purpose of this Bachelor's thesis was to explore the possibilities to standardise the lashing eye plate arrangement locations on lashing bridges. The standard for lashing eye plate arrangements is intended for MacGREGOR's in-house standard on lashing bridge design. An attempt was also made to find a unified lashing bar length. By finding the unified lashing length for a bar, it could then be used in all lashing fittings on a bridge. A unified lashing bar would essentially decrease the quantity of different size lashing bars but also make all the lashing cases more compatible. The second part of the thesis is to produce a calculation tool -database and a manual to be able to explore all the lashing case lengths on different eye plate arrangement locations on both bridges. This effective multi-purpose database is intended to be used as a help when designing lashing bridges, lashing fittings and eye plate's arrangements. As a result, the lashing eye plate arrangements for both bridge types were specified. However, the ideal outcome for the unified lashing bar length could not be reached because of the total range of the lashing fittings. Creating and using the multi-purpose database was successful and worked as expected.
