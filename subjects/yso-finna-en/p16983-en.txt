A simple shrub is made from fruit, sugar, and ... vinegar? Raise your glass to a surprising new taste sensation for cocktails and sophisticated sodas: Shrubs. Not the kind that grow in the ground, but a vintage drink mixer that will knock your socks off. "Mixologists across the country are reaching back through the centuries to reclaim vinegar's more palatable past...embracing it as 'the other acid,' an alternative to the same-old-same-old lemons and limes," said the New York Times. The history of shrubs, as revealed here, is as fascinating as the drinks are refreshing. These sharp and tangy infusions are simple to make and use, as you'll discover with these recipes. Mix up some Red Currant Shrub for a Vermouth Cassis, or Apple Cinnamon Shrub to mix with seltzer, or develop your own with Michael Dietsch's directions and step-by-step photographs.
