The purpose of this thesis was to study, how much energy is used in pumping fluids in each auxiliary system of marine main engine and to choose the system that is the most energy consuming. After choosing one system for closer observation the target was to study how pumping energy efficiency of that specific auxiliary system can be improved by changing the design, but still keeping the original technical limits for the system valid. 9L46 marine main engine was chosen as a reference engine for all calculations and all the component data for each part and unit of different manufacturer was obtained from the TERPS database in Wärtsilä Ship power's intranet page. Based on the calculated results a ballpark economical estimate of investment difference between a normal system and an energy efficient system was made.

Spare Part Optimization for W32 Fuel Injection Equipment
The environment has of recent become a major concern of individuals, organisations and the government, unlike the non-challant attitude shown towards it in time past. Various positive actions and moves have been taken which are effectively backed up by laws in ensuring a drastic reduction in the burden placed on it from the daily human activities, most especially in the manufacturing sector. Some of these moves involve the determination of the total effects a good or service has on the environment, which is effectively carried out with the Life Cycle Assessment LCA technique. Umberto software for carbon footprint was used in this study which was aimed at determining the effects of the production, assembly, testing, use, and final disposal or recycling of a Hydraulic Water Pump HWP on the environment. The entire life cycle of the HWP was assessed following the basic LCA process. The HWP that was assessed is one of the numerous products made by company X. The HWP had the highest carbon footprint from the raw materials phase of its life cycle, which was 72,96 kg CO2-eq out of the total 95,78  kg CO2-eq calculated for the five life cycle phases, while the least recorded environmental effect was from its distribution/retail phase of the life cycle, with 0,04 kg CO2-eq.

An explanation and guideline for pumping calculations
Heat pumps can heat a building by 'pumping' heat from either the ground or the air outside: an intriguing process which utilizes principles that are somewhat analogous to those employed in the domestic refrigerator. This title presents the necessary knowledge to take advantage of this potentially low-carbon technology to heat their properties.
