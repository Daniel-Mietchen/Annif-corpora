The objective of the thesis was to explore customer behaviour of leisure travellers in Dubai concerning their use of tourist services (incl. tourist attractions, activities and places of interest) analyzing the reasons and bases related to their choice and consumption of tourist services. The aim of the study was to help a rather new local travel agency to continue getting successfully oriented into business activity and develop professionally improving their level of service. The theoretical framework was based on literature about tourist services, tourism industry in Dubai, segmentation in tourism industry, marketing (e.g. written by Kotler, P.), Generation Y, qualitative research method (e.g. written by Silverman, D.). The study was conducted in the form of individual interviews with the people having personal experience of a leisure trip in Dubai. The research methodology was qualitative. Some additional data was gathered through an interview with the GM of the commissioner company in order to clarify facts presented in thesis. The findings indicated that travellers show resemblance in being interested in using tourist services presented in Dubai choosing several major services and attractions well advertised and promoted outside of UAE. Respondents also gave their positive and negative opinion related to various services. The results also confirmed the popularity of Internet as a source of information and a self-booking tool inside the chosen traveller segment. The range of tourist services presented in Dubai was found to be sufficient in general; however, some suggestions for improvement were made. In conclusion, there are several recommendations for the commissioner company concerning the advertisement of the company reaching the potential customers, special attention should be paid to Internet. The commissioner company should also benefit from the comments and feedback on the use of various tourist services given by the respondents when assisting its costumers in using the same services prior to the trip or during it depending on the service.

The Deaf way II reader : perspectives from the second international conference on deaf culture
'Trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease' (Benjamin Franklin). Such negative evaluations of idleness and their contrary, positive re-evaluations, as in Cyril Connolly's 'Idleness is only a coarse name for my infinite capacity for living in the present', have been common attitudes towards leisurely disporting and idle repose. This collection of essays traces the history of representations of idleness, indolence and leisure in English literature from the late Middle Ages to the present day. It focuses on issues as varied as the figure of the idle apprentice in the Elizabethan pamphlet wars, the 'lazy native' in British colonial discourse, positive re-evaluations of indolence and repose in the Romantic era and the delights of tramping in early twentieth-century prose. The contributions also significantly inflect current theoretical debates on race, class and gender. The topicality of the subject is emphasized by two pieces of sociological analysis which serve as epilogues to the volume.

Providing a critical introduction to the leading positions in leisure theory, Betsy Wearing guides the reader through their strengths and weaknesses from a feminist perspective. This book draws attention to the various leisure experiences that women encounter and construct in their everyday lives and the meanings that these experiences have for them. Her perspective takes into account such poststructuralist ideas as multiple subjectivities of women and multiple femininities; the possibilities of resistance to male dominance in leisure; the potential through leisure of rewriting masculine and feminine scripts; and leisure as a site of struggle to challenge hegemonic masculinity.
