The book presents the latest advances in research into health effects of air pollution, with heavy motor vehicle traffic or cigarette smoke as the exemplar of pollution. The airways are the first-line defense system against pollution. The book focuses on respiratory ailments underlain by inflammation, increased susceptibility to infection, particularly acquired during harsh environmental conditions and exposures to particulate matter or pathogens. The importance of astute analysis of lung function for early diagnosis of disorders is underscored. A knowledge deficit concerning the aerosolized drug delivery through the airways also is addressed. Recent developments and viewpoints in the field of environmental health hazards as well as methodological advances in their assessment are provided. The book will be of interest to pulmonologists, healthcare providers, researchers and clinicians engaged in environment-related respiratory diseases, but also to policy makers concerned with clean ambient air quality.

Evolutionary Psychiatry was first published in 1996, the second edition followed in 2000. This ground breaking book challenged the medical model which supplied few effective answers to long-standing conundrums. A comprehensive introduction to the science of Darwinian Psychiatry, the second edition included important fresh material on a number of disorders, along with a chapter on research. Anthony Stevens and John Price argue that psychiatric symptoms are manifestations of ancient adaptive strategies which are no longer necessarily appropriate but which can best be understood and treated in an evolutionary and developmental context. Particularly important are the theories Stevens and Price propose to account for the worldwide existence of mood disorders and schizophrenia, as well as offering solutions for such puzzles as paedophilia, sado-masochism and the function of dreams. Readily accessible to both the specialist and non-specialist reader, Evolutionary Psychiatry describes in detail the disorders and conditions commonly encountered in psychiatric practice and shows how evolutionary theory can account for their biological origins and functional nature. This Classic Edition of the book includes a new preface by Anthony Stevens and a foreword by Paul Gilbert.

Recent years have witnessed considerable growth in the field of psychoneuroimmunology, which describes how psychological factors, such as stress and depression, impact the neurological and immune systems. Kathleen Kendall-Tackett and an elite group of researchers explore the ways physical and psychological stressors such as poor sleep, PTSD, and depression, trigger the inflammatory response and increase the risk of disease. They approach this material from a variety of perspectives. Chapters in Part I describe the biological processes involved in inflammation, focusing on both the typical bodily response to threat as well as on the long-term deleterious effects of stress upon the immune system; while chapters in Part II examine the role of psychosocial stress in disease etiology. Throughout, chapter authors present evidence of connections between mind and body, and emphasize the need for improved communication between physicians and mental health care providers.

This proceedings volume will contain chapters based upon the presentation of the 2nd International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer in Colorado, 2013. The various topics explore the affects of alcohol on: liver and breast cancer, cell signaling and cancer, stem cells, biomarkers and metabolomics, aerodigestive cancers, cancer and the immune system, and more. In the recent years, a significant amount of research has emerged connecting the link between alcohol and cancer. The field has rapidly advanced, especially since the complex connection between alcohol and cancer has several unique sub areas that are being investigated and this volume gives a comprehensive overview of these advancements.

"This issue of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics in North America will focus on the advances in the evaluation and management of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) that have emerged within the last few years. Although spontaneous pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in reproductive-aged women, RPL occurs in 2% to 5% of the same population. Recent reports on large populations of women with RPL have helped to characterize the incidence and diversity of this heterogeneous disorder, and a definite cause of pregnancy loss can be established on over 50% of all couples after a thorough evaluation. New diagnostic strategies, which include 23-chromosome microarray genetic testing of the products of conception in failed pregnancies, offer the promise of understanding the cause of most pregnancy losses. These recent advances, combined with the contributions from the authors in this issue of Clinics and many others interested in this field, lead to the publication of the long-awaited publication on evaluation and treatment of RPL from the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. A complete evaluation will include investigations into genetic, anatomic, immunologic, endocrinologic, and iatrogenic factors." -- (Elsevier)

The impairment of lung function caused by environmental exposure to pollutants and toxicants is a rising health problem, particularly in highly industrialized parts of the world. The problem is urgently calling for the development of new methodologies to assess both the level of elemental exposure and the effects for quality of health and longevity. This volume provides state-of-the-art information about the recent advances in occupational and non-occupational pollutant-related disorders of the respiratory tract, and the assessment of a threat they pose for the health-span. Heavy traffic-related air pollution, unnoticeable but salient health detriment, is dealt with at length.

The purpose of this thesis was to compile a written self-care guide for the liver cirrhosis patients. A written guidebook supports the spoken guidance given e.g. in the hospital. This thesis was also intended to be used by those who are studying medical-surgical nursing. The understanding of pathophysiology caused by liver cirrhosis is fundamental for both, patients and nurses. The objective of this thesis was to provide more information from liver cirrhosis, its etiology and symptoms, and to give advice for a patient's self-care. Well-designed written patient instructions were also analyzed. The importance for this project arouse from the fact that over 500 people are dying of the cirrhosis in Finland every year. Referring to studies liver cirrhosis is a serious, growing health problem in Finland. Cirrhosis is a state of a liver disease that cannot be cured, but the objective of the care is to stop the progress of the cirrhosis. Information provided by a health care professional can have an essential effect on keeping the condition of the liver cirrhotic patient from getting worse. This thesis was a functional process. The information was gathered from professional literature and from electronic sources; articles regarding liver cirrhosis, care and self-care. The theoretical part of this thesis is the basis of the final product which is a printed leaflet. The leaflet describes the background of the disease and gives the basic instructions for a liver cirrhosis patient's self-care. The information in the guide was demonstrated as clearly as possible, so it would be understandable and easy to follow by the patients. Plenty of information about liver cirrhosis and its etiology and symptoms was found successfully. However, a new medical research provides constantly a lot of new information about the subject. Therefore, the information of this thesis related to the subject has to be updated regularly.
