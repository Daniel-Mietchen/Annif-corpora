The impairment of lung function caused by environmental exposure to pollutants and toxicants is a rising health problem, particularly in highly industrialized parts of the world. The problem is urgently calling for the development of new methodologies to assess both the level of elemental exposure and the effects for quality of health and longevity. This volume provides state-of-the-art information about the recent advances in occupational and non-occupational pollutant-related disorders of the respiratory tract, and the assessment of a threat they pose for the health-span. Heavy traffic-related air pollution, unnoticeable but salient health detriment, is dealt with at length.

This nearly 1,500-page treatise is authored by the worldwide authority on the subject, Dr. Kálmán Vánky, who has spent more than 50 years collecting and describing smut fungi species. The book provides complete and detailed presentations of species in 93 genera through descriptions and illustrations. The book updates our knowledge of valid scientific names and synonyms and provides taxonomic references and the host plant range of each species. Dr. Vánky's passion for the topic shines through on every page through the excellent illustrations and detailed descriptions which complement each other to make identification easier. Having all content in a single volume allows the reader to flip back and forth between similar looking fungi for detailed comparison and analysis"--Pub. desc.
