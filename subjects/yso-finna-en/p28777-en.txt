The aim of this book, a collection of essays that emerged as the result of a literary project as part of the fourth International Polar Year, is to provide a sorely needed guide to the literary histories of the Arctic. It is in part a reaction to what the editors note as a lack of knowledge about the literature of the region even among students and researchers from within the region itself, with the aim to counteract this by creating a basis for comparison: a new space where new angles and perspectives might arise . The essays take the reader on a literary journey from the Nordic region to North America and continuing to Siberia. The essays cross ethnic and national boundaries—while maintaining distinctly national sections—in an exploration of oral tradition and literature. In producing a survey of the literary histories of the Arctic, the collection explores what triggers the need for written literature; in what circumstances and forms oral literature is maintained; and the interactions between oral and written traditions.

The circumpolar Arctic is at the center of multiple controversies as international competition over resources threatens the places that many people call home. This collection takes the home and the hearth as a central site revealing the ways in which history, cosmology, demography, colonialism, and architecture are intertwined. Based on years of in-depth, international research, this book presents and analyzes how the peoples of the circumpolar North envision their dwelling places using local idioms of life appropriate to the region. This book sets a new standard for interdisciplinary work within the humanities and social sciences and includes the work of anthropologists, museum curators, archaeologists, and demographers.
