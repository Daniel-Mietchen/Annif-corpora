The author wrote dozens of columns for Shop Talk magazine that addressed the full gamut of CNC topics, such as tapping, threading and knurling; program length and memory needs; G-codes, M-functions, cycles, macros; and more. This book collects over 60 of these columns that have been unavailable since Shop Talk ceased publication. Each column has been reviewed since its initial publication and updated as needed to reflect ongoing changes in the field. They are presented here in chronological order according to when they first appeared. A table of contents organized by topic is also included.
