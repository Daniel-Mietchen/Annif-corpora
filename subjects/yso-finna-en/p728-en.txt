Managing emergencies and crises
This explorative study presents an empirical examination of the connection between motivation and the measures individuals take to prevent everyday accidents and prepare for crises. Positional factors (age and gender) and situational factors (education, size of locality, and household composition) are included because the literature highlights their importance. The study used data gathered in a 2010/2011 poll of randomly selected Swedish residents aged 16-75 (N = 2000; 44.8% response rate). A factor analysis reduced the theoretical model for situational motivation (Guay, Vallerand, & Blanchard, 2000) from four to two dimensions: motivation and amotivation. Subsequent regression analyses statistically confirmed the connection between motivation or amotivation and the extent to which individuals pursue preventative and preparedness measures, even when accounting for positional and situational factors. These findings underscore the need for continued studies of individuals' incentives to prevent accidents and prepare for crises and for the study of the nuances of (situational) motivation and preventive/preparedness measures.
Central government communications in incidents and emergencies
The revolution in military affairs : implications for Canada and NATO
At the height of the financial crisis some weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Eurosystem adopted a full allotment policy in the refinancing of banks. The move from variable rate tenders and controlling the amounts of liquidity provided to the banks towards fixed interest rates was necessary when the financial intermediation capacity of the banking system had been paralysed and the traditional way implementing monetary policy had led to a significant increase in the price of central bank liquidity provision. This article examines how ensuring banks' access to liquidity through central bank operations has resulted in a situation where, for five years already, short-term money market rates have been lower than the interest rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO rate), that is, the Eurosystem's traditional key steering rate. The article discusses central banks' short-term challenges in the steering of interest rates and outlines a longer-term operational model that would enable the dual use of credit operations both for steering interest rates and, in parallel, for ensuring the availability of central bank funding. The model is based on a differentiated use of collateral in different types of operations conducted by the Eurosystem..

"Arguing that disasters configure the political in new ways, this collection provides a truly international insight into how they can help us to understand the materiality and the pragmatics of politics. As events of radical disruption, disasters can also lead to a re-evaluation of the very definition of the political itself. In exploring these issues, the collection brings together disaster studies, with political theory and science and technology studies, to stimulate a more robust conversation between disciplines and feed into broader sociological debates. Takes an innovative approach to the relationship between disasters and the nature, composition, and effects of the political Leading experts scrutinize how events of radical disruption enable a re-evaluation and redefinition of the political, and the tools and processes through which this happens Comparative case studies give an unrivalled geographic scope, covering Australia, Europe, South America, and the United Kingdom and United States Brings together disaster studies, political theory, and science and technology studies to stimulate broader sociological debate Combines empirical and theoretical approaches to provide an essential teaching resource for graduate and postgraduate students and to open up this dynamic field for mainstream sociology researchers and academics "--

Introduction to international disaster management
"The goal of this collection is to expand and rethink the connections between disasters and the political. Taking an innovative approach that encompasses empirical and theoretical studies, leading experts in the field explore how disasters configure the political in new ways, providing a lens for understanding what the political is and the pragmatics of politics. As events of radical disruption, disasters also enable the redefinition of the political itself, and associated notions such as controversy, crisis, and risk. The political nature of disasters is addressed from three different angles: how materials and non-human entities are engaged in disastrous politics, how disasters are measured, projected and anticipated, and how situations of radical disorganization are ordered and governed. Comparative, international case studies from the United Kingdom and the United States, along with Australia, Europe, and South America, combine science and technology studies, disaster studies, and political theory to provide an integrated account of the link between disasters and the political for researchers and academics. Together, they stimulate a more robust conversation between disciplines to feed into broader sociological debates"--
