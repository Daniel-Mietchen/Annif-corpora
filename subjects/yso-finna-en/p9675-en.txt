Getting a job requires many things: hard skills, soft skills, the right attitude and motivation. To develop the degree programme in Business Information Systems in Oulu university of Applied Sciences (Oulu UAS), three surveys were conducted, to study importance of skills and knowledge in professional life: a graduate career survey in 2013, an employer survey in 2014, and a student survey in 2015. According to the results, readiness for change, learning skills and basic ICT skills seem to be the most important skills. To succeed at work, an adequate basis of hard skills, soft interpersonal and communication skills are needed. Also problem solving and pressure endurance seem to be very important.

During the past two decades, a competence approach has gained popularity in education, as a vast amount of educational institutions have been established to provide university level education in those fields that have traditionally relied on vocational education, such as the hospitality and tourism industry. The competency approach is centred on the development of the specific qualities that the industry expects from graduates. Haaga Institute Polytechnic has been running an English Bachelor level degree programme in Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management.  Its aim has been to develop competent managers for the hospitality and tourism industry. The Programme has been running for over 10 years, and since its establishment there has not been research conducted to evaluate how successful it has been. This research was set up to find out whether Haaga Institute's Bachelor programme has been successful in identifying and developing the core competencies that are needed by the managers in the hospitality industry.    To find the answer to the research problem, a quantitative research was conducted. The Bachelor Programme graduates were asked to participate.  Data was collected from 15 respondents. The findings indicated that Haaga Institute's Bachelor curriculum has identified the core competences that are needed by managers in the hospitality industry, and that most of the competencies had been well developed during Haaga Institute's education.  Due to the low response rate, the findings cannot be considered definitive, but more as suggestive development ideas.  Though they are only suggestive development ideas, the research suggests that further investigation be done on the core competencies that were considered not as well developed as others.  It also suggests that another, similar research be conducted including both the Finnish and the English degree programmes.

The purpose of this study was to gain knowledge about the current situation of BIT degree programme graduates at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, and additionally gain feedback on the degree programme for further improvement. The research was commissioned by OUAS, in honor of the degree programme’s 10th anniversary in the autumn of 2014. The research task was completed in two parts. Firstly, preliminary research was done in order to build a theoretical foundation in order to familiarize the subject with the topic, as no previous research has been conducted about BIT degree programmes in Finland. Secondly, a practical research part was developed in the form of a survey, and sent out to 79 graduates, of which 28 responded in a survey and two agreed for an in-depth interview. The main conclusion, which can be drawn from the survey results, is that BIT graduates are doing very well in their current occupation, as 92.9% of the respondents had found an active occupation in employment or additional studies. Additionally, feedback on the degree programme was relatively good, although many students suggested that the course curriculum was too broad and unspecialized and requested more specific courses and/or the option to pursue minor and major study subjects.
