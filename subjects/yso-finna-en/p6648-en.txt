Threatened flora of semi-natural grasslands : preservation and restoration
The preservation of viable agricultural landscapes is essential in Finland and throughout Europe, because a considerable proportion of threatened species are associated with rural habitats, particularly various grasslands. In this study, the regional distribution of Finnish grasslands was studied using an existing nationwide digital land-use database. Further, the occurrence of traditional rural biotopes and selected butterfly and bird species living in different grassland habitats was investigated in relation to agricultural landscape mosaic. The results showed that grasslands were typically abundant in versatile agricultural regions, land uplift shores as well as in agriculturally marginal landscapes experiencing decrease of agricultural activities. Grasslands were generally scarce in intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes. The occurrence and siting of traditional rural biotopes in grassland networks vary greatly regionally, abundant and wellconnected traditional rural biotopes being found e.g. in river valleys and few isolated biotopes in intensively cultivated or agriculturally marginal, forested regions. Furthermore, the nationwide occurrence of selected butterfly and bird species was positively related to the abundance of grasslands. Overall, grasslands enrich the Finnish agricultural landscape both at the habitat and species level. In addition to species-rich semi-natural grasslands, other low-productive grasslands also hold significant potential in the maintenance of diverse agricultural environments.

Decision-making in land-use and conservation planning requires relevant and good quality information over wide areas, collected in a cost-efficient manner. This study focuses on the use of medium-resolution satellite imagery in landscape level studies of habitat pattern, particularly in fragmented agricultural landscapes. We analysed the suitability of multi-temporal Landsat TM images in habitat mapping, in particular for the discrimination of semi-natural grasslands. The results showed that even patchy agricultural mosaics can be coarsely mapped with Landsat TM and that the use of multi-temporal imagery notably improves the classification results. The best classification result (total accuracy 89%) was achieved with early spring, midsummer and late summer images combined. The classification accuracy for semi-natural grasslands was relatively low overall (63%), but over 90% of large (&gt; 1 ha) patches were discriminated. Furthermore, we compared a set of landscape composition and structure indices calculated from 1) a Landsat TM -based habitat classification (25 m resolution) and 2) a habitat map derived from aerial photographs (2 m resolution). The compositional indices, diversity index and patch sizes gave similar results on both scales. Finally, the habitat pattern of the study area was described using the calculated compositional, structural and environmental indices, and three main landscape types were identified.
