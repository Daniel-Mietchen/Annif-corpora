ERASMUS PROGRAMME STUDENT’S CHALLENGES FACED ABROAD AND THE IMPACT ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION OBJECTIVES
The organisations of higher education are constantly changing. Universities,  colleges, private schools and online universities refine their pedagogical  methods and learning models in a competitive market. This article is a study  on whether one such model helps students to gain new knowledge. A study  of the LAB studio model (LSM), which is a pedagogical model developing  connections between working-life based problems and the recognition and  development of business-related prototypes and start-up companies, is presented.  The LSM, theoretically grounded in a constructivist view of learning  with a project-based education at its core, has the key goal of educating  entrepreneurial competences in higher education. Based on the case study,  comprising a literature review of knowledge creation and a survey, the qualitative  results analysis suggests that LSM offers a promising support for knowledge  creation. The results lead to the conclusion that LSM provides support  especially for the various modes of the SECI model, such as socialisation  and internalisation, and seems to support organisational knowledge creation  aspects as well.

In Finland, the Pedagogical Studies for Vocational Teachers include 10 credits of studies in education. Half of our  students complete them in connection with the pedagogical studies for teachers. The training consisting of distance  education has been traditionally bought from the University. Some of the students have felt that studying education  according to the university requirements has been hard for them. They would like a more practical approach to  educational studies. Our students also come from a large area in northern Finland. Therefore, an opportunity for  distance education is important for them. Tutoring has an important role in this implementation. To respond to these  challenges, we have designed a more practical implementation of the educational studies, in which the students only  have two face-to-face days. The new implementation was piloted in the autumn term 2012. The pilot succeeded very  well. Students liked to study and learnt a lot about the different areas of education. The study was continued in the  Spring 2014. Students of Education (19 )made the same pre and post-surveys like in the Pilot. Research results were  quite similar than in Pilot study.

The boundaries around the categories of student, migrant and worker have become increasingly fuzzy, as international students are often engaged not just in education, but also in high stakes and expensive journeys towards gaining permanent migration status. This book unpacks the social and political consequences of this education-migration nexus, the uneasy intersection between international education and skilled migration policies that has developed in many Western migrant-receiving nations. The book shows how the nexus has given rise to a new and unique form of transnational migrant: the student-migrant. The book examines student-migrants in terms of their transnationalism and in terms of their relationship to the state, and provides a detailed overview of policy development in concert with an analysis of student-migrants' lived experience. In doing so, it paints a vivid picture of how the macro-politics of state policy intersect with the micro-politics of migrants' transnational social practices.

Currently e-learning is considered an essential part of the everyday learning processes for both teachers and students in higher education. However, the learning results of e-learning are under debate and there is a growing critique on the efficiency and actual results of e-learning. In this paper we present our on-going work for exploring higher education students and teachers recent perceptions of their e-learning experiences, the usage of e-learning technologies and developing the learning process. Two surveys were conducted in order to investigate and compare the perceived advantages, challenges and needs for support among the students and teachers in higher education.  According to the results the perceived advantages of e-learning for both teachers and students were fairly similar. Flexibility in use of time and place were found as the most important benefit of e-learning. Some teachers conceived that e-learning was more activating than traditional learning in terms of increasing presence and participation. However, the results indicate that some of the students were not convinced about the activating advantages of e-learning.   The main challenges in e-learning for both students and teachers dealt with technical issues, (i.e. non-functioning data connections and software) and teacher-student interaction. Both students and teachers also experienced problems in directing the learning situation (e.g. finding/raising motivation, taking possible learning hindrances into account). Teachers also highlighted the students¿ lack of commitment as a challenge in e-learning.  Based on the studies we suggest that in order to ensure the high-quality learning results in e-learning continuous and relevant training and peer support for educators and students are needed. Additionally it is important to enhance the user experience and the content and materials of the courses should be designed carefully. We also suggest that in e-learning the interaction between teachers and peer students should be improved.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to conduct an evaluation study based on the feedback from former students with immigrant background of the English Degree Program in Social Services (DPSS) with the help of interviews. The idea of the evaluation was to harness what elements in the curriculum of the degree program had been useful during the studies and for later working life. The evaluation study was divided into three parts including their feedback on the study curriculum, studying in a multicultural environment and experiences on the process towards working life. A qualitative approach was used in carrying out the study. Semi structured interviews were used in collecting data. The study was focused on the individuals experiences and personal opinions in order for it to be able to provide a detailed feedback for the working life partner. Former students of the English degree program with immigrant background were contacted and six interviews were used for this study including two teacher interviews. The findings showed that the curriculum and the multicultural study environment generally played a supportive role for the former students of the DPSS. Work placements were regarded as the most beneficial element of the curriculum regarding employment opportunities in Finland. In conclusion, the results indicate that although there was a certain amount of dissatisfaction regarding the English language skills used in teaching, students were generally satisfied. The students were mainly motivated about getting a bachelor's certificate since they knew that the degree program will provide them one.

Women returning to higher education
This report is the result of a research project that explored the experiences of deaf students in Higher Education in Scotland. The authors detail current access provisions, and determine the extent to which deaf students have full access to Higher Education. They take a principled approach, noting that issues facing deaf students in Higher Education are best understood and addressed through a framework that foregrounds the linguistic rights that all deaf students (including those who use English and those who use British Sign Language) have to access; rights that are expressed in recent policy developments. Current challenges to policy, and issues in funding and practice are addressed in this report, and it concludes with a full list of recommendations that cohere around the central notion of linguistic access rights. The research was based on extensive interviews with deaf students, sector service providers and stakeholders, and included a comprehensive review of policy and practice in Scotland. It was carried out in 20022003 by a team of researchers in Moray House School of Education at the University of Edinburgh.
Learning with digital games : a practical guide to engaging students in higher education
No single book currently available in either the U.K. or the U.S. brings together such a blend of theory, research and practice in relation to the support of deaf students in higher education. The range of contributors, their national and international reputations in this field, and the innovative nature of the diverse materials gathered here will ensure this volumes place as an indispensable resource. Focusing predominantly on the U.K., this book will also be relevant to a wider international audience in a field seeking to establish global networks. The model of support developing in the U.K. and described in these chapters, represents a significant shift in practice, from that founded on the now widely discredited medical perspective, to one reflecting a social framework. In the U.S., the catalyst for this change has been the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, whilst in the U.K., this shift is mirrored in the Disability Discrimination Act, 1995, most notably within Part IV (Special Educational Needs and Disability Act :2001, enforced 2002), which requires educational institutions to monitor entry, progression and outcomes for deaf students. In the wake of this, it is expected that deaf students will enter a wider range of institutions in increasing numbers. The consequent demand for these establishments to become inclusive, proactive, consultative and anticipatory in their support for deaf students will ensure that this book is welcomed as comprehensive and essential reading. With contributions from researchers and practitioners, and including personal testimony from undergraduate and postgraduate deaf students, this volume offers illuminating and fresh perspectives on the many elements of good practice and quality provision.

Traditionally, deaf education has been treated as the domain of special educators who strive to overcome the difficulties associated with hearing loss. Recently, the sociocultural view of deafness has prompted research and academic study of Deaf culture, sign language linguistics, and bilingual education. Linda Komesaroff exposes the power of the entrenched dominant groups and their influence on the politics of educational policy and practice in Disabling Pedagogy: Power, Politics, and Deaf Education. Komesaroff suggests a reconstruction of deaf education based on educational and social theory. First, she establishes a deep and situated account of deaf education in Australia through interviews with teachers, Deaf leaders, parents, and other stakeholders. Komesaroff then documents a shift to bilingual education by one school community as part of her ethnographic study of language practices in deaf education. She also reports on the experiences of deaf students in teacher education. Her study provides an analytical account of legal cases and discrimination suits brought by deaf parents for lack of access to native sign language in the classroom. Komesaroff confronts the issue of cochlear implantation, locating it within the broader context of gene technology and bioethics, and advocates linguistic rights and self-determination for deaf people on the international level. Disabling Pedagogy concludes with a realistic assessment of the political challenge and the potential of the Deaf Resurgence movement to enfranchise deaf people in the politics of their own education.

During the recent years blended learning has become more common strategy in higher education. In Oulu University of Applied Sciences School of Business and Information Management blended learning was developed in a project where about 20 teachers from two degree programs developed courses from the point of view of individual, blended and online learning. A focus group interview was organised with voluntary students in order to get insights to student's experiences.     Students wish that they would have activities and feedback along the course - not big assignments or exam at the end of the course. Blended learning should be tied to real life cases which are connected to theories. Two-way interaction plays a critical role when blended learning is used in order to avoid the isolation of students. Learning Cafe type of assignments, where talented students' expertise could be used in coaching, received excellent feedback because of the better interaction.
