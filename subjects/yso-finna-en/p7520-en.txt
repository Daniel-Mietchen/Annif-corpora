Liberating leadership : practical styles for pastoral ministry
Existing congregations and denominations are so addicted to self-destructive practices that they cannot change until they admit their bondage. These practices include a hunt for doctrinal purity on the theological right, and a desire for political justice on the theological left. The answer is a complete systemic transformation of congregation or denomination, and consultant Tom Bandy offers twenty shocking truths that thriving churches have discovered. Tom Bandy helps addicted churches kick their habits with the deconstruction of the existing system, followed by an emphasis on small group ministry, multi-track worship experiences, the retraining of enabling pastors, and an abiding, relentless sensitivity toward people who are seeking a Higher Power but who have lost patience with conflicted, self-absorbed religious institutions. He argues in the final chapter, on a theology of the thriving church, that the gospel offers the culture "welcome relief," and not "good news.".

Introduction to recreation and leisure services
How did average Romans live out each year, conduct their family life, rear and educate their children? What about slaves in the household? How did people enjoy themselves--did they travel or go to the theater? And, how were those famed gladiators trained? From a wide variety of sources--writers, inscriptions, papyri, mosaics, stones, even graffiti--the answers to these question come into sharp relief.
