Patients with orofacial clefts must overcome problems associated with their deformity including multiple surgeries, facial scarring, speech difficulties, dental problems and hearing loss. This study considered dental and hearing problems faced by cleft lip and palate patients in Northern Finland. The research aimed to determine prevalence of dental anomalies in cleft children, assess restorative treatment need and examine dental treatment necessary under general anesthesia. Other aims were to identify middle ear problems, need for ventilation tubes (VTs) among cleft children and examine the relationship between cleft severity, palatoplasty technique and hearing outcomes in cleft children aged between 3 and 9-years.The material comprised 214 cleft patients treated at Oulu University Hospital. In the dental study 26.6% had at least one dental anomaly while 17.9% had 2 or 3, most commonly missing or supernumerary teeth. In the general anesthesia study 11.5% had a syndrome and 52.4% of those with a syndrome aged 6-years-old needed restorative treatment. General anesthesia was required for dental treatment in 17.5% of cleft patients, mostly in those with a syndrome. In the middle ear study 79% had secretions in the middle ear during the study period. On average 3 VTs were placed in each patient. The prevalence of tympanic perforation was 35.9% and cholesteatoma occurred in 3.3%. In the hearing study pure tone average did not significantly differ between right and left ears and was unrelated to cleft severity or palatoplasty technique. Based on the dental study the severity of clefting increased with the prevalence of dental anomalies. The general anesthesia study found that need for restorations increased with cleft severity. The presence of a syndrome increased the need for dental treatment under general anesthesia. The middle ear study found that patients with cleft lipand palate and isolated cleft palate had more extensive clefts affecting Eustachian tube function with more frequent middle ear problems requiring more VTs than isolated cleft lip patients. Continuous presence of VTs increased the prevalence of tympanic perforation and cholesteatoma. The hearing study concluded that most of the 3 to 9 year-old cleft patients had normal hearing thresholds unaffected by cleft severity or palatoplasty technique.

"Based on more than 30 years experience and over 20,000 clinical cases, the second edition of Middle Ear and Mastoid Microsurgery presents detailed, step-by-step procedures for the full spectrum of otologic disorders, from assessment and preoperative considerations to descriptions of both common and complex surgeries. The superb intraoperative images and schematic drawings, combined with instructional text, facilitate an in-depth understanding of surgical anatomy and operative steps that is unparalleled in the literature. New to the second edition of this landmark text: Nearly 1,800 vivid, full-color intraoperative images that take readers through every operative sequence and offer a unified management approach to all procedures expanded chapter on temporal bone anatomy and dissection with CT scans correlated to dissection images of normal temporal bone, which is crucial for a full understanding of surgical anatomy and 3-D relationships between important structures. Updated chapter on paragangliomas, offering proven surgical solutions to this difficult pathology. Revised section on hemipetrosectomy, with treatments for intractable otorrhea in dead ears and other severe pathologies widely infiltrating the middle ear. Overview of new approaches to glomus tumor surgery. Coverage of the remarkable advances in cochlear implant technology for profound sensorineural hearing loss Complete with general operating room principles, anesthesia, and technical considerations, plus guidance, pitfalls, problems and potential complications, this comprehensive book is an in-depth review of modern middle ear surgery. From temporal bone anatomy to canalplasty to stapes surgery, it sets the standard as the authoritative, one-stop reference for all otologic surgeons, residents, and medical students"--Provided by publisher.
