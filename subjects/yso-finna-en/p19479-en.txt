Stone tower : the political theater of Arthur Miller
"Citizenship is a contested term which today inspires both policy-makers and radical activists. David Wiles traces this ideal to its classical roots, examining both theatre and citizenship as performative practices. Wiles examines how people function collectively rather than as individuals, for example through choruses or crowd behaviour in the auditorium. He explores historic tensions between the passivity of the spectator and the active engagement of a citizen, paying special attention to dramatists like Aristophanes, Machiavelli and Rousseau who have translated political theory into a theatre of, and for, active citizens. The book is a fresh investigation of familiar and less familiar landmarks of theatre history, revealing how plays function as social and political events. In this original approach to theatre history, Wiles argues that theatre is a powerful medium to build communities, and that attempts to use it as a vehicle for education are very often misplaced"--

This book offers a revealing look at Arthur Miller's political sensibilities as evidenced in his dramatic works and other writings.For more than five decades critics have acclaimed Arthur Miller as a social dramatist. Jeffrey D. Mason's "Stone Tower" offers a fresh appraisal of Miller that clearly establishes him as an essentially political playwright. By taking a closer look at the public and private power relations in Miller's plays and his non-dramatic writings, Mason sets out to enrich - and challenge - traditional views of Miller.The book begins with a detailed critique of Miller's 1956 testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and of his political essays, then moves on to explore Miller's plays, from "All My Sons" and "Death of a Salesman" to "Resurrection Blues" and "The Ride Down Mt. Morgan". Mason provides invaluable new insights on such topics as Miller's mistrust of authority and social power, his theatrical response to the Holocaust, and his treatment of women. With attention to staging issues, social history, and dramatic analysis, the book explores the impact of this canonical American dramatist and breaks new ground in Miller studies.
