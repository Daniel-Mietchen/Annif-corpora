"The landscape of higher education has dramatically altered in the past 30 years as more students are attending universities and colleges than ever before. In such a competitive market, the quality of the student experience is pivotal to an institution's ability to attract students. However, the increasing costs of delivering HE teamed with a reduction in government funding means that creating a high standard of student experience has never been more challenging. The Student Experience 'Practitioner Model' discussed in this book recognises the need of staff at all levels who are developing and implementing initiatives to improve and enhance the student experience. It provides an organised and detailed structure that can be orchestrated in a cost effective and highly adaptable manner. It guides Practitioners in the identification of what they must deliver, who it is delivered to and when they need to deliver by working through the six key stages of the new student lifecycle: - First Contact and Admissions; - Pre-arrival; - Arrival and Orientation; - Induction to Study; - Reorientation and Reinduction (Returners Induction) - Outduction (preparation for life after undergraduate study). -- Provided by publisher.
