"Hospital-Based Palliative Medicine: A Practical, Evidence-Based Approach focuses on improving a Hospitalist's ability to provide quality palliative care in the inpatient hospital setting. Although several large textbooks exist for the palliative care provider, there are few detailed resources aimed specifically at the general Hospitalist and hospital-based staff. Existing textbooks dedicate at most only one chapter to palliative care and they lack the detail and specificity in symptom management and communication skills to truly guide care. Hospital-Based Palliative Medicine addresses each of the major components involved in the delivery of inpatient palliative care. These include the management of complex symptoms and the use of specific communication techniques - right down to the actual words to say to the patient - to convey important information such as the reason for and use of medication and how to handle difficult topics with patients and their families and caregivers. The book's authors are all leaders in the field of palliative care, and most of them also practice as hospitalists, and thus understand both perspectives. Chapters are presented in a consistent format with particular attention to both clinical pearls and pitfalls, making the material practical and easily accessible to the busy hospitalist and associated hospital staff"--Provided by publisher.

Facing death belongs strongly to field of nursing. Terminally ill patients require holistic care which can be referred as palliative care. One important part of this kind of care is communicating about imminence of death and dying. This communicational relationship has not been greatly studied previously. In this thesis, nurses' means, manners, abilities, and willingness to discuss about death and dying were explored. Study approach was qualitative. Theme interviews were conducted with, all together, six nurses of palliative care unit of Tampere University Hospital. Qualitative content analysis was exerted.  Discussing about sensitive subjects such as death and dying was viewed challenging. It was discovered that the nurses of palliative care were willing to talk about death and dying with the terminally ill, but lack of time greatly influenced this issue among other factors. Nurses possessed different means by which these conversations could be supported such as physical touch. Personal coping of the nurses developed its own field of study. This subject could be researched further, for example, how the issue of lacking time could be improved. As it was also discovered, nurses had not gained adequate information about the subject in their basic training. It could be useful to study Finnish nursing education concerning care of the dying.  Key words: death and dying, palliative care, communication.

"With the world's population getting increasingly older, there has never been a more pressing need for the study of old age and ageing. An Introduction to Gerontology provides a wide-ranging introduction to this important topic. By assuming no prior expert knowledge and avoiding jargon, this book will guide students through all the main subjects in gerontology, covering both traditional areas, such as biological and social ageing, as well as more contemporary areas, such as technology, the arts, sexuality and education of older adults. An Introduction to Gerontology is written by a team of international authors with multidisciplinary backgrounds who draw evidence from a variety of different perspectives and traditions".

"Alleviation, rehabilitation and participation are the cornerstones not only of palliative care but also physiotherapy. Hence it is hardly surprising that physiotherapists are indisputable sources of strength to patients with life-limiting illnesses. This book is the first of its kind to paint a comprehensive picture of the concepts and vision of palliative physiotherapy from both an authoritative and empathetic perspective. From paediatrics to geriatrics, from the early stages of a disease to the terminal phase, international experts provide a structured guide to the wide-ranging possibilities that physiotherapy has to offer as part of end of life care. Comprehensive advice as well as practical tips can be found in case studies and personal accounts. Insight is provided to clinical and non-clinical aspects as well as appropriate contextual information, for example: common symptoms such as pain, breathlessness, oedema, fatigue, weakness, anxiety or dementia; medication, symptoms of cord compression and palliative care emergencies; special features of paediatric palliative care; communication with patients and their families; ethics, intercultural proficiency and spirituality; opportunities for therapist self-care. This is a book for all those (not only in hospices and palliative care units) faced with caring for critically ill and terminally ill patients - essential reading for a professional, considered approach." -- (takakansi)

Populations around the world are ageing, and more people are living with the effects of serious chronic illness towards the end of life. Meeting their needs presents a public health challenge. This publication aims to provide examples of better palliative care practices for older people to help those involved in planning and supporting care-oriented services most appropriately and effectively. Examples have been identified from literature searches and from an international call for examples through various organizations, including the European Association of Palliative Care and the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society. Some examples consider how to improve aspects within the whole health system; specific smaller examples consider how to improve palliative care education, support in the community, in hospitals or for specific groups of people, such as people in nursing homes and people with dementia and their families. Some examples await rigorous evaluation of effectiveness, and more research is needed in this field, especially the cost‚Äìeffectiveness and generalizability of these initiatives. This publication takes both an individual person and a health systems approach, focusing on examples from or relevant to the WHO European Region. The publication is intended for policy-makers, decision-makers, planners and multidisciplinary professionals concerned with the care and quality of life of older people.
