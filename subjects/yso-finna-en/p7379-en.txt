The Handbook of Adult Language Disorders is the essential guide to the scientific and clinical tenets of aphasia study and treatment. It focuses on how language breaks down after focal brain damage, what patterns of impairment reveal about normal language, and how recovery can be optimally facilitated. It is unique in that it reviews studies from the major disciplines in which aphasia research is conducted―cognitive neuropsychology, linguistics, neurology, neuroimaging, and speech-language pathology―as they apply to each topic of language. For each language domain, there are chapters devoted to theory and models of the language task, the neural basis of the language task (focusing on recent neuroimaging studies) and clinical diagnosis and treatment of impairments in that domain. In addition, there is broad coverage of approaches to investigation and treatment from leading experts, with several authors specializing in two or more disciplines. This second edition focuses on characterizing the cognitive and neural processes that account for each variant of aphasia as a first step toward developing effective rehabilitation, given that aphasia is one of the most common and disabling consequences of stroke.

The first study of its kind, Regional Variation in Written American English takes a corpus-based approach to map over a hundred grammatical alternation variables across the United States. A multivariate spatial analysis of these maps shows that grammatical alternation variables follow a relatively small number of common regional patterns in American English, which can be explained based on both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors. Based on this rigorous analysis of extensive data, Grieve identifies five primary modern American dialect regions, demonstrating that regional variation is far more pervasive and complex in natural language than is generally assumed. The wealth of maps and data and the groundbreaking implications of this volume make it essential reading for students and researchers in linguistics, English language, geography, computer science, sociology and communication studies.

The arrival of the Reformation was the decisive impetus for literary development in Finland. The principle of Lutheranism was that the people had to get to hear and read the word of God in their own mother tongue. If there previously was no literary language, it had to be created. The first Finnish books were produced by Mikael Agricola. He was born an ordinary son of a farmer, but his dedication to his studies opened up the road to leading roles in the Finnish Church. He was able to bring a total of nine works in Finnish to print, which became the foundation of literary Finnish. This book describes the historical background of Mikael Agricola, his life, his personal networks, the Finnish works published by Agricola, research on Agricola and Agricolas role in contemporary Finnish culture. The most extensive chapter is a depiction of Agricolas Finnish. The book was written with a broad audience in mind, as a work of non-fiction for anyone interested in these subjects.
