Abstract.
This thesis studies suppliers' problems of meeting the technical requirements of hatch cover drive chains. The chains have technical requirements for corrosion resistance, elongation tolerances, surface hardness, breaking load limit and the surface wear resistance of the coating. The main problem with the chain suppliers has been to manufacture a hot-dip galvanized chain that can match the requirements given for elongation and breaking load limits. Hot-dip galvanization, mechanical galvanization processes as well as the manufacturing process of the chain were studied in the theory part of this thesis. Also the requirements were considered to see if they have been set too high. Three different types of chains were compared in the practical part of this thesis. One of these is a hot-dip galvanized chain currently in use, one is a hot-dip galvanized chain from a new chain supplier and one is a mechanically galvanized chain. The elongation and breaking load of the chains were tested using a universal testing machine. The elongation was tested by setting different forces and measuring the elongation. The breaking load limit was tested with the same test machine by stretching the chain until it breaks. A Rockwell testing method and testing device was used for measuring the surface hardness. The surface wear resistance and corrosion resistance were tested by first driving the chain in a testing machine which causes friction to the chain and thus wears the coating. The corrosion resistance properties were tested after the surface wear test by a salt spray test. The surface wear is seen by corrosion in the parts of the chain where the coating has been worn. The result of the tests was that both of the hot-dip galvanized chains met all the re-evaluated requirements while the mechanically galvanized chain lacked the properties for surface wear resistance.

This book extensively covers the different types of biomass (e.g. molasses, sugar beet pulp, cheese whey, sugarcane residues, palm waste, vegetable oil, straws, stalks and wood), various pretreatment approaches (e.g. physical, thermal, chemical, physicochemical and biological) and methods that show the subsequent production of biofuels and chemicals such as sugars, ethanol, extracellular polysaccharides, biodiesel, gas and oil. In addition to traditional methods such as steam, hot-water, hydrothermal, diluted-acid, organosolv, ozonolysis, sulfite, milling, fungal and bacterial, microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, torrefaction, pelletization, gasification (including biogas) and liquefaction pretreatments, it also introduces and discusses novel techniques such as nano and solid catalysts, organic electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids. This book offers a review of state-of-the-art research and provides guidance for the future paths of developing pretreatment techniques of biomass for biofuels, especially in the fields of biotechnology, microbiology, chemistry, materials science and engineering.

This work presents a method for the fabrication of Li₂MoO₄ ceramics at room-temperature based on utilizing a small amount of water with Li₂MoO₄ powder. The densification of the ceramic takes place during pressing. Thus the shape and size of the final ceramic compact can easily be managed by controlling the mould dimensions and the amount of material. Post-processing at 120 °C is applied to remove residual water from the compact. This post-processing temperature can be chosen to be suitable to the other materials integrated, such as the substrate or electrodes, as long as the post-processing time is adequate to remove the residual water. The dielectric properties (relative permittivity of 5.1 and a loss tangent value of 0.00035 at 9.6 GHz) after optimization of the powder particle size, sample pressing pressure, and post-processing time were similar to those achieved for Li₂MoO₄ ceramics fabricated by sintering at 540 °C.The dielectric properties of Li₂MoO₄ ceramics were also modified using composite methods. For example, an addition of 10 volume-% of BaTiO₃ increased the relative permittivity from 6.4 to 9.7 and the loss tangent value from 0.0006 to 0.011 at 1 GHz. To investigate the thermal dependence of the permittivity, different amounts of rutile TiO₂ were incorporated into a Li₂MoO₄ ceramic matrix fabricated with the method described in this work. As the amount of TiO₂ increased from 10 to 30 volume-%, the thermal coefficient of permittivity decreased from 180 ppm/°C to -170 ppm/°C. The low processing temperature made the fabrication approach introduced here feasible for silver electrode integration without the formation of extra phases, which were observed in sintered samples with similar compositions in another study.A patch antenna was realized utilizing a Li₂MoO₄ ceramic disk fabricated by the room-temperature method. The antenna operating at ~4 GHz showed reasonably good performance. A relative humidity of 80% lowered the resonant frequency by 3.25% from the initial value, and reduced the total and radiation efficiencies of the antenna by ~2 dB. The changes were slowly reversible. Use of a silicone conformal coating reduced the shift of the resonant frequency to 1.26% from the initial value and also reduced the effect on efficiencies to ~1 dB. The use of the coating also speeded up the reversibility of the changes when the humidity was decreased.
