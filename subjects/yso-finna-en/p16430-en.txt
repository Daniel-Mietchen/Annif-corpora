Food chemistry
International cuisine has long conquered our cooking and eating habits. However, regional ingredients and some that were out of fashion for a while are gaining importance again. Accordingly, the range of available domestic and international foods is broad - enriching, but also challenging, as many fruits, herbs, seasonings, fish and meat products are unknown to the consumer.

This study analyzed Japanese senior female consumers' views on supplements and other health food products and their motives for the purchase decision making. The purpose of the study was to find out the personal values that determine the buying behavior of the target segment. Japan is one of the biggest markets of health food products in the world, and its growth potential is remarkable particularly in the markets of senior generations. Since the consuming culture of Japan is fairly female-dominated, the study focused on the senior female consumers in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As the theoretical background, the study employed the concepts of a cognitive and affective system, product knowledge as well as the means-end chain theory that is suitable for consumer behavior research. The core perception of the study was that the consumer marketing should be customer-oriented, in other words, based on the consumer's values and needs. The theories presented in the study were based on the conception that a consumer applies learned emotion and reason to the purchase decision, the bases of which are the personal values, namely the important issues and things for the consumer's life. The empirical part of the study was conducted by qualitative research. In the semi-structured laddering interviews, the sample products of Finnish and Japanese health food products were shown to the interviewees who were then asked repeatedly why the product attributes and the consequences mentioned in the interviews were important to them. The interviews were carried out in Japan with ten informants aged 58-77 during the summer 2008. The data was transcribed and encoded into mainly four product categories: tablets and capsules, dried and powdered berries, liquids and drinks, and teas. The data was analyzed by creating hierarchical value maps for the each product category. The maps illustrated the multi-level influence relations among the product attributes, the consequences, the informants' values, and the consumer environment. The most remarkable finding in the study was that typical supplements in the form of tablets and capsules gave chemical and artificial impression to most of the interviewees. A vegetable based diet and the use of clean produce instead provided a secure feeling to them. Furthermore, the attributes applicable to cooking, such as of powder, gained positive responses in the interviews. Taste and aroma were especially important attributes for the liquids and drinks, whereas teas were easily approachable due to the tea drinking culture of Japan although the Finnish sample tea consisted of unfamiliar ingredients. Family, social life, and work and hobbies were the essential factors for the choice of health food products.
