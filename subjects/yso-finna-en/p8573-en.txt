The objective of the study was to gather information of China's real estate market and local consumer's buying behaviour linked with residential properties in Nanjing. The purpose is to help foreign investors to develop a better understanding of Chinese consumer and its real estate market. The findings will answer the research questions: what is the investment climate of China's real estate market like? And what are the characteristics of consumer's behaviour on purchasing residential properties in Nanjing, China? The theoretical framework is based on the combination of three theories which are PESTE, Five Forces Industry Analysis and Consumer's Buying Behaviour. PESTE analysis gives a general picture of investment climate related to real estate in China. Five forces industry analysis presents close and detailed information of the China's real estate industry. And Consumer's buying behaviour model focuses on the buying decision-making process of consumers, especially the criteria and factors that influence it. The research methodology used was mainly quantitative, primary data was collected by qualitative interviews and a questionnaire. 80 questionnaires were collected and analysed. Secondary data was mainly collected from books, internet web pages and research reports.     The findings show that China's investment climate is positive and China's real estate market has a great potential for development. Price, type, structure, design, location of housing are the main influences on potential buyer's decision making process. Foreign investors need to have suitable marketing strategy based on good knowledge of the current industry situation and major factors which can give great influences on consumer's buying behaviour, in order to cater to targeted buyer's needs and desires for residential properties.  The study suggests foreign investors to 'touch the stone while crossing rive'. It is important for foreign investors to know the trend of the market and understand Chinese consumers' needs and desires for their future residential properties. Investors need to bear in mind to build up and keep a good relationship with suppliers and Chinese authorities within the real estate industry. In addition, in order to enhance investors' competitiveness in terms of penetrating China's real estate market, to establish a good reputation and to have a continuously close monitoring action on the major player's performance are key issues.
In the future, shopping will be greatly influenced by a combination of localization issues, mobile internet at the point of sale, and use of social networks. This book focuses on the ‘SoLoMo synergies’ that arise from this paradigm shift in future shopping, which also promises new and effective marketing options for traditional retailers. It also reflects the current status of research and business practice, analyzing the basic factors of SoLoMo in detail. The importance of Location-based Services (LBS) is elaborated and analyzed in an empirical study using a market based case of kaufDA – a leading German online shopping network. The evidence shows that customers see LBS as an attractive tool and are prepared to change their buying behavior. Though LBS is still in its early stages and its professional longevity remains to be seen, it also promises tremendous potential for the future.

Abstract: On-going change in film consumption - Is online availability disrupting the offline markets? The objective of this study was to look into the online film services in Finland and the theories connected to offering that type of online services. The aim was also to look into these services from the point of view of their disruptiveness to the market. A research was conducted to find out the current status of these online film distributors in Finland from the point of view of the customers. The research was mainly of quantitative nature and it was conducted as an online survey. The survey was answered by 123 people and in addition three persons were interviewed to gather more specific experiences and opinions on certain matters. The research revealed that most of the respondents would be willing to try online film services in the future but only few already had experience in using them. Currently more people seem to rather find films from illegal sources to download or prefer to watch them from DVD's or Blu-rays. The research also gave implications that purchasing content online is not a novelty for people anymore and what seems to keep people from using these online services are preconceptions on, for example, their quality and pricing.

The purpose of the study is to suggest a potential marketing strategy for launching Intel-based mobile broadband dongles for the Russian market. One objective is to identify what should be overall marketing strategy and another objective is to estimate potential demand for the Intel-based mobile broadband dongles. The conceptual framework is based on literature and articles about marketing strategies and consumer behavior. Concepts such as Marketing Mix (4Ps), Brand Image, Perceived Product Quality, Perceived Value, Concern for Price, Concern for Quality and Purchase Intention form the basis of the conceptual model. Leading concept is the purchase intention. Other concepts are the factors influencing the purchase intention. Marketing mix variables are adjusted to achieve the highest purchase intention. Research design is descriptive and quantitative research methods were applied. Primary data were collected using online questionnaire survey and secondary data were extracted from internal secondary sources, such as market reports. Quantitative data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software and Microsoft Excel. The results confirm that Intel brand image, perceived product quality, and a useful set of features positively influence overall purchase intention. But findings showed that the price, 2500 rubles for the Intel-based MBB dongles, was set too high. The results indicated that possible market share for the Intel-based mobile broadband dongles could be up to 16%. The results also suggested how to adjust the marketing mix to appeal to the group of consumers having high purchase intention. In conclusion, research questions were answered, marketing mix recommendations were developed and potential demand was estimated. It shows a potential for the Intel-based mobile broadband dongles. Also research process findings were presented. Using social network for collecting the data can be recommended.

Marketing : a brief introduction
Abstract: Luxury fashion brand influence on student purchase behavior. Fashion is a billion-dollar industry employing millions of people around the world. Due to the democratization of that volatile industry coupled with the economic recession, luxury fashion  brands have struggle to hold their ground against the rise of high street brands like Zara, H&M  and the flood of knockoffs worldwide.  Good looking, well-dressed and rich young like Mark Zuckenburg, Cristiano Ronaldo, etc. add  to the pressure put on young consumers about their appearance by the media. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the influence of luxury fashion brands on young  consumer's, namely young students, purchase behaviour. The investigation was also designed  to elucidate the factors that help the luxury fashion remain profitable despite the economic  downturn. Luxury fashion brands are assumed to have an influential impact on appearance  obsessed millennium youngsters and students who purchase luxury goods for many reasons,  which have been emphasized in this thesis. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used for this thesis. A critical review of existing brand and fashion-related literature, brand-related studies and research articles and an  analysis on the topics with emphasis on luxury fashion brands and consumer buying behaviour  constitute the source of secondary data for this thesis. An online survey targeting young  students constitutes the source of primary data. Luxury fashion with a stress on clothing and  accessories would be the case in order to narrow the study scope. The original research area  planned for this study was too wide and complex, however, the thesis was still able to identify  key factors that might determine the influence of brand selection on young consumer's  (specifically that of students) buying decisions. The research also enables the unfolding of brand loyalty in terms of being either emotional (unconscious) or attitudinal (conscious).

The purpose of this thesis is to study purchasing processes and decision-making choice criteria in public healthcare, especially in central hospitals and municipal health centres. This thesis is made as an assignment from Philips Healthcare, which is a manufacturer and a supplier of the patient monitors studied in this thesis. The aim of this study is to ascertain how these patient monitors are bought and which criteria affect the purchasing decision. This thesis consists of theoretical and empirical sections. The theoretical part covers themes such as the medical device industry, the business-to-business market and the institutional market. The empirical part consists of a study conducted via a telephone questionnaire, which includes both qualitative and quantitative characteristics. The sample of this study consists of 33 interviews, of which 20 are from central hospitals and 13 from municipal health centres. The interviewees included several employees working both in hospitals and purchase offices. The thesis and the interviews were all done during the year 2010. Based on the study, the purchasing of patient monitors usually involves a process, which includes several different phases and participants. Buying processes differ greatly between central hospitals and municipal health centres. The process is more clear and structured in central hospitals, whereas greater variation appeared among health centres. It also appeared that criteria affecting the purchasing decision most often relate to technical qualities, though various economic factors are also taken into consideration. The results correlate to the theory introduced in this thesis. This study can provide some developmental ideas for the sponsoring company, for example from the marketing point of view. This study shows that the sponsoring company should market their patient monitors primarily to head physicians, chief buyers and head nurses, depending on the unit involved. In addition, the sponsoring company should emphasize both technical and qualitative qualities when marketing their monitors.

This can be done by offering a complete set of services. This set of services includes brochures in Russia, house models, interior design, housing management, assistance in financing and after sales actions.

Abstract: The impact of in-store customer service on postpurchase impulse-buying behaviour : a case study based on Gallery, a street fashion store. The purpose of this study is to research how in-store customer service can affect satisfied impulse purchasers' postpurchase behaviour in terms of store returns. The results of this study revealed that in-store customer service can positively affect impulse-buyers' postpurchase evaluations of service, and by increasing the level of in-store service the sales personnel can influence the customers' cognitions, and move an initial impulse purchase into a permanent adoption (Kang & Johnson, 2009). This in return can minimise store returns. This study provides information as to why in-store customer service should be considered as a part of the strategic store environment, and how service-oriented emphasis can influence impulse-buying behaviour.

Abstract: Analysis of Attitudes towards Mobile Direct Marketing Directed to Consumers Involved in Loyalty Programs. The main objective of this dissertation was to analyze general attitudes consumers have towards mobile direct marketing, when it is executed by some company whose loyalty program they are involved in. The study was then investigating the level of interest towards such advertising. The research was based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative research, and an online survey of 94 individuals from different age groups and professions was conducted for data collection purposes. The research aimed at giving generalized view of the consumers' reaction to the topic and suggestions on how this information could be used by any company planning on incorporating mobile direct marketing to their loyalty programs. A critical review of relevant secondary data was carried out to get insight on consumer behavior, when it comes to loyalty programs and mobile direct marketing. The literature review discusses in general terms of the topic related concepts of marketing and consumer behavior, and finishes with introducing the different uses and types of mobile direct marketing. This information gave the basis for primary research. Results of the research placed some of the theory of secondary data under consideration, and further recommendation for research would therefore be focusing on viral activity related to loyalty program messages as well as realization of paid-for ordering service. Limitations of research include the absence of a commissioner, which affects the reliability of the primary research results.

This thesis was developed in order to help the commissionaire, the Microscopy and Nanotechnology Centre at Oulu University (MNT), acquire a better understanding of the current state of the market for material analyses services in Northern Bothnia region. The main purpose of this research paper is, by using applied marketing research tools- a quantitative survey, to collect as much information possible about the customers who are purchasing material analyses in the region. The main research areas have been value creation and customers’ satisfaction, regular customer behaviour and information channels used in the purchasing process. The background analyses included a theory review of B2B marketing and the organizational behaviour in specific. Moreover a SME framework has been drawn, also the buying behaviour in organizations and the value creation has been discussed to provide to the reader a theoretical fundament for the research to come. The conveyed survey managed to successfully attract respondents in order to provide valid answers to the preliminary objectives. The main conclusions have been made in reference with the building ideal material analyses service and in considerations with the future trends on the market. A material service provider that is fast, reliable, cooperative, versatile and experienced has been stated to be the most desired research partner.

Analysis of Attitudes towards Mobile Direct Marketing Directed to Consumers Involved in Loyalty Programs.
This thesis is about the Brand image and buying behavior of fast moving consumer goods brand X in Finland commissioned by company Y which is a multinational company owning the brand among other known brands. The research questions of this study were: “What is the current brand image of brand X in Finland?” and “What makes consumers choose brand X?” The sub-questions handled other branding and consumer behaviour themes to be able to study the brand image and buying behaviour of the brand in Finland. The research method of this study was semi-structured qualitative face-to-face interviewing. The interviews were conducted as part of demo day 12.11.2011 in Citymarket Jumbo in Vantaa, Finland. There were 15 responses gotten from consumers. According to the responses the brand X is seen mainly as treatment product rather than everyday product. The brand was very well known because of strong television advertising which has related to the consumer trust towards the brand. However, the brand was mainly seen as a product only and the respondents were not able to name any other attributes than product attributes. The respondents only mentioned functional benefits regarding the brand. As a conclusion the importance of a brand being more than the product should be taken into account when planning strategies for the brand X. Also the brand identity should communicate more strongly the intended values and use of the brand to be able to attract more consumers and create loyal long term brand-consumer relationship.
