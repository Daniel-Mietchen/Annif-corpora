Ethical considerations have a formidable influence on planning and conducting research. Concerns over the ethical dimensions of behavioral research have risen dramatically, resulting in significant developments in ethical codification and the research review process. The ever-changing nature of the ethical climate in research coincides with the increased sensitivity to ethics in other domains such as those involving global corporations as Enron and WorldCom. An adherence to basic values of integrity represents a fundamental concern for behavioral researchers as we progress through the 21st century. This new edition focuses on the research community's response to current professional and public demands, the issues imposed by new research technologies, and the ethical challenges that arise in the application of research approaches. Additionally, attention is given to some of the ethical issues and conflicts encountered in cross-cultural research, reflecting the increase of fundamental and applied researchers conducting studies in foreign settings.

Since the publication of the sixth edition of this benchmark text, numerous advances in the field have been made - particularly in stem cells, 3D culture, scale-up, STR profiling, and culture of specialized cells. "Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique and Specialized Applications, Seventh Edition" is the updated version of this benchmark text, addressing these recent developments in the field as well as the basic skills and protocols.     This eagerly awaited edition reviews the increasing diversity of the applications of cell culture and the proliferation of specialized techniques, and provides an introduction to new subtopics in mini-reviews. New features also include a new chapter on cell line authentication with a review of the major issues and appropriate protocols including DNA profiling and barcoding, as well as some new specialized protocols. Because of the continuing expansion of cell culture, and to keep the bulk of the book to a reasonable size, some specialized protocols are presented as supplementary material online. "Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique and Specialized Applications, Seventh Edition" provides the most accessible and comprehensive introduction available to the culture and experimental manipulation of animal cells. This text is an indispensable resource for those in or entering the field, including academic research scientists, clinical and biopharmaceutical researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, cell and molecular biology and genetics lab managers, trainees and technicians.

In the shocking sequel to runaway international bestseller"Syndrome E," ""Lucie Henebelle and Inspector Sharko reunite to investigate the brutal murder of Eva Louts, a promising graduate student who was killed while working at a primate research center outside Paris. But what first appears to be a vicious animal attack soon proves to be something more sinister. What was Eva secretly researching? Could she have been on the track of a crazed trio of scientists attempting to unleash a thirty-thousand-year-old virus into the world? With his unmatched ability to inject cutting-edge science into his novels, Thilliez draws on genetics, paleontology, and the dark side of human nature to create this smart, adrenaline-fueled thriller."Bred to Kill"moves from the rain-slicked streets of Paris to the heart of the Alps to the remoteAmazon jungle as Lucie and Sharko work to solve the murder before whoever killed Eva comes for them."
Cleft thorax in Drosophila melanogaster is a morphogenetic defect caused by specific mutations in the pannier (pnr) and ultraspiracle (usp) genes or genes that are components of the JNK pathway. Alternative oxidase (AOX) is able to rescue this defect in certain causes. One hypothesis is that the activator protein 1 (AP-1) could be affected by AOX. The rescue effect of AOX is connected to its capability to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The objective of this thesis was to study the effect of AOX on the JNK pathway and cleft thorax formation in Drosophila melanogaster. The purpose was to analyse whether cleft thorax caused by the knockdown of hep, bsk, d-Fos or d-Jun in pnr-expressing cells can be rescued by AOX. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown different genes of the JNK pathway in pnr-expressing cells and induce cleft thorax in Drosophila. After knockdown, rescue experiments were carried out to test if AOX is capable of rescuing cleft thorax caused by the silenced gene expression. AOX was introduced into the knockdown flies by crossing RNAi, UAS/GAL4 and AOX transgenic fly lines. Here we show that AOX was unable to rescue cleft thorax caused by d-Jun knockdown. Flies with the d-Jun knockdown in the pannier tissue could not complete metamorphosis and died at pupal stage. The same phenotype was observed with in the presence of AOX. Thus, AOX could not rescue the cleft thorax caused by gene knockdown within the JNK pathway. That AOX is unable to rescue the defect caused by the knockdown of these components indicates that these components could be interacting with AOX. In the future, experiments should focus on measuring the level of ROS production, particularly in the thorax, during different developmental stages by using an indicator stain for mitochondrial ROS production. It would also be interesting to discover other genes affecting AOX rescue of cleft thorax through use of RNA sequencing.
