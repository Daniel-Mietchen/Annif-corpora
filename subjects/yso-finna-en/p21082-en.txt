Dynamic systems for everyone : understanding how our world works
Database replication : an overview of replication techniques in common database systems
REST continues to gain momentum as the best method for building web services, leaving many web architects to consider whether and how to include this approach in their SOA and SOAP-dominated world. This book offers a down-to-earth explanation of REST, with techniques and examples that show you how to design and implement integration solutions using the REST architectural style. * Explore several web communications approaches, and discover what makes REST different * Walk through the pros and cons of the RESTful approach * Learn how the underlying architecture of the Web can drastically simplify programming built on top of it * View REST in the context of cloud computing and the Semantic Web * Understand how hypermedia serves as a model for computers to process data.

"The primary purpose of this book is to capture the state-of-the-art in Cloud Computing technologies and applications. The book will also aim to identify potential research directions and technologies that will facilitate creation a global market-place of cloud computing services supporting scientific, industrial, business, and consumer applications. We expect the book to serve as a reference for larger audience such as systems architects, practitioners, developers, new researchers and graduate level students. This area of research is relatively recent, and as such has no existing reference book that addresses it. This book will be a timely contribution to a field that is gaining considerable research interest, momentum, and is expected to be of increasing interest to commercial developers. The book is targeted for professional computer science developers and graduate students especially at Masters level. As Cloud Computing is recognized as one of the top five emerging technologies that will have a major impact on the quality of science and society over the next 20 years, its knowledge will help position our readers at the forefront of the field"--Provided by publisher.

"In the last decade, wireless or wired sensor networks have attracted much attention. However, most designs target general sensor network issues including protocol stack (routing, MAC, etc.) and security issues. This book focuses on the close integration of sensing, networking, and smart signal processing via machine learning. Based on their world-class research, the authors present the fundamentals of intelligent sensor networks. They cover sensing and sampling, distributed signal processing, and intelligent signal learning. In addition, they present cutting-edge research results from leading experts"--

This thesis project was mostly aimed to implement the distributed system using NodeJS with the feature of asynchronous task processing as a driving factor for the applications efficiency. Also a significant amount of time was spent on the client side development for a better usability and UI experience for the users. This application has a significant scope on the current market. It can target at any kind of business from small start-ups to huge corporations and increase their competitiveness on the Internet (search engines) by allowing companies to easily and efficiently get closer to their customers. A running beta version of this application can be found on http://beta.adquanto.com.
This thesis was requested by the HAAGA-HELIA thesis group on databases and the DBTech EXT project for a workshop where one of the topics is database replication. Its purpose was to test and document database replication techniques in most common database systems. The thesis was done in two parts. The first part was a literature research. It was constructed from vendor manuals, handbooks, studies and white papers. Additionally, re-grouping by functionality was done to help out differentiate replication features of vendor database systems. The second part, the empirical part consistsed of series of tests, where database replication was tested in practice using gathered information from the first part. Furthermore, a setup of replication environment using SQL server 2008 was documented. The literature review showed that all database vendors have exclusive replication products. All vendors have their own concepts and terms, which made comparison of features challenging. In the recap of the first part, replication systems were compared by type and functionality rather than per vendor basis. Furthermore, groups were re-named. According to the empirical tests, database replication can be done in various ways and it proved to be effective system to distribute data where it's needed. Moreover, the tests showed the im-portance of planning. The study concludes that, due to the subject complexity and differences in vendor concepts, sufficient theoretical and empirical background is required to plan, implement and maintain replication systems.
