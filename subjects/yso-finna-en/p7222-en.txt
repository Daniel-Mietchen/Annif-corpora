All quests for data integration in architecture and the construction industry lead ultimately to FUSION, a synthesis of knowledge that transcends mere combination. FUSION is the dream of a knowledge system that will enable multiple sets of data, in manifold formats, to be presented in a unified view. The conference theme is Fusion: Data integration at its best. The conference will explore the possibilities for advanced levels of data integration in the service of the representation and management of the natural environment, and the design, visualisation and making of the built environment.

In 1996, Pablo Ventura turned his attention to the choreography software Life Forms to find out whether the then-revolutionary new tool could lead to new possibilities of expression in contemporary dance. During the next 2 decades, he devised choreographic techniques and custom software to create dance works that highlight the operational logic of computers, accompanied by computer-generated dance and media elements. This article provides a firsthand account of how Ventura's engagement with algorithmic concepts guided and transformed his choreographic practice. The text describes the methods that were developed to create computer-aided dance choreographies. Furthermore, the text illustrates how choreography techniques can be applied to correlate formal and aesthetic aspects of movement, music, and video. Finally, the text emphasizes how Ventura's interest in the wider conceptual context has led him to explore with choreographic means fundamental issues concerning the characteristics of humans and machines and their increasingly profound interdependencies..

This paper offers a portrayal of how affective computing and persuasive technologies can converge into an effective tool for interfacing biomedical engineering with behavioral sciences and medicine. We describe the characteristics, features, applications, present state of the art, perspectives, and trends of both streams of research. In particular, these streams are analyzed in light of the potential contribution of their convergence for improving computer-mediated health-care systems, by facilitating the modification of patients' attitudes and behaviors, such as engagement and compliance. We propose a framework for future research in this emerging area, highlighting how key constructs and intervening variables should be considered. Some specific implications and challenges posed by the convergence of these two technologies in health care, such as paradigm change, multimodality, patients' attitude improvement, and cost reduction, are also briefly addressed and discussed.

The theme of this conference is the role of computation in the consideration of performance in planning and design. Since long, a building no longer simply serves to shelter human activity from the natural environment. It must not just defy natural forces, carry its own weight, its occupants and their possessions, it should also functionally facilitate its occupants' activities, be esthetically pleasing, be economical in building and maintenance costs, provide temperature, humidity, lighting and acoustical comfort, be sustainable with respect to material, energy and other resources, and so forth. Considering all these performance aspects in building design is far from straightforward and their integration into the design process further increases complexity, interdisciplinarity and the need for computational support. One of the roles of computation in planning and design is the measurement and prediction of the performances of buildings and cities, where performance denotes the ability of this built environment to meet various technical and non-technical requirements (physical as well as psychological) placed upon them by owners, users and society at large.

This book "focuses on communicating information, not creating information. Developing information which clearly communicates and fits peopleâs needs requires understanding how people think and what drives their decision processes. To help achieve that goal, this book works to provide practical knowledge based on a sound theoretical foundation for allowing people to engage in a meaningful dialogue as they make decisions with respect to designing that communication. Besides being a reference for the academic researcher or practicing technical communicator, it is written so it can be used as a reference for either a foundational or theories of technical communication course."--Provided by publisher.

Human psychology is deeply rooted in the culture in which people live. Introduction to Computational Cultural Psychology introduces a revolutionary approach for studying cultural psychology. Drawing on novel computational tools and in-depth case studies, Professor Yair Neuman offers thought-provoking answers to questions such as: how are thought and language deeply related? How can computers help us to understand different cultures? How can computers assist military intelligence in identifying vengeful intentions? And how is our concept of 'love' rooted in our basic embodied experience? Written by a leading interdisciplinary researcher this book is a 'tour-de-force' which will be of interest to a variety of researchers, students and practitioners in psychology as well as an interdisciplinary audience with an interest in the intricate web weaved between the human psyche and its cultural context. -- Provided by publisher.

More and more historical texts are becoming available in digital form. Digitization of paper documents is motivated by the aim of preserving cultural heritage and making it more accessible, both to laypeople and scholars. As digital images cannot be searched for text, digitization projects increasingly strive to create digital text, which can be searched and otherwise automatically processed, in addition to facsimiles. Indeed, the emerging field of digital humanities heavily relies on the availability of digital text for its studies. Together with the increasing availability of historical texts in digital form, there is a growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and tools to historical texts. However, the specific linguistic properties of historical texts--the lack of standardized orthography in particular--pose special challenges for NLP.
