The goal of this thesis was to develop a test method to determine the barrier properties of polymer substrates for Picodeon Ltd Oy. Picodeon had earlier made tests at 3rd party laboratories to determine barrier properties; the in-house test was developed to accelerate the development work of barrier films. The oil penetration test followed the guidelines of ASTM F119 – 82 standard. In this project the goal was to find the right test parameters for tensioned TPU membrane and to develop the analysis of the results. The gas penetration test was designed to be a fast way to determine the barrier properties of polymer samples and to show improvements on the coating related to porous structure. In this method helium gas was used and detector was Agilent G3388A leak detector. For oil penetration test the right parameters were found and a picture analysis method was developed where the mean gray value of spots from TLC plate was measured. With mean gray value method we were able to follow the progress of penetration through polymer. A specification for oil penetration test was done (Appendix 1). Gas penetration test with Agilent detector was abandoned after first set of tests because the detectors quantitative values and the lack of sensitivity. A new setup for gas penetration was acquired but time ran out to do any testing with the new setup.
