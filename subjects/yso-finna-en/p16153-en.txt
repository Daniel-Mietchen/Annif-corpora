Abstract: Pulse radars are the most common type of radar used because of its versatility and abilities in function. This thesis will be covered from the viewpoint of military and civilian aviation. The thesis will concentrate on the basics of pulse radars and its function. The structure of the pulse radar will be covered in more detail, and also the most common mathematical formulas in radar  technology.  The function of a secondary surveillance radar (SSR) will also be covered in more detail. The purpose of this thesis is to give a basic understanding of radar  technology and pulse radars.
