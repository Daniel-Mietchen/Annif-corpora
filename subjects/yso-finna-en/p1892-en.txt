The disposal of municipal solid waste (MWS) is a  growing problem worldwide because of the increasing  volume of the waste and the negative impact on the  environment, health and safety. Among the combustion  and incineration technologies, fluidized  bed combustion is becoming more popular because of  its ability to handle a variety of waste and  advantages in controlling emission. However,in  the high moisture content wastes with low  calorific value, co-firing wastes with a  supplementary fuel such as coal is being tried in  many industrial and utility boilers. In order to  ensure that these co-firing facilities are properly  designed and operated, a fundamental understanding  of the co-combustion phenomena including its  dynamical characteristics must be established. It  is for this reason a basic study on the co-  combustion of MSW and lignite in a fluidized bed is  proposed. The objectives of this book are to  investigate the effect of main operating parameters  on combustion characteristics, to quantify the  fluctuating characteristics during steady-state  operation using statistical analysis and to create  a linear model obtained from input-output analysis. / Kustantajan esittely.

The main aim of the European Union's waste legislation and the corresponding Finnish waste legislation is to reduce the production of waste. Further, the aims of the European Union's growth strategy are to reduce the production of greenhouse gases, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy efficiency. According to the renewed Waste Tax Act, a waste tax has to be paid on all fly ashes that are deposited in landfills in Finland. A large amount of wood- and peat-based fly ashes are formed annually in Finland, and the amount is likely to increase in the future due to the increasing use of renewable energy. Previously, these ashes have mainly been deposited in industrial landfills, but the need to utilize the fly ashes has increased recently due to changes in waste legislation.In this thesis, several issues related to the utilization of wood- and peat-based fly ash were studied, with the general objective of improving the utilization potential of such ashes.As the first stage of this research, the suitability of willow ash for use as a fertilizer was studied. Willow ash would be well suited for use as a fertilizer due to its very high nutrient content. However, cadmium, a heavy metal, was found to be enriched in the ashes of the studied willow species. Due to this, special attention should be paid when choosing willow species for energy production.In the second stage of the research, the possibility of improving the strength development of wood- and peat-based fly ashes, as well as the possibility of stabilizing fly ash containing high amounts of heavy metals via the addition of cement and/or alkali activation, was investigated. Strength development was found to be dependent on the amount of reactive calcium and the ratio between that amount of reactive calcium and the sum of the reactive silicon, aluminum, and sulfur (Ca/(Si + Al + S)). The studied methodsperformed well in terms of stabilizing barium, copper, lead, and zinc.During the next stage, the effect of different chemical digestion methods, which are regulated by the Finnish waste legislation, on the utilization potential of fly ash was studied. The digestion method had a significant impact on the results of the potassium content analysis, which could affect the possibility of using fly ash as a fertilizer.As the final stage of the research, the co-granulation of ash with sewage sludge and lime was studied. From a technical point of view, the co-granulation was successful, although the compressive strength of the granules was low. Additionally, an insufficient nitrogen content was achieved with a sludge addition of 20-40 weight%.
