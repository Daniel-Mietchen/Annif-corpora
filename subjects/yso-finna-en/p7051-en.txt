Full of essential advice for spotlight lovers and wallflowers alike, this book will teach you how to bring any crowd to its feet. Your day is full of moments when you must persuade, inform, and motivate others. Each of those moments requires you to play a role, to heighten the impact of your words, and to manage your emotions and nerves--if you want to steal the show, that is. Every interaction is a performance, whether you're speaking up in a meeting, pitching a client, or walking into a job interview. Here, best-selling author Michael Port draws on decades of experience as an actor and a popular keynote speaker, to show you how to make the most of every presentation and interaction. You'll learn how the methods of top actors will help you connect with, inspire, and persuade any audience. You'll discover the key strategies for commanding an audience's attention, developing a clear focus for every performance, engaging your listeners, and delivering your message with maximum impact.--Adapted from book jacket.
