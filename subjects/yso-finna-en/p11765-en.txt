Addressing current music therapy debates to do with meaning, this text asks such questions as: are words necessary in creative music therapy?; how is clinical improvization distinct from pure music improvization, and if so what is the distinction?; and how do music therapists address culture-specific nuances in music, and in concepts of healing rituals? The text is divided into three sections. The first section explores concepts and theories developed by music theorists an dmusic psychologists in order to explore meaning in music as artform. The second section looks at the relationship between music and human emotion, in order to establish why, and on what basis, music is used as a therapeutic agent. Finally, the third section draws concepts from psychotherapy and music theory into the music therapy sphere. Music therapists are encouraged not to compromise the musical process at the heart of their practice, not simply to borrow concepts from allied theories, but to use these with authority.

The psychotherapy relationship : Theory, research, and practice
"It has often been assumed that people with developmental disabilities are incapable of expressing or acquiring the level of emotional insight and sensitivity necessary to engage in any kind of therapy. Authentic Dialogue with Persons who are Developmentally Disabled explodes this myth, challenging mental health professionals and families to engage in genuine dialogue with people who are developmentally disabled. Rather than avoiding painful topics, such as awareness of the loss of a normal life, this book shows it is possible to confront these difficult and emotive issues within a therapeutic environment. The author, Jennifer Hill, follows the progress of several developmentally disabled individuals who participated in her group psychotherapy sessions over the course of several months and were able to discuss their feelings of sorrow, grief, jealousy and joy with the group. Offering rare insight into what it means to have a developmental disability from the perspective of those with the condition, Hill suggests a hopeful alternative to many of the programs currently on offer to the developmentally disabled. Thought-provoking and refreshing, this book will be of interest to social workers, psychologists, and educators in the fields of developmental disability and mental health, as well as families of individuals with developmental disabilities." --
