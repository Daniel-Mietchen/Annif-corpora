"Representing the pinnacle of skull base surgery, paraganglioma management requires the advanced surgical skills and expertise that are presented by Dr. Mario Sanna and his team in this comprehensive reference. It incorporates extensive surgical and radiological data compiled over 20 years at the preeminent Gruppo Otologica Clinic in Piacenza, Italy, and features the exquisite intraoperative photographs and schematic diagrams that are a hallmark of the highly regarded Sanna texts. All head and neck and skull base surgeons will find their knowledge, technical proficiency, and ability to manage these challenging tumors vastly increased by this informative resource. Special Features: Step-by-step descriptions of the full range of head and neck paraganglioma procedures, including the infratemporal fossa approach type A, the extreme lateral approach, and the transcervical approach, plus guidance on managing complex tympanojugular paragangliomas More than 1,800 clearly labeled, high-quality intraoperative photographs correlated to full-color schematic drawings for an in-depth understanding of techniques Detailed discussion of managing the internal carotid artery during procedures, including the neuroradiological use of stents Pathology-oriented structure that allows the reader to identify a lesion at a particular stage and then follow the critical thinking, assessment, pre-operative management, and intra-operative course taken by the surgeon Comprehensive sections on pathology, physiology, anatomy, epidemiology, and new genetic breakthroughs that lay the groundwork for the surgical chapters Tips, hints, and pitfalls at the end of each chapter that offer valuable insights for managing different clinical scenarios"--Provided by publisher.

The image of the human skull is a universal icon, common throughout human civilization since time immemorial. "Skullture" takes a comprehensive approach to portraying how the image manifests in contemporary art, design and popular culture. This analysis includes visual and conceptual considerations of the skull throughout history, connecting the dots between Aztec religious iconography, Punk Rock and eighteenth century funerary practices without ever losing sight of the fact that, while fashion my change, the skull remains the same. "Skullture" presents diverse aesthetic uses of the skull as well as its various cultural resonances throughout all disciplines of art and design..

Effects of hyperbaric oxygen on healing of bone, bone grafts and bone graft substitutes in calvarial defects
Bone is a highly vascularized tissue which enables a close interaction between blood vessels and osteoid complexes, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Iatrogenic bone loss, caused by a surgical intervention or trauma, disrupts circulation in the bone and leads to hypoxia and even necrosis of the adjacent bone. The mechanisms of the bone tissue healing process by regeneration are highly specific.The most common and predictable way to manage a large-sized skull bone defect has traditionally been using the patient's own bone tissue graft. The problem with the method is damage and pain of the donor site caused by the operation and healing problems. In paediatric patients, there is a limited availability of adequate autologous bone grafts. For this reason, efforts have been made to develop substitute materials in order to avoid the need for large bone grafts. Autologous stem cells have proven to be promising targets for the development of bone substitutes for cranio-maxillofacial bone defects.The main objective of this study was to examine, by using an experimental animal model, differences in the healing of critical-sized calvarial bone defects, similar to cranioplasty, induced with different types of autogenous bone grafts and with adipose tissue- or bone marrow-derived stem cells grown in two commonly used biomaterials, tricalcium phosphate and bioglass. We also investigated the effect of tissue adhesive, fibrin glue, on the healing process of bone defects. The effect of the stimulating growth factor proteins BMP-2, BMP-7 and VEGF on tissue transplants and ossification was also studied. The results of this study support the previously reported findings of accelerated bone graft resorption associated with autologous bone graft use. In particular, the use of fibrin tissue glue in combination with autologous particulated bone grafts reduced the formation of new bone incalvarial lesions.During the initial healing of calvarial bone defects, tricalcium phosphate granules proved to be more effective than solid bioactive glass scaffolds. Furthermore, in combination with adipose-derived stem cells, tricalcium phosphate showed better bone regeneration than the same cells in combination with a bioactive glass scaffold. Combining bone marrow-derived stem cells with biomaterial did not increase bone formation in calvarial critical-sized defects. In this study, there was no evidence of the positive effect of growth factors on cranial bone healing.

This book documents how the many components of the head function, how they evolved since we diverged from the apes, and how they interact in diverse ways both functionally and developmentally, causing them to be highly integrated.
