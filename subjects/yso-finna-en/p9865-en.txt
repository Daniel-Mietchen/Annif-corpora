This book provides an introduction to numerical computing from the viewpoint of backward error analysis. The intended audience includes students and researchers in science, engineering and mathematics. The approach taken is somewhat informal owing to the wide variety of backgrounds of the readers, but the central ideas of backward error and sensitivity (conditioning) are systematically emphasized. The book is divided into four parts: Part I provides the background preliminaries including floating-point arithmetic, polynomials and computer evaluation of functions; Part II covers numerical linear algebra; Part III covers interpolation, the FFT and quadrature; and Part IV covers numerical solutions of differential equations including initial-value problems, boundary-value problems, delay differential equations and a brief chapter on partial differential equations. The book contains detailed illustrations, chapter summaries and a variety of exercises as well some Matlab codes provided online as supplementary material.
Most of the many books on finite elements are devoted either to mathematical theory or to engineering applications, but not to both. This book seeks to bridge the gap by presenting the main theoretical ideas of the finite element method and the analysis of its errors in an accessible way. At the same time it presents computed numbers which not only illustrate the theory but can only be analysed using the theory. This approach, both dual and interacting between theory and computation makes this book unique. Much research is currently being done into reliability in computational modelling, involving both validation of the mathematical models and verification of the numerical schemes. By treating finite element error analysis in this way this book is a significant contribution to the verification process of finite element modelling in the context of reliability.

Summary.
"Written by one of the foremost experts in high-performance computing and the inventor of Gustafson's Law, The End of Error: Unum Computing explains a new approach to computer arithmetic: the universal number (unum). The unum encompasses all IEEE floating-point formats as well as fixed-point and exact integer arithmetic. This new number type obtains more accurate answers than floating-point arithmetic yet uses fewer bits in many cases, saving memory, bandwidth, energy, and power. Richly illustrated in color, this groundbreaking book is accessible to anyone who uses computers for technical calculations."--
