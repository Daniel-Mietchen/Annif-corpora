Identifies key historical moments in the birth and evolution of nanoscience Based on interviews with 50 scientists and engineers engaged in nanoscale research in France and in the United States Describes transformations in the relations between instrumentation, materials, research questions, and epistemology in the domains of nanoscale research Over the course of the last thirty years, the investigation of objects at the nano scale has rocketed. Nanoscale scientific research has not only powerfully affected the amount and orientation of knowledge, it has perhaps even more significantly redirected the ways in which much research work is carried out, changed scientists' methodology and reasoning processes, and influenced aspects of the structure of career trajectory and the functioning of scientific disciplines. This book identifies key historical moments and episodes in the birth and evolution of nanoscience, discusses the novel repertory of epistemological concerns of practitioners, and signals sociological propensities. As Galileo's telescope explored the moon's surface four hundred years ago, nano instrumentation now makes it possible to see the surface of single molecules. Moreover, practitioners are able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules at will to produce pre-designed synthetic materials, non-existent in nature. The combinatorial of heightened observational capacity and the tailoring of synthetic artificial materials exhibiting hitherto novel physical properties has widened and transformed the worlds of scientific knowledge and technical artefact. This book invites the question: to what extent does nanoscale scientific research constitute a kind of 'scientific revolution'?

This paper is a theoretical study; it was made to present a new technology known as nanotechnology. More particularly, it will focus on nanomaterials. The thesis was based on a personal interest in the subject. Initially, a lot of theory about nanotechnology was gathered. The resources of data were obtained on the Internet. The first part of thesis deals with the history of nanotechnology and its importance. The remainder of the work deals with nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes, their applications and use. Of conclusion is drawn that nanotechnology development will move relatively straightforward, but the goal is just a matter of time. Clearly, nanotechnology will impact every part of life. The manufacturers of nanotools are the special, complex field of nanotechnology. This field of industry has a good future opportunity to move forward. The range of future applications of nanomaterials is wide. The early applications areas are painting, coating and drug delivery. Automotive applications are moving forward and there demand through the industry is beginning to increase, as in the electronics and health industries. The medical field has the widest range of applications at present and the future presents potential.

While many books are dedicated to individual aspects of nanofabrication, there is no single source that defines and explains the total vision of the field. Filling this gap, Nanofabrication Handbook presents a unique collection of new and the most important established approaches to nanofabrication. Contributors from leading research facilities and academic institutions around the world define subfields, offer practical instructions and examples, and pave the way for future research. Helping readers to select the proper fabricating technique for their experiments, the book provides a broad vision of the most critical problems and explains how to solve them. It includes basic definitions and introduces the main underlying concepts of nanofabrication. The book also discusses the major advantages and disadvantages of each approach and offers a wide variety of examples of cutting-edge applications. Each chapter focuses on a particular method or aspect of study. For every method, the contributors describe the underlying theoretical basis, resolution, patterns and substrates used, and applications. They show how applications at the nanoscale require a different process and understanding than those at the microscale. For each experiment, they elucidate key solutions to problems relating to materials, methods, and surface considerations. A complete resource for this rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field, this handbook provides practical information for planning the experiments of any project that employs nanofabrication techniques. It gives readers a foundation to enter the complex world of nanofabrication and inspires the scientific community at large to push the limits of nanometer resolution.
