Abstract.
Magnetic fields and leukemia : risk for adults living close to power lines
Magnetics design handbook
This comprehensive text covers fundamental wave propagation behaviours and computational techniques for waves in inhomogeneous media. It should be of value to students and researchers in electromagnetic wave theory, and to engineers, physicists, and geophysicists involved in remote sensing.
