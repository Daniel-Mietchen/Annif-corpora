The aim for this thesis was to do research on St. Petersburg business environment concerning especially craft beer retail/wholesale markets, culture and business viability for MAKU for entering the markets as soon and as smoothly as possible. The study and its suggestions were based on relevant international marketing literature and two face-to-face interviews with Russian market/business environment specialists. Majority of the references, however, came from articles and news on the Internet, because those generally are the most up-to-date sources. The initial purpose of the thesis was to conduct a practical plan for MAKU on where to begin, gather possible client and partner information for them to start their business venture, what to expect from Russian business field (legally and culturally), and how to manage and cope with that environment. I performed a quite extensive research on the St. Petersburg business environment. The interviews I conducted steered my way into researching the political and economic environment of St. Petersburg's markets more in-depth than I was originally supposed to. PESTL analysis was my central structure which my references - literature, interviews, and web articles - supported. The thesis also includes sections of market environment study, socio-cultural, technological, legal and competitive aspects and finally a comparison of the three most feasible foreign market entry strategies in regard of MAKU Brewing's needs and current capabilities. Based on my findings throughout the thesis I now find my expectations were very high on how MAKU would be able to enter the markets with great ease. My original thoughts of St. Petersburg as a potential expansion market for MAKU were rationalized during my research. The main suggestion for MAKU was an topic that was against my original hypothesis. I came into the conclusion that it is not a good plan to try to penetrate the market with the schedule MAKU had in mind. With my findings it would take persistence and probably years to do the groundwork needed for a project of this scale - not months. The current political and economic environment of Russia is not prolific for a thriving business venture. I did not say it would be impossible, but it is extremely difficult and in the worst case scenario has a potential for backfiring. I made other suggestions such as implementing lower risk try-outs in St. Petersburg, or in different, but culturally similar, foreign markets. I also concluded the market entry strategy MAKU should start out with when they do decide to go into international business. It should be the use of a Russian distributor and later on to try out the piggyback method, when some international experience is gathered.

"A radical guide for starting a revolutionary business, from the charismatic, unconventional co-founder of UK-based craft beer company BrewDog and cohost of EsquireTV's BREWDOGS. After practicing law for all of two weeks, James Watt walked out on his legal career to start BrewDog craft brewery with his best friend, Martin Dickie. They didn't do it with a business plan; they did it with a mission to revolutionize beer drinking in the UK, to put flavor back into beer glasses and make other people as passionate about craft beer as they are. Since 2007, BrewDog has become the fastest growing food and drink manufacturer in the UK, employing over 500 people, and shipping their award-winning BrewDog beer to over 50 countries, including the US. Watt is also the star of the BREWDOGS TV show, which airs on the Esquire Network. "--

"Updated business wisdom from the founder of Dogfish Head, the nation's fastest growing independent craft brewery Starting with nothing more than a home brewing kit, Sam Calagione turned his entrepreneurial dream into a foamy reality in the form of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of America's best and fastest growing craft breweries. In this newly updated Second Edition, Calagione offers a deeper real-world look at entrepreneurship and what it takes to operate and grow a successful business. In several new chapters, he discusses Dogfish's most innovative marketing ideas, including how social media has become an integral part of the business model and how other small businesses can use it to catch up with bigger competitors. Calagione also presents a compelling argument for choosing to keep his business small and artisanal, despite growing demand for his products. Updated to offer a more complete look at what it takes to keep a small business booming An inspiring story of renegade entrepreneurialism and the rewards of dreaming big, working hard, and thinking unconventionally Shows how to use social media to reach new customers and grow a business For any entrepreneur with a dream, Brewing Up a Business, Second Edition presents an enlightening, in-depth look at what it takes to succeed on their own terms."--Provided by publisher.
