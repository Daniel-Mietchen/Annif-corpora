Battle of Gettysburg
The story begins with the grand cavalry battles and skirmishes that marked the beginning of Lee's epic invasion of the North. The author follows the pattern of events that led both armies to the crossroads town of Gettysburg where the terrible whirlwind of battle intensified. The awful second day of the fight is presented in grim detail with a complete accounting of savage thrust and counterthrust. The book investigates the planning that led to the panoramic charge of General Pickett's command which ended in disaster. Finally there is the grim march from the battlefield as the Confederates retreated to Virginia timidly pursued by the victorious Federals. Supplementing the narrative are sidebars giving nuts-and-bolts information about the battle. These cover in detail such topics as strategy, tactics, logistics, and personalities. Also included are maps that cover the movements of armies to Gettysburg and the tactical ploys for each day of the battle.
